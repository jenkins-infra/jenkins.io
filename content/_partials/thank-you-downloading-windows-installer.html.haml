  Changing boot configuration

%p
  By default, your Jenkins runs at 
  %a{:href => 'http://localhost:8080/'}
    https://localhost:8080/. 
  This can be changed by editing 
  %code
    jenkins.xml
  , which is located in your installation directory. This file is also the place to change other boot configuration parameters, such as JVM options, HTTPS setup, etc.
    
%h2 
  Starting/stopping the service
  
%p
  Jenkins is installed as a Windows service, and it is configured to start automatically upon boot. To start/stop them manually, use the service manager from the control panel, or the 
  %code
    sc 
  command line tool.
  
%h2
  Inheriting your existing Jenkins installation
  
%p
  If you'd like your new installation to take over your existing Jenkins data, copy your old data directory into the new  
  %code
    JENKINS_HOME
  directory.
