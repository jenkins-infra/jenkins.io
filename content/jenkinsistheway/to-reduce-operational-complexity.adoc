== Using Jenkins to automate operational tasks so that non-technical people could work without the need for developers' input.

*Background:* We aim to create the best job board for users in the Polish market. Thanks to our day-to-day work and commitment, we are perceived by our users as an efficient and reliable partner, providing top-notch professional services and meeting our clients' expectations and needs. We implement the most innovative solutions and functionalities - the result of our cooperation with worldwide leaders in IT technologies, and we believe it is crucial to constantly improve our service.

To that end, our main challenges were in software development: lifting the burden of developers and empower non-technical people in the company. 

*Goals:* Automating operational tasks

*Solution & Results: * Our approach was to create a pipeline for each of our needs, from a software release to report creation, with triggers from a VCS push or a POST from an internal website.

The key functionality we relied on were automation, triggered builds, and scheduling.

As for results, here is what we noticed:

* Load on technical staff is reduced greatly 
* Non-technical members have greater auto
