== Automating the entire CI/CD infrastructure shortened release cycles from weeks to hours.

*Background:* For Fintech and Insurance clients, there are many software development challenges, but the most significant issues are the time it takes to build, the need to improve product quality through testing, and the holdup that testing may cause, which can delay releases. We needed an automated infrastructure process when it comes to continuous integration and delivery. And we needed to get software into a production environment with speed, safety, and reliability.

*Goals:*  Use Jenkins to improve the build, test, and deployment processes.

"Jenkins rocks with very detailed documentation, extensive sample codebase, and good support from Jenkins experts."

*Solution & Results:*  We settled on Jenkins to help remove some of the manual hurdles in our automated process for the entire CI/CD infrastructure, including installing Jenkins plugins, creating users, their roles and credentials, and dynamic customization of pipelines to customer's platforms. 

Jenkins has a number of key capabilities that we found helpful, not the least of which are declarative pipelines, extensions through a wide variety of plugins, and of course, Docker support.

Results were impressive and included:

* improved product quality by increasing the number of automated tests by 30% 
* shortened the build times by 50% 
* faster release cycle (from weeks to hours)
