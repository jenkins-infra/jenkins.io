== Automating image deployment with Jenkins at LinuxWorld.

*Background:* _The LinuxWorld India training program allows students to work on live projects provided by the organization. In this way, they get real exposure to the IT industry. LinuxWorld offers training in the city of Jaipur, with a team of highly experienced and expert trainers. The students can enroll in programs like DevOps, Docker, Splunk, Cloud Computing, Big Data Hadoop, RedHat certified programs, Python, Splunk, python during their training program._

I am an ML engineer intern with Congle India and a student at Jaipur Engineering College. I am sharing the DevOps project I tackled at Linux World. I was tasked with integrating DevOps, Jenkins, and Docker to automate the deployment of the web pages. I am a beginner working with Jenkins, but it has been an excellent training resource for me to learn and do the work. 

*Goals:* To create a container image with Jenkins installed using Dockerfile so that the image will launch automatically when Jenkins starts its services.

**Solution & Results: **By using the Jcontainer image that has Jenkins installed, we can successfully – and automatically – launch the image once Jenkins is deployed. To do so, I created the following job chain using the build pipeline plugin in Jenkins:

*Job 1:* Pull the Github repo automatically when developers push the repo to Github. No alt-text was provided for this image.

*Job 2:* By looking at the code or program file, Jenkins should automatically start the respective language interpreter and install an image container to deploy the code. For example, if the code is PHP, then Jenkins should start the container that has PHP already installed. No alt-text was provided for this image.

*Job 3:* Test your app to determine if it is working or not. No alt-text was provided for this image.

*Job 4:* If the app is not working, send an email to the developer with error messages: No alt-text provided for this image.

By using Jenkins to automate the container image, it was:

* faster
* automated
* worked earlier
