== Building a large CI platform to support app development.

*Background: This technology company offers a note-taking app that understands any handwritten content. It is deployed in hundreds of millions of touch screens globally; in mobile devices, vehicles, interactive whiteboards, etc. For that, this tech team needed a large continuous integration platform to support its large user base, multiple translations, and to accelerate feature releases at scale.*

*Goals:*  Build a large CI platform to support note-taking applications and character recognition.

"Jenkins helps us to manage many nodes at a large scale."

*Solution & Results:* To create our CI platform, we relied on several Jenkins instances, many build nodes, and top-of-the-line hardware. The Jenkins capabilities deployed included node managements, many plugins, and pipeline jobs.

Jenkins helps us to manage many nodes at a large scale. It also yielded great results, including:

* quicker builds
* better node management 
* pipelines
