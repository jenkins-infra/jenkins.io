  This UK-based grocery retailer wanted to put automation first and foremost,
  ensure that they respected bespoke systems, and kept the learning curve to a
  minimum. They did it all with Jenkins.

== The flexibility for Jenkins was -- and is -- critical to a large established retail organization.

*Background:* Our main challenges were as follows;

. Automation first: There is no current automation from development to deployment. Moving to an automation-first principle, we wanted a pipeline that fit this need.
. Bespoke needs: As a heavily bespoke internal/on-prem environment, with a number of 3rd party applications and integrated systems, we needed a development pipeline that provided the flexibility to 'fit' around these requirements as these are not going away anytime soon.
. Minimize the learning curve: Yes, let's t-shape, but do it smart!
. Future-proof: What gives us confidence that we can achieve this?
. Faster and regular deployments: Go faster...but how?

*Goals:* Our main goal was to provide a consistent platform for internal shared services at Sainsburys.

"Shared libraries were a huge benefit to us. Jenkins provides all capabilities to integrate easily with numerous mainstream and bespoke systems."

*Solution & Results:Â * We dealt with our objectives/challenges thus;

* *Automation First:* We are already heavy users of GitHub, thus integration with that was a given need. Jenkins hooks into GitHub, meaning this was a quick win, with just a tiny amount of understanding of 'how,' there was no need for any tremendous upskilling -- meaning developers could keep on developing as they had been!
* *Bespoke Needs:* We found that the Jenkins pipeline provided ease of integration with other services like AWS, ServiceNow, CheckMarx, MS. Teams/Slack, to name but a few, either using open source plugins or some custom groovy/bash script. Using this aspect of Jenkins meant we could achieve this need.
* *Keep the learning curve to a minimum:* A few of us already had some Jenkins exposure in previous roles; using Jenkins meant that we were keeping a narrower tech scope than, say, if we were to use a managed service like that provided by AWS/Azure, thus minimizing any learning curve required for this. Plus, learnings are always shared.
* *Future proofing (well, as best as possible!):* We were moving toward a microservices architecture. Jenkins already had a proven history in this tech. Once again, this was a really easy argument to win. Using Jenkins in/with K8s opens up a whole world of functionality and future-proofing for many years.
* *Go faster:* With Jenkins? YES, OF COURSE, GO FASTER!!

We used the following capabilities:

* Shared libraries
* Kubernetes plugin
* OAuth plugin (for SSO integration)
* AWS plugins (S3, Credentials, Lambda, Secrets Mgr)
* Emailer plugin
* MS Teams plugin
* Cucumber reporting plugin

The results were overwhelmingly positive:

* 100% confidence in a consistent and repeatable pipeline
* Faster deployment times - from 5 days to several minutes
* Easy onboarding for new applications
* Easy integration with bespoke systems
