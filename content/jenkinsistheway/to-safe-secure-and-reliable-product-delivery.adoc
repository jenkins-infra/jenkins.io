== Using Jenkins to help lead the way in which apps are written, deployed, and consumed in financial services.

*Background:* At Finastra, we're working to unlock the power of finance by building and delivering innovative, next-generation technology on our open platform software architecture and cloud ecosystem. We're one of the world's largest FinTechs, working with over 9,000 customers including 90 of the top 100 banks globally. We like to say that we're changing how financial software is developed and used. 

Our open architecture approach brings together a number of partners and innovators. And together we are leading the way in which applications are written, deployed, and consumed in financial services. But as we build for customers, there is no way we can take the build logs in detail as per our requirement to check the status of the build, who built it, when it's built, what are the changes, etc. This will give us details whenever an anomaly happens.

*Goals:*  To make sure the code build is always secure before being deployed to any environment to avoid hacks like SolarWinds.

*Solution & Results:*  Jenkins came to our rescue and provides detailed information on the build and its metadata. 

The Jenkins community -- and the Cloudbees team -- helped us identify where the information is found in Jenkins, how it's stored, and how to retrieve it. 

Jenkins' system maintains detailed information related to each build to identify what happens during each stage of the build so we can do triage by identifying where the issue is in a very short time and fixing it quickly.

The key capabilities we relied on were varied and included Jenkins metadata, server information, Jenkins build logs.

The results are exactly what we were looking for.

* The ability to identify problem areas quickly
* Have a predictable analysis of build flow at our fingertips
* It's great to be able to secure the build immediately
