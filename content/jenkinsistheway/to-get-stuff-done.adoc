== Accelerating core software development.

*Background: A solid and secure technology platform is a critical foundation for any bank. But for this development team, there was a need to enable rapid innovation while simultaneously reducing manual intervention. They needed a complete CI/CD solution for fast, agile, and simplified development as well as a more streamlined deployment process for the entire company.*

*Goals: To accelerate core software development.*

"Jenkins rocks because it solved all our problems and fulfilled our dreams."

*Solution & Results: * We implemented a sturdy solution using Jenkins, BitBucket and Maven. And we wrote a number of custom scripts to enable our solution. Based on the nature of our products, we had to get creative, as most of the solutions out there weren't really a good fit. **

After a lot of brainstorming, scripting, coding and diagramming, the end product is something we can be proud of. Basically, it solved all our problems and fulfilled our dreams. Results we're experiencing include:**

* Simplified & streamlined deployment process 
* Introduction of coding and development standards 
* Cut manual deployment efforts almost entirely
