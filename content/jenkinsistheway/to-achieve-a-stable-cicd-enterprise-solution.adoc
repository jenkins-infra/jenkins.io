  his Bulgarian financial institution wanted to automate the build-and-deploy
  processes across the entire company. Despite some internal security
  roadblocks, they were able to do so with Jenkins.

== TIME Center CI/CD solution




*Background:* The tools for this finance company are heavily restricted, so the tech team was spending an inordinate amount of time trying to figure out what to use and how to execute necessary tasks. The security constraints imposed on them limited them significantly – particularly when it came to the use of plugins.  Because of this, they were forced to use extensive bash scripts to supplement the tools provided. Another huge challenge was the need to trial all possible solutions for each of the necessary steps to be confident they designed things correctly. Finally, they had to figure out how to incorporate BladeLogic into the CI/CD picture.

*Goals:*  Automate the build-and-deploy process for this organization.

*"Jenkins provided the platform to automate our builds whereas before all tasks were executed manually. "* image:/images/jenkinsistheway/Jenkins-logo.png[image,width=185,height=256] Emil Vulkov, Senior Systems Engineer

*Solution & Results: * We used Jenkins to provide the orchestration needed for each build and deployment. With Jenkins, we were able to make the connection to Nexus repository, pull source code from BitBucket, and create the BladeLogic packages.  Unfortunately, due to all of the internal security restrictions, we could only rely on basic Jenkins capabilities. Our team wanted to use Groovy scripts from the onset, but we ended up filling pre- and post-build steps, replacing several plugins with bash scripts (as the Jenkins agent is on RHEL).  

Jenkins rocks because it provided the platform to automate our builds, whereas previously,  all tasks were executed manually.  Since the implementation:

* builds are faster
* builds have fewer errors
* deployment is automated and fast => happier banks
* our BitBucket and Nexus libraries are managed and maintained with fewer errors
