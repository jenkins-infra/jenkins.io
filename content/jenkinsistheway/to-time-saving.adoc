== Creating new pipelines from those in use, the dev cycle at this fashion e-commerce site is now 10 times faster.

*Background:* Modanisa.com launched in 2011 and is the first Turkish fashion platform to deliver online clothes shopping to our target audience with a lot of variety. Born in Istanbul, we now have customers in 140 countries. We offer content in 6 languages: Turkish, Arabic, English, French, German, and Bahasa. We sell over 650 brands and 70 thousand products, shipping thousands of packages a day to five continents. We are the co-creator of the Modest Fashion Week concept, which made its debut in Istanbul in 2016.

*Goals:*  Our goal is to improve our online ordering and multi warehouse processes and create a better e-commerce experience.

"We have an immutable pipeline and deployed branch-based development needs. With Jenkins declarative pipelines, we are quickly delivering our applications to dev/test/staging/QA and production environments. Thanks a lot!"

*Solution & Results:*  Jenkins helps us with Multi-branch pipelines and declarative pipelines which really did solve our complex challenges. Every developer can create his project with a specific branch and deploy it to the specific domain which is its own. The key capabilities we relied on were Multi-Branch Pipelines, Declarative Pipelines, and RBAC.

The results are typical of many other Jenkins installations:

* Our development release cycle is 10x faster 
* Generally, all deployments have been shortened from 1 day to 10 minutes 
* When we have a new service and pipeline, we can easily duplicate and create a new one by using an older one as a standard
