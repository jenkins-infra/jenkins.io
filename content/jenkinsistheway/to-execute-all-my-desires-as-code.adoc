  Just under 4 years old, Brix is one of the fastest-growing mid-sized companies
  in Israel. Now their software development process is just as fast thanks to
  Jenkins.

== A Jerusalem-based FinTech software house automates builds -- with no mouse clicks.

*Background:* Jenkins was inside the firewall, and Azure was outside. We needed a tool to sample Azure every 2 minutes, check for code changes, and when found, start tracking the Azure pipeline, until completion. 

When completed, the next stages are to create a release in Octopus, create a deployment on dev, test it, and continue to QA, STG, and so on. Additional/optional stages: request approval through Slack / Jira run other Jenkins jobs with tests run by pull requests, and more.

*Goals:*  Connecting Jenkins to Azure pipelines and Octopus deploy

*Solution & Results:* We created a shared library, containing all the API calls we needed, in Octopus, Azure, Jira, Slack, and more. We added all the logic behind them, created a pipeline template as a Groovy method, and in that way, all the 30+ different products could use the same pipeline template, with a tiny Jenkins file that is only passing parameters, and calling the main template.

We are very happy with the results:

* Automated build, with no mouse clicks 
* We now have a rich shared library  for all of the company to utilize 
* Bypass firewall issue 
* Starting the CI/CD process
