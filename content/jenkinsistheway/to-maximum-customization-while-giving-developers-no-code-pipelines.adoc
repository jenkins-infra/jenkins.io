== The configuration of pipeline-as-code with Jenkins reduced upgrades from 2 days to 2 hours.

*Background:* Our team needed to have enough flexibility to be able to write everything in code. We also needed to have IDE support and to test the solution as a project. More importantly, we sought to make use of the entire existing ecosystem already built around Jenkins.

*Goals:*  Providing pipelines for everybody without the need to code.

*Solution & Results:*  In addition to Jenkins Pipelines, we turned to Matrix Authorization Plugin, Kubernetes Plugin, and Gradle for our key capabilities. Our solution was an A-Grade project with lots of abstraction and tight integration with our infrastructure provider. In doing so, we were able to automatically test the pipeline code with a minimal amount of clicks.

We achieved superior results with Jenkins Pipelines, including:

* Onboarding of teams 100x faster
* Confidence in pipeline code increased to 99%
* Upgrades that take less than 2 hours compared to 2 days of downtime before
