== Reducing infrastructure costs and accelerating pipeline delivery by nearly half.

*Background: * This development and engineering team was tasked with enhancing the Continuous Deployment solution for the Brazilian division of an international online retailer. For this, they sought to create a unique pipeline to support all stages. Their primary challenge in doing so was the need to use conditionals.

*Goals:*  Reduce costs with infrastructure by using dynamic agents for the Continuous Deployment process.

*"Jenkins rocks because it is a customizable robust solution that helped us reduce pipeline time by 50% – including deployment – and resource costs by 40%."* image:/images/jenkinsistheway/leandrocostam_photo.jpeg[leandrocostam_photo,width=576,height=768] Leandro Martins, DevOps Engineer

*Solution & Results:*  To achieve our goals, we introduced a Jenkins Declarative Pipeline using EC2 Dynamic Instances combined with Blue Ocean. We were able to spin up agents just when needed, which was vital for this endeavor.

Using a multi-branch project and the right conditionals on Pipeline, we discovered that we could reduce the build times by up to 60%. We also were able to reduce costs by using spot instances by up to 40%. The new pipeline provided the capability to build and deploy the artifact to our specific environment.

Jenkins rocks because it is a customizable, robust solution, and it yielded great results:

* reduced the pipeline time by 50% including the deployment process
* reduced resource costs by 40%
* provided pipeline visualization – using Blue Ocean –  which was helpful for developers
