== Better visibility and bigger, badder pipelines.

*Background:* TOPIC develops digital hardware, FPGA and software for customers. From board design, low-level driver development to application development for desktop, web and mobile. We support as a consultant, but also provide in-house projects and healthcare solutions. Unfortunately, pipeline limitations slowed us down. 

*Goals:* Create a large pipeline to automate the qualification process.

"Jenkins has the ability to create amazing pipelines!"

*Solution & Results:* Using JENKINS pipelines enabled us to execute our complete qualification process during the night. Manual steps are removed/solved to make this happen. This automated the process, with some parts executed in parallel and in different nodes. Both the release cycle and  the visualization increased tremendously. All results are visible in Jenkins, and everybody has access to those results. We use pipelines with Jenkins files in a Git repo. Also, Blue Ocean is rocking!

Result?

* Release cycle from days to one night 
* Quality improved by removing manual actions 
* Insanely better visibility
