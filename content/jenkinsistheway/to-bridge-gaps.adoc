== It's simple. We used Jenkins to turn dev machines on, off, and on again - automatically.

*Background:* This was just a basic project. We had to make sure all the deployment machines are up and running because every machine can run up to 50 hrs from the start, and then they will be switched off. So we had to update run time manually but later we used Jenkins and automated it.

*Goals:*  The goal was to make sure all the deployments/machines are up and running.

"Since we were using multiple machines, Jenkins helped to maintain all of them from a single job."

*Solution & Results:* We used the Jenkins Cron job to make sure all the machines are systematically shut down and restarted as required. It was very simple and it didn't even require any plugins.

Our results were also very simple - and very successful!

* Result #1 -- No downtime 
* Result #2 -- Internal stakeholders can access the machine 
* Result #3 -- No manual run
