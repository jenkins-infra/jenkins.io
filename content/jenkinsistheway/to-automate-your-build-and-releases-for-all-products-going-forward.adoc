== Keeping up with the pace of integrations with a smarter build and release process.

*Background:* I work for a company that creates intelligent and insight driven software that

enables manufacturers to build value chains that sense, learn, and adapt. Because of that we were experiencing the number of integrations increasing every month. This was making it hard to manage the deployments and rollbacks in an effective way.

*Goals:*  Integrate different business units.

"Because of Jenkins, developers can now focus on the goal of the project -- such as  developing the features for our customer -- and worry less about the build and release processes and issues that come with it."

*Solution & Results:*  We introduced Jenkins for our build and release process. Initially, some extra time had to be spent setting up our integrations on Jenkins. But once that was set up, our releases were straight forward and had no manual errors. Redeployment became easy. Managing and documenting releases was even easier, too. There was no more dependency on project people for the release process. Simple steps could be followed by any team member to do the release.

We relied on the following key capabilities:

* Jenkins integration with multiple source code repositories
* Automation in build and release processes

Results using Jenkins included:

* Problem free releases
* Less dependency on project team members 
* Faster releases
