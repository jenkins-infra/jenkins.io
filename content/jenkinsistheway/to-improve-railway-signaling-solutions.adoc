== Jenkins pipelines help improve railway signaling performance and empower developers with better DevOps processes.

*Background:* For our railway software, we needed to improve the quality, stability and delivery time of a legacy project, while giving our team a way of working smarter and faster. 

*Goals:*  Monitoring and operation of embedded railway traffic management systems.

"Jenkins improved and simplified our way of working. But also it increased our product quality and stability."

**Solution & Results:**We migrated almost all components from a Subversion repository where, most of the time, people are working on a trunk branch to a Bitbucket Repository and Jenkins Pipeline. 

Now every change is a node on a dedicated branch and merged after a reviewed pull request and successful Jenkins build.

We achieved superior  results with Jenkins Pipelines, including:

* Fewer failed unit tests
* Improved code quality, by doing code reviews for every pull request
* Increased transparency and awareness of code changes
* Easier testing
* Build stability; Our master build is now much more stable
