== Jenkins automates software deployment processes for a leading telecom company

*Background*: Palestine Telecommunications Company PLC (Paltel) is a Palestine-based communication company. At Paltel, we design and implement WiFi network infrastructure for customer networks via Fortinet AP and Fortigate. We also work with Cisco routers, Switches, and Mikrotik RouterBoard for other customer's networks. We support all customers using fiber optic technology. To ensure an optimal process, we needed a robust CI/CD.

*Goals*:Â  Software deployment automation

*Solution & Results:* We turned to Jenkins and GitHub Source Control Systems for our CI/CD tools. We leverage Jenkins for both our Voip plugins and Web Development.

With this, we have been able to:

* earn more money
* secure more clients
* scale our workload
