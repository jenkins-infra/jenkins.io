== Security, automation and software acceleration with Jenkins.

*Background:* My company needed to improve our DevOps environment. As the test engineer, I wanted to make sure the environment was secure. I sought to automate processes as we would manually start and browse results of Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) after each software component change.

*Goals:* Deliver secure software to network elements.

*Solution & Results: *

Jenkins was used to integrate and automate Static Application Security Testing and Dynamic Application Security Testing tools. When there is a change in any component that is a part of our software, Jenkins automatically starts its jobs. With its functionality, team members receive an email notification if there's a new finding in our software.

We use email notifications to inform team members about results. Additionally, we are using a plot to visualize security errors in each build.

We were thrilled with the results, which have included:

* Improved product security 
* Shortened development release cycles  
* Elimination of the need for the team to perform manual work
