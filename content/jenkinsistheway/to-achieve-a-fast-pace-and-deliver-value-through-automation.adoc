== Automating – and accelerating – application builds, delivery +
and infrastructure to deliver value.

*Background:* At our customer services software company, we need to be able to automate as much as we can as possible to make customer onboarding a pleasant process. Our platform needs to be fast and reliable. For that, we decided to use pipelines to: 

* Automate the new environment 
* Set user accounts 
* Automatically communicate to our customers
* Accelerate the processes for new user/customer onboarding 

*Goals:*  Create a chatbot platform.

"The flexibility of Jenkins and Jenkins plugins let us deliver incredible products. It makes our life easier by automating all the toil we had." image:/images/jenkinsistheway/alexandre.jpeg[image,width=200,height=200] Alexandre Mioranza, SRE, ZenviaName

*Solution & Results:*  The solution we came up with includes:

* A repository 
* User accounts creation
* Deployment of 3 microservices
* Customer-generated API keys 
* Customer notification of all the information they need to access and use the platform

We implemented this using lots of plugins that we were able to connect to our other systems. We built very flexible pipelines using Jenkins, and we developed groovy functions to encapsulate business logic and many other functionalities.

Results using Jenkins included:

* A faster process to onboard new customer 
* Low-cost process
* Easy-to-change workflows
* Operational efficiency
