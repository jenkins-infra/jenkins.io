== Reducing developer frustration with an automated solution that works with a variety of circumstances and operating systems.

*Background:*  As we are an agile development team, it was important to us that the deployment process was automatic and most importantly fast. Especially, since it is an early-stage project, a lot of features are added over a short period of time.

*Goals:*  The main goal of this project was to execute legacy applications on new hardware.

"Jenkins made writing code and deploying fun again."

*Solution & Results:*  

Since the team had already a lot of experience with Jenkins, we knew that the configuration and deployment would be a breeze. Jenkins allowed us to apply our custom pipeline processes and enabled us to simulate different types of hardware. 

With this, we had the confidence that our solution works on a variety of operating systems and under various circumstances. Further, we could easily deploy our application so customers could make use of the new features quickly.

Features and plugins used included JUnit, SonarQube integration, and GitHub integration. 

The results were better than expected. We experienced:

* a new release every week 
* better code quality, due to automatic checks
* much less frustration, since (nearly) no manual labor was required
