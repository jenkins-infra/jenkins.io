== Helping new tech startups shorten the path between application and audience.

*Background:* Many start-up companies do not have DevOps areas internally, however they have the need to deploy their applications quickly. This turned out to be a challenge, which is why we created Dopster. We are a PaaS platform and open innovation hub, aimed at software developers. We provide support for companies in public cloud services, DevOps and security.

*Goals:* Fast automation using Jenkins pipelines for all projects that Dopster supports.

*Solution & Results:* Jenkins made it possible to streamline the standard pipeline models using Groovy, which we then use to compile and deploy applications demanded for Dopster automatically, according to the project language, through git.

In addition we relied on Blue Ocean, Build Statistics, Gitlab and Github's plugins, and Kubernetes and Docker's plugins.

The results are typical of many other Jenkins installations:

* Continuous deploy after defined pipeline
* Our customers are very satisfied
* When we have change necessities, it's so fast!
