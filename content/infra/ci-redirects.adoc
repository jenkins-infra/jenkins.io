My build notifier is being redirected from
link:https://ci.jenkins.io[ci.jenkins.io]
to this page! Help!

There have been a number of "Build Notifier" tools/scripts that have hit
link:https://ci.jenkins.io[ci.jenkins.io]
over the years, because it is a highly visible Jenkins installation and makes
for a good out-of-the-box default.

The problem with *many* of these tools is that they impose unnecessary and
sometimes even _abusive_ loads on our Jenkins installation.


If you are being redirected to this page, that means you are using a known
"Build Notifier" which has been responsible for unnecessary/abusive traffic to
our infrastructure (see also:
link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-917[INFRA-917]
).

NOTE: We have introduced this page as an alternative to banning IP addresses that
send traffic. That is still an option if abusive traffic persists.
