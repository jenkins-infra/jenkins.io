I deployed <a href="http://kohsuke.org/2012/06/22/potd-confluence-static-cache-generator-plugin/">a new static cache frontend</a> to <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins Wiki</a> a few days ago.<br>
<br>
<p><br>
This change should be mostly invisible to users, except that hopefully you would notice that the pages load a lot faster.<br>
<br>
<p><br>
Also some pages use macros that doesn't work well with caches. For example, the <tt>chart</tt> macro appears to use one-time URL to generated images, so they cannot be cached. For those pages, add <tt>nocache</tt> as a label, and the page will not be cached.<br>
<br>
<p><br>
If you see some glitches in the caching behaviour, let us know!
