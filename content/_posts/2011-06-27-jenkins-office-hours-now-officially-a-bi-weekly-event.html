In May, we launched <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Office+Hours">Jenkins Office Hours</a>.  This was inspired by <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+plugin+development+in+Ruby">Jenkins Ruby hack sessions</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/cowboyd">cowboyd</a>, and the idea is to use an interactive online meeting to drive some sub-projects, bootstrap new plugin developers by pointing them to the right extension points, and/or bringing existing community members to discuss some specific key parts of Jenkins and its plugins.<br>
<br>
<p><br>
The <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/User+Office+Hours+Week+20">first</a> <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Dev+Office+Hours+Week+20">two</a> meetings were very popular, but our trial WebEx account expired, and since then we were looking for a sponsor to host this event. And I am happy to report that with a help from Max Spring, now we can get the office hours going again.<br>
<br>
<p><br>
So the Jenkins office hours will be bi-weekly events, starting this Wednesday (6/29). <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Office+Hours">See the wiki page</a> for details and agenda</a>. Looking forward to seeing you!<br>
