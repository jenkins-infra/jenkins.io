Jenkins has lots of documentation, and we appreciate any contributions to it:
new docs, design and styling, copy-editing, reviews, etc.

We coordinate and discuss documentation efforts in the link:/sigs/docs[Documentation Special Interest Group].
You can reach out to us in the mailing list or on link:[https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/docs[Gitter, and you can also join our link:/sigs/docs/#meetings[regular meetings.
See the contacts on the right sidebar.

== Where to find documentation?

There are many documentation sources in Jenkins.
This website and the link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/[plugins site] are the most notable ones,
but we also have docs in other places (GitHub repositories, various sites like link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/javadoc[javadoc.jenkins.io] or link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/[Jenkins Wiki] which is currently being deprecated).
For the most of the repositories we try to follow the documentation-as-code approach.

== Newcomers

If you are a newcomer, documentation is a great place to contribute.
A lot of small patches can be done from the GitHub's web interface even without forking repositories and cloning them locally.
You can open any GitHub Markdown or Asciidoc page in any Jenkins repo, click _Edit_ on the page, modify and preview changes in the web interface, and then propose a change.

== Featured projects

Currently we are working on migrating the documentation from Jenkins Wiki to GitHub and jenkins.io.
See link:/blog/2019/10/21/plugin-docs-on-github/[this blog post] for more information about the reasons why we do this migration.
This migration involves modification of hundreds of pages and repositories, and we invite everyone to contribute.
