As it is intended for daily use by finicky web developers, Jenkins design and user experience are essential.
We invite designers to improve Jenkins, its website, and to create new artwork for the project.

=== Artwork

Jenkins Area Meetups love special Jenkins art for their meetup, and some plugins are important enough to deserve their own logo. You can check the link:/artwork/[gallery] for some amazing contributions, or propose your own on the link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io[website repository].

=== Design

Jenkins itself could also use some eye candy; dive into the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins[Jenkins repository] for places to start, or browse the issues on link:https://issues.jenkins.io[Jira]

You can also propose your pixel-perfect css improvements and/or images for Jenkins.io on the link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io[website repository].
