== Contribute

=== Artwork

Jenkins Area Meetups love special Jenkins art for their meetup, and some plugins are important enough to deserve their own logo. You can check the link:/artwork/[gallery] for some amazing contributions, or propose your own on the link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io[website repository].

=== Design

Jenkins itself could also use some eye candy; dive into the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins[Jenkins repository] for places to start, or browse the issues on link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org[Jira]

You can also propose your pixel-perfect css improvements and/or images for Jenkins.io on the link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io[website repository].
