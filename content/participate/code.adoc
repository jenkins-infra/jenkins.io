The Jenkins project includes a substantial codebase, and we invite everyone to contribute. 
We use a diverse set of programming languages, including but not limited to:

* Java
* JavaScript
* Groovy
* Golang
* Ruby
* Shell scripts

Since Jenkins is an automation server with hundreds of plugins, there are countless technologies involved. 
Whether you are an expert or looking to learn something new while contributing, you'll find interesting opportunities in our project.

== Where to Contribute?

The Jenkins project is spread across multiple GitHub organizations. 
You are welcome to contribute to **any** repository in **any** of these organizations, or to any other Jenkins-related repository on GitHub.

https://github.com/jenkinsci[jenkinsci] (Main Organization)::
Jenkins core, plugins, and libraries reside here. 
To help classify our 1000+ repositories, we follow these naming conventions:
+
* Plugins are named `*-plugin`
* Libraries are named `lib-*`

https://github.com/jenkins-infra[jenkins-infra] (Infrastructure Organization)::
Contains Jenkins infrastructure code, including the website and supporting services.

[NOTE]
====
Various components in Jenkins have different review and delivery policies. 
Please see individual repository documentation for specific contributing guidelines.

=== Plugins

With over https://plugins.jenkins.io[2,000 plugins], plugins implement the majority of Jenkins functionality. 
Each plugin is an isolated component that can be developed independently using the APIs and development tools provided by the project.

Most Jenkins contributors work on plugins, making it an excellent way to start contributing. 
Here are key documentation resources:

* link:/doc/developer/[Jenkins Developer Documentation] — Comprehensive developer guides
* link:/doc/developer/plugin-development/[Plugin Development Tutorial] — Get started with plugin development
* link:/doc/developer/publishing/requesting-hosting/[Hosting and Publishing Guide] — Complete guide for publishing plugins
* link:/doc/developer/plugin-governance/adopt-a-plugin/[Adopt a Plugin] — Take ownership of abandoned plugins
* https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Before+starting+a+new+plugin[Before Creating a New Plugin] — Important considerations
* https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Pull+Request+to+Repositories[Pull Request Guidelines] — How we handle plugin pull requests

=== Jenkins Core

Jenkins core is the heart of any Jenkins installation. It provides:

* Kernel functionality
* Extension APIs used by plugins
* Standard web container
* Executable WAR file for running instances

Written primarily in Java, the core includes multiple components and frameworks.

Repository: https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins[jenkinsci/jenkins]

=== Infrastructure

As an independent open source project, Jenkins maintains its own infrastructure—from virtual machines and containers to network configuration and custom applications that improve development efficiency.

We apply Open Source principles to our infrastructure, operating as an open infrastructure project where everyone is invited to learn, share, and contribute.

=== Other Components

Beyond core, plugins, and infrastructure, we maintain hundreds of additional repositories:

* Libraries
* Packaging tools
* Developer utilities

Explore these through our link:/sigs[Special Interest Groups] and link:/projects[Sub-projects] pages.
