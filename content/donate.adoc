The Jenkins project operates thanks to individual and company contributors
investing their time and resources to maintain and evolve the project.
The best way to help the project is to link:/participate[participate and contribute],
volunteer time is the most precious resource for an open-source project. 
We will appreciate any contributions to the Jenkins: code, documentation, etc.
If you have no opportunity to contribute your time, we also appreciate donations of money and equipment.

You can donate here:

== Why donate?

Your donations help to keep the project going and to accelerate its evolution:

* Facilitating key initiatives within the link:/project/roadmap/[Jenkins Roadmap]:
  new features, documentation, user experience improvement, etc.
** Organizing community events and outreach programs
** Running self-funded link:/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/outreach-programs/[mentorship programs] like Outreachy and Community Bridge
** Swag for active Jenkins contributors
* Operating and infrastructure expenses not covered by existing sponsorships
** Certificates and domains for our websites, network transit costs, hardware for self-hosted services
** Cost of SaaS services not covered by sponsorships
* Organizing link:/events/online-meetup/[online], link:/projects/jam/[local] Jenkins meetups (swag, promotion materials)
* Funding the jep:12[Jenkins Travel Grant Program] to help community members to attend Jenkins related events.

Your contribution will *NOT* be used for paying personnel, for placing ads, or for other forms of commercial promotion.
The Jenkins project has no personnel on payroll, all contributions come from individual and company contributors.
Sponsorships cover most of our "big" expenses: most of the infrastructure costs, contributor summits, meetup accounts, swag, etc.
It allows spending the most of donations on targeted projects focused on evolving the project and the community.
Many initiatives we run require "just" hundreds or thousands of US dollars,
even small contributions can make a real difference for the project and its users.
