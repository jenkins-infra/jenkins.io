      Pipeline as Code
    keeps delivery
    %a{:href => 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself'}
      DRY
  %dd
    %p
      The new
      %a{:href => '/solutions/pipeline'}
        Pipeline
      functionality in Jenkins allows you to define configuration as code,
      which can be checked in and version controlled along with the rest of
      your project's source code.

    %img{:src => '/images/hello-world-pipeline.png', :title => 'A simple build/test pipeline'}/

    %p
      Defining your pipeline's configuration as code makes it easier to create
      a simple "build and test" pipeline, while enabling more advanced and
      complex pipelines through the expressive Groovy-based domain specific
      language.

  %dt
    Out of the box: Easy to get it right
  %dd
    %p
      For new users, Jenkins 2.0 starts off with set of recommended plugins to
      help get you started with the right set of tools to get up and running with
      Jenkins quickly.

      For the more adventurous users, the Jenkins 2.0 initial setup process
      also allows you to pick and choose exactly the plugins you want to meet
      your specific needs.

    %a{:href => '/images/getting-started-setup.png', :target => '_blank'}
      %img{:src => '/images/getting-started-setup.png', :title => 'Getting started with Jenkins 2.0',
          :width => 550}/

    %p
      Of course, users will always be able to add plugins after the initial
      setup through the current "Manage Plugins" interface.

  %dt
    Improved user interface
  %dd
    A number of small, but useful improvements, have been made to tidy up the
    interfaces you use every day.


  %dt
    Totally backwards compatible
  %dd
    Jenkins 2.0 is a drop-in replacement of the Jenkins 1.x series of releases
    and fully backward compatible. There will be practically no reason
    %em
      not
    to upgrade once 2.0 is released in the next couple of months.
