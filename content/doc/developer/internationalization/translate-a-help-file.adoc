This guide explains how to generate and translate help files used in Jenkins localization.

Stand-alone HTML files are often used in Jenkins for things like inline help messages.
To translate these resources, add the locale code between the file name and the extension.
For example, the Japanese version of `+abc.html+` would be `+abc_ja.html+`.
These files must be encoded in UTF-8.
