== What developers need to know/do

Jenkins' i18n support has some aspects that developers need to be aware
of.

. Generation of type-safe `+Messages+` classes from
`+Messages.properties.+`
. Marking messages in jelly files.
. Creation of html files for help tips.

=== Generation of `+Messages+` classes

Jenkins uses http://java.net/projects/localizer/[localizer] to generate
classes for accessing message resources in a type-safe way. For each
`+src/main/resources/**/Messages.properties+`, a Messages class is
generated. See the referenced page for how this class looks like. If
your IDE fails to find these classes, manually add
"target/generated-sources/localizer" directory to your source root.

Wherever the code returns a String for display purpose (such as
`+Descriptor.getDisplayName()+`), use the Messages class to obtain a
localized message. At the runtime, a proper locale is selected
automatically. A typical workflow for this is as follows:

. You identify messages that need be localized
. You place that in Messages.properties. One can choose to have this
file for each package, or you could just have one such file for the
whole module/plugin.
. You run `+mvn compile+` once to re-generate `+Messages.java+`
. Update your code to use the newly generated message formatting method

idea of how to do this.

|*Note:* If your message contains single quote character ('), then you
need to escape it with another single quote character (i.e. ''). So
"that's" becomes "that''s". If you're in need of an apostrophe character
you might consider using ’ - the unicode character U+2019, written in
properties file as \u2019.
|===

=== Marking messages in jelly files

Your jelly files in `+src/main/resources+` often contain messages that
need to be localized, and those need to be marked as well.

In the simplest case, suppose you have a part of a Jelly file that looks
like the following:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
....
<h1>Output</h1>
<p>...</p>
....

|===

Then all you need to do is to change this to the following:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
....
<h1>${%Output}</h1>
<p>...</p>
....

|===

The $\{%...} marker indicates stapler to look for localized resources,
and when none is found it'll just print "Output" for this, which is what
you want.

Let's consider the case where the localization requires parameters.
Suppose you have a Jelly file `+foo.jelly+` like this:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
....
<p>Click <a href="${obj.someMethod(a,b,c)}" >here</a></p>
....

|===

In this case, first you have to write `+foo.properties+` for the default
locale:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
....
click.here.link=Click <a href="{0}" >here</a>
....

|===

Then update `+foo.jelly+` to refer to this like this:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
....
<p>${%click.here.link(obj.someMethod(a,b,c))}</p>
....

|===

If you have multiple parameters you can pass them by separating ','
(just like a function call), and from property files you can reference
them as \{0}, \{1}, etc., by following
http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/text/MessageFormat.html[the
MessageFormat class convention].

Now consider the case where you put a message in an expression like
this. Suppose you have a Jelly file like this:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
....
<p>${h.ifThenElse(x,"no error","error")}</p>
....

|===

You can mark those two strings for localization like this:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
....
<p>${h.ifThenElse(x,"%no error","%error")}</p>
....

|===

Finally, because you can use expressions in Jelly, you need to ensure
your regular strings don't contain brackets. +
For example, this will *not* parse correctly, as it will be parsed as an
expression:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
....
<h1>${%Path to file (.ipa or .apk)}</h1>
....

|===

You need to create two separate strings in this case:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
....
<h1>${%Path to file} (${%.ipa or .apk})</h1>
....

|===

=== Creation of html files for help tips.

It is possible in jelly files to configure entries which can show a tip
message when the user clicks on a help icon.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
....
<f:entry title="${%title}" help="/plugin/myPlugin/help.html">
....

|===

Then, just create the file help.html for English or help_xx.html for the
'xx' language.

== What translators need to know/do

The Jenkins project always welcomes contributions to translations. If
you are interested in helping us, just file a pull request on GitHub. In
the remainder of this section, we'll discuss what needs to be translated
and how.

[cols="",]

|Remember that properties files must be encoded in
http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html[ISO
8859-1]. This should be the default anyway.

=== Translation tools

* https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Translation+Tool[Translation
Tool] : Command line tool to help translators to generate files, add
missing keys, and more.
* https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Translation+Assistance+Plugin[Translation
Assistance Plugin] : Adds a dialog box in Jenkins to translate and send
missing keys.

=== Translating `+Messages.properties+`

Developers place messages that require localizations in
`+Messages.properties+`. Those need to be translated in the usual
manner. See `+Messages_ja.properties+` in the core as an example if you
are new to this process.

Sometimes looking at `+Messages.properties+` alone doesn't give you
enough contextual information as to where the messages are used. For
this, developers are encouraged to access messages by using the
type-safe `+Messages+` class generated by
http://java.net/projects/localizer/[localizer]. To find out where
messages are actually used, use your IDE to find all the usages of the
message format method.

=== Translating message references in Jelly

The other messages that need to be translated are in Jelly view files,
which are in `+src/main/resources/**.jelly+`. To localize them, first
you run Maven to generate skeleton property file for your locale:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
....
$ cd jenkins/core  (or a plugin dir)
$ mvn stapler:i18n -Dlocale=fr
....

|===

This will generate a bunch of `+*_fr.properties+` all over
`+src/main/resources+` with an empty value. If the file already exists,
it will append missing entries to existing files.

You then need to work on each such property file and translate messages.
You don't have to translate the entire file — if you leave some entries
empty, they'll fall back to the default locale.

=== Translating static HTML resources

Stand-alone HTML files are often used in Jenkins for things like inline
help messages. These resources need to be translated by adding the
locale code between the file name and the extension. For example, the
Japanese version of `+abc.html+` would be `+abc_ja.html+`, and British
version of it could be `+abc_en_GB.html+`. These files need to be
encoded in UTF-8.

=== Pushing changes

Once you made some changes, you can commit them. Translators should
consider themselves as owning property files for their locale, so feel
free to go ahead and just commit. If you are new to this, doing a small
commit first is a good idea. You can also always send in a patch if you
prefer to be safe.

When starting a translation, try to check if there's anyone else working
on the same locale. You can find out who they are by finding existing
localization and looking at its history. Try to get in touch with them
to avoid a surprise.

== Stapler plugin for IntelliJ IDEA

Refactoring the existing code to handle i18n correctly is tedious. So
https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/IntelliJ+IDEA+plugin+for+Stapler[IntelliJ
IDEA plugin for Stapler] is developed to simplify this (note that
JetBrains kindly offered the open-source license for the Jenkins
project, so contributers can get the license for free — contact Kohsuke
if you need one.)

Once installed, this adds a menu item in the main menu, under
"Refactor." It is highly recommended to give some keyboard short cut to
this. I use "Ctrl+Alt+I": +
image:../images/developer/internationalization/menuItem.png[image,title="Jenkins > Internationalization > menuItem.png"] +
Now, to use this feature, select the message you'd like to
internationalize, then trigger this refactoring command. It'll ask you
the message property name for this, so pick a name: +
image:../images/developer/internationalization/before.png[image,title="Jenkins > Internationalization > before.png"] +
IDEA will place the message into the resource file, and adjust the code
accordingly. Note that an error is highlighted until you run
`+mvn compile+` again to generate new methods on the `+Messages+`
class. +
