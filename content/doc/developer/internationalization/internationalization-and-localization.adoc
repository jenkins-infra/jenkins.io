== What plugin developers need to do

Plugin developers internationalize a plugin by modifying the Java files and the Jelly files in the plugin.
They can significantly improve the translation experince by enabling Crowdin translation support for the plugin.
The steps include:

. link:/doc/developer/internationalization/i18n-source-code/[Internationalize messages in Java source code]
. link:/doc/developer/internationalization/i18n-jelly-views/[Internationalize messages in Jelly views]
. link:/doc/developer/crowdin/translating-plugins/[Enable Crowdin translation support for the plugin] (Optional)

link:/doc/developer/internationalization/prepare-a-java-source-file/[Prepare a Java source file for localization] shows the detailed internationalization steps.
The link:/doc/developer/internationalization/advanced-localization/[advanced localization] documentation provides guidance for more sophisticated internationalization, like date formatting, time formatting, and number formatting.

== What translators need to do

The Jenkins project welcomes contributions to translations.
Translators can contribute to plugin localizations through link:https://crowdin.jenkins.io/[Crowdin translations].
Crowdin simplifies translation work so that it focuses on the translation rather than the mechanics of pull requests and source files.

Translators can contribute to Jenkins core and plugins that are not registered with Crowdin by filing pull requests on GitHub.

In the remainder of this section, we discuss what needs to be translated and how.

=== Translation tools

* https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Translation-Tool[Translation
Tool] : Command line tool to help translators to generate files, add
missing keys, and more.
* https://plugins.jenkins.io/translation/[Translation
Assistance Plugin] : Adds a dialog box in Jenkins to translate and send
missing keys.

=== Translating `+Messages.properties+`

Developers place messages that require localization in
`+Messages.properties+`. Those need to be translated in the usual
manner. See `+Messages_ja.properties+` in the core as an example if you
are new to this process.

If looking at `+Messages.properties+` alone does not give you
enough contextual information about where the messages are used. you can access messages by with the
type-safe `+Messages+` class generated by
https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/1212/wls/WLAPI/weblogic/i18n/Localizer.html[Localizer]. To find out where
messages are actually used, use your IDE to find all the usages of the
message format method.

=== Translating static HTML resources

Stand-alone HTML files are often used in Jenkins for things like inline
help messages. To translate these resources, add the
locale code between the file name and the extension. For example, the
Japanese version of `+abc.html+` would be `+abc_ja.html+`, and the British
version of it could be `+abc_en_GB.html+`. These files must be
encoded in UTF-8.

=== Pushing changes

After making changes, please test them to confirm they are working as expected.
After successfully testing the changes interactively,
submit a pull request to propose the changes.
Instructions for localization pull requests to Jenkins core are available in the
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#proposing-changes[Jenkins core contributing guide].
Plugins that use Crowdin for translation can follow the
link:/doc/developer/crowdin/translating-plugins/[Crowdin translation instructions].
Plugins that do not use Crowdin for translation should submit a pull request according to
the contributing guide for the specific plugin.

When starting a translation, try to check if anyone else is working
on the same locale. You can find out who they are by finding existing
localization and looking at its history. Try to get in touch with them
to avoid a surprise.

== Jenkins Development Support plugin for IntelliJ IDEA

Refactoring the existing code to handle i18n correctly is tedious. So
https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1885-jenkins-development-support[IntelliJ IDEA plugin Jenkins Development Support]
is developed to simplify this.
