= Update minimum Jenkins version

Jenkins plugins declare a minimum supported Jenkins version.
The minimum Jenkins version is a good way for plugin developers to indicate the range of Jenkins versions they are willing to support and test.
The link:/doc/developer/plugin-development/choosing-jenkins-baseline[developer documentation] recommends the previous long term support version as the preferred base Jenkins version.

== Require recommended Jenkins version

Update the Jenkins base version by adding a `jenkins.version` entry to the properties section of the `pom.xml` file:

```
   <properties>
     <java.level>8</java.level>
+    <jenkins.version>PLACEHOLDER_NEWER_LTS_POINT_ONE</jenkins.version>
   </properties>
```
