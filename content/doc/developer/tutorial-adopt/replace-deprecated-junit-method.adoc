:task-description: Replace deprecated JUnit assertThat with Hamcrest assertThat

JUnit 4 provided an assertThat method.  The method has been deprecated in JUnit 4 in favor of the Hamcrest assertThat method.  Using the deprecated JUnit method confuses readers and makes it more difficult to write tests with Hamcrest assertions.

Need more description of the technique to make this change.
