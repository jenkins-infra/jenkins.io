= Add a link to “Report an Issue”

The plugins site link:https://plugins.jenkins.io[https://plugins.jenkins.io] includes a “Report an Issue” link for each of the plugins.  The linked page guides the user to provide a better classified issue and leads them to the correct path to privately report security issues.  

Add a heading in the plugin documentation that links to the specific “Report an Issue” link provided by the link:https://plugins.jenkins.io[https://plugins.jenkins.io] site.  Some plugins use GitHub issues.  The link from the link:https://plugins.jenkins.io[https://plugins.jenkins.io] site is the correct link to use in that case as well.

For example, the link for the git plugin is link:https://www.jenkins.io/participate/report-issue/redirect/#15543[https://www.jenkins.io/participate/report-issue/redirect/#15543] , while the link for the elastic axis plugin is link:https://www.jenkins.io/participate/report-issue/redirect/#17588[https://www.jenkins.io/participate/report-issue/redirect/#17588]
