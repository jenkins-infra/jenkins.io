:task-description: Automate dependency updates

Jenkins plugins frequently depend on external libraries and on other plugins.  Automatic dependency checks help assure that new releases of dependencies are reviewed by plugin maintainers. 

The GitHub `dependabot` tool can be configured to periodically check for new releases of dependencies. When a new release is detected, dependabot submits a pull request to include that update in the plugin pom file.

See the link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXIJpjYlECQ[Jenkins Online Meetup video] for more details on dependabot with Jenkins.

Automated dependency checks by dependabot are defined in a .github/dependabot.yml file.

``` bash
$ mkdir .github
$ cat > .github/dependabot.yml <<END-OF-HERE-DOC
