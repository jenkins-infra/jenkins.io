If the plugin repository does not already include a Jenkinsfile, add a `Jenkinsfile` so that link:https://ci.jenkins.io[ci.jenkins.io] will automatically compile and test the plugin and any pull requests submitted to the plugin.

Create a git branch for your local work with the command:

``` bash
$ git checkout -b add-Jenkinsfile
```

Create a file named ‘Jenkinsfile’ with the single line content:

``` groovy
buildPlugin()
```

Commit that change:

``` bash
$ git add Jenkinsfile
$ git commit -m "Add Jenkinsfile for ci.jenkins.io" -m "Compile and test PR’s automatically"
```

Push the change to GitHub:

``` bash
$ git push origin --set-upstream add-Jenkinsfile
