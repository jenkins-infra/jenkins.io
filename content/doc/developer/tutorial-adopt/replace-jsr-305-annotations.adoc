# Replace JSR-305 annotations with Spotbugs annotations

Annotations for `Nonnull`, `CheckForNull`, and a few others were proposed for Java as part of JSR-305.
The proposal never became a part of standard Java.
Jenkins plugins should switch from using JSR-305 annotations to use Spotbugs annotations that provide the same semantics.
