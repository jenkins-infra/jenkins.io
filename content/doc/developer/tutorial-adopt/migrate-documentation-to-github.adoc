:task-description: Migrate documentation to GitHub

Jenkins plugin documentation was originally maintained on a wiki.  The wiki was deprecated in 2019 due to spam and was shut down in 2021.  Plugin documentation should migrate to GitHub.  Instructions are available on the link:https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/publishing/wiki-page/#migrating-from-wiki-to-github[www.jenkins.io] site.

.Updates coming soon to that page to show the current locations that contain the exported wiki pages:

* link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs[https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs] for plugin docs as markdown
* link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/confluence-data[https://github.com/jenkins-infra/confluence-data] for entire wiki site as HTML
