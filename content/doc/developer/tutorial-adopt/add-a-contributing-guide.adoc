:task-description: Add a contributing guide

If the plugin does not already include a contributing guide, consider adding a contributing guide so that others understand how to help with plugin development. 

.The contributing guide often includes instructions to:
* Compile and run automated tests
* Run the plugin in a development environment
* Report code coverage of the plugin and its tests
* Report static analysis results

Refer to the contributing guides of other plugins for common examples.
