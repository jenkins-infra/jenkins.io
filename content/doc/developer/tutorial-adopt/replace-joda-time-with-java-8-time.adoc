:task-description: Replace joda-time with Java 8 time

Java 7 and prior had time libraries that were inadequate.  The joda-time library was created to provide better ways of handling time.  The joda-time library was used as the design basis for the Java 8 time libraries. The use of joda-time should be replaced by calls to the Java 8 time classes and methods.

Need more description of the technique to make this change.
