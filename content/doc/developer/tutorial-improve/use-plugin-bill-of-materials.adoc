Updating the versions of plugin dependencies manually can be exhausting, looking for the correct set of versions that work with each other and do not cause upper-bounds dependency error reports.
The link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/bom#bill-of-materials-for-jenkins-plugins[Jenkins plugin bill of materials] simplifies that by shifting the evaluation of versions from each plugin author to a centralized process maintained by members of the Jenkins community.

== Use the plugin bill of materials

Add a `dependencyManagement` section to the `dependencies` section of the pom file that references the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/bom/releases[most recent version] of the plugin bill of materials for that line.
For example, the addition might look like:

[source,xml]
----
<dependencyManagement>
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.jenkins.tools.bom</groupId>
      <artifactId>bom-2.401.x</artifactId>
      <version>2582.v830625dd636c</version>
      <scope>import</scope>
      <type>pom</type>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
----

Remove as many `<version>` declarations from the pom file as you can while still compiling successfully.

Compile the updated code with the command:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean verify
