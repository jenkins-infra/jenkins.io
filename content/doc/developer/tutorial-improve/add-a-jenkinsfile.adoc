= Add a Jenkinsfile

.Add a Jenkinsfile to the repository
video::Fev8KfFsPZE[youtube,width=800,height=420,start=807]

If the plugin repository does not already include a Jenkinsfile, add a `Jenkinsfile` so that link:https://ci.jenkins.io[ci.jenkins.io] will automatically compile and test the plugin and any pull requests submitted to the plugin.

// Create the branch
include::doc/developer/tutorial-improve/_create-a-branch.adoc[]

== Create the Jenkinsfile

Create a file named `Jenkinsfile` with the single line content:

``` groovy
buildPlugin()
```

// Create a pull request
include::doc/developer/tutorial-improve/_create-a-pull-request.adoc[]

A job will be automatically created in the link:https://ci.jenkins.io/job/Plugins/[ci.jenkins.io Plugins folder] after the pull request is merged and the GitHub organization folder is scanned by ci.jenkins.io.

For more details, see the link:/doc/developer/publishing/continuous-integration/[continuous integration] page for Jenkins developers.
