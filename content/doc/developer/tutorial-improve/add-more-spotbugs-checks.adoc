= Add more spotbugs checks

.Add more thorough spotbugs checks
video::2c8wK2jkcIA[youtube,width=800,height=420,start=255]

The Jenkins plugin pom enables static analysis with link:https://spotbugs.github.io/[spotbugs].
Plugin maintenance can be improved in some cases by increasing the depth of spotbugs analysis.

== Increase spotbugs checks

To increase the spotbugs analysis checks, add the spotbugs properties entries in the properties section of the `pom.xml` file:

[source,xml]
----
   <properties>
     <spotbugs.effort>Max</spotbugs.effort>
     <spotbugs.threshold>Low</spotbugs.threshold>
   </properties>
----

== Review and fix spotbugs warnings

When the spotbugs analysis checks are increased, they often report new issues that need to be resolved or suppressed.
Spotbugs checks are included in the Apache Maven `verify` step.
Run the spotbugs analysis checks as part of the Apache Maven `verify` step with the command:

```
mvn clean -DskipTests verify
```

It is generally preferred to fix a spotbugs warning rather than suppress the warning message.
However, in those cases where a spotbugs message is incorrect or is infeasible to fix, it can be suppressed with the `SuppressFBWarnings` annotation.
A suppression might look like this:

```java
import edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.SuppressFBWarnings;
/* ... preceding a method that returns a Boolean and may return null */
    @SuppressFBWarnings(
            value = "NP_BOOLEAN_RETURN_NULL",
            justification = "Null return indicates others should evaluate further")
```

== Add a spotbugs exclusions file (if needed)

Sometimes the number of spotbugs exclusions make it inconvenient or tedious to place the exclusions in the source files.
In those cases, a spotbugs exclusions file can be used to list the spotbugs warnings that are being excluded and the classes, methods, and fields involved.

A good example of the spotbugs exclusions file and its configuration is available from Jenkins core.
See the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/blob/master/src/spotbugs/excludesFilter.xml[src/spotbugs/excludesFilter.xml] source file for examples.
The exclusions in the filter file are enabled automatically with recent versions so long as the exclusion file is named `src/spotbugs/excludesFilter.xml`.

An example excludes filter file is also included here:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<FindBugsFilter>
  <!--
    Exclusions in this section have been triaged and determined to be
    false positives.
  -->

  <!--
    Here lies technical debt. Exclusions in this section have not yet
    been triaged. When working on this section, pick an exclusion to
    triage, then:

    - Add a @SuppressFBWarnings(value = "[...]", justification = "[...]")
      annotation if it is a false positive.  Indicate the reason why
      it is a false positive, then remove the exclusion from this
      section.

    - If it is not a false positive, fix the bug, then remove the
      exclusion from this section.
