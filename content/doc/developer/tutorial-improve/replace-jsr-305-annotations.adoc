# Replace JSR-305 annotations with Spotbugs annotations

Annotations for `Nonnull`, `CheckForNull`, and several others were proposed for Java as part of **dormant** link:https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=305[Java specification request JSR-305].
The proposal never became a part of standard Java.
Jenkins plugins should switch from using JSR-305 annotations to use Spotbugs annotations that provide the same semantics.

Refer to the link:https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-dev/c/uE1wwtVi1W0/m/gLxdEJmlBQAJ[mailing list discussion] from James Nord.

// Create the branch
include::doc/developer/tutorial-improve/_create-a-branch.adoc[]

## Migrate Nonnull

Replace imports of `javax.annotation.Nonnull` with imports of `edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.NonNull`.

Replace references to `Nonnull` with `NonNull`.

## Migrate CheckForNull

Replace imports of `javax.annotation.CheckForNull` with imports of `edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.CheckForNull`.

## Remove unused dependencies from pom file

If the pom file includes a `jsr305` dependency, remove it.
The spotbugs annotations are provided by the parent pom.

// Compile the plugin
include::doc/developer/tutorial-improve/_compile-the-plugin.adoc[]

Confirm that JSR-305 is not mentioned in the compiler output and that compilation succeeds.
