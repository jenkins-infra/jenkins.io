= Migrate documentation to GitHub

Jenkins plugin documentation was originally maintained on a wiki.
The wiki was deprecated in 2019 due to spam and was shut down in 2021.
Plugin documentation is migrating to GitHub.
Instructions are available on the link:/doc/developer/publishing/wiki-page/#migrating-from-wiki-to-github[www.jenkins.io] site.
