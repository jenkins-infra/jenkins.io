= Convert translations with native2ascii

Java property files provide localizations in the Jenkins project.
Unfortunately, in the past they had to use ISO-8859-1 encoding, even for files that needed to represent characters outside of ISO-8859-1.
Due to a risk of character set confusion when Jenkins reads the property files, Jenkins plugin tests will warn developers when existing property files include characters that are both valid UTF-8 and valid ISO-8859-1.
When that ambiguity is detected, those files should be encoded to assure they are read correctly.

When such a conversion is needed, the Maven build process will frequently output a message like:

[source]
----
[ERROR] PropertiesTestSuite$PropertiesTest Time elapsed: 0.001 s <<< FAILURE!
java.lang.AssertionError: file:config_ja.properties is valid UTF-8 and
valid ISO-8859-1. To avoid problems when auto-detecting the encoding,
use the lowest common denominator of ASCII encoding and express
non-ASCII characters with escape sequences using a tool like
`native2ascii`.
----

== Compile and test to check conversion is needed

Compile the plugin (with a recent parent pom) and confirm that the encoding warning message is displayed:

[source,bash]
----
mvn -ntp clean verify
[ERROR] PropertiesTestSuite$PropertiesTest Time elapsed: 0.001 s <<< FAILURE!
java.lang.AssertionError: file:config_ja.properties is valid UTF-8 and
valid ISO-8859-1. To avoid problems when auto-detecting the encoding,
use the lowest common denominator of ASCII encoding and express
non-ASCII characters with escape sequences using a tool like
`native2ascii`.
----

If the warning message is not displayed and the plugin is using the most recent parent pom, then no conversion is necessary.

== Convert the files with native2ascii

If the warning message is displayed,  use `native2ascii` to convert the files.
Use the specific files mentioned in the warning message in place of the `.../config_ja.properties` file in the sample below:

[source,bash]
----
native2ascii .../config_ja.properties x
mv x .../config_ja.properties
----

Review the change that native2ascii performed with the command:

[source,bash]
----
git diff
diff --git a/.../config_ja.properties b/.../config_ja.properties
index 83e3576..e661ac9 100644
