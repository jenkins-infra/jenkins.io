= Add a contributing guide

If the plugin does not already include a contributing guide and if it would benefit from more detail than is provided in the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md[default contributing guide], add a contributing guide so that others understand how to help with plugin development.
Look for existing contributing instructions in files like `README.md`.
Move the content from the `README.md` file to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file so that the README file stays focused on user documentation.

// Create the branch
include::doc/developer/tutorial-improve/_create-a-branch.adoc[]

The contributing guide often includes instructions to:

* Compile and run automated tests
* Run the plugin in a development environment
* Report code coverage of the plugin and its tests
* Report static analysis results

Refer to the contributing guides of other plugins for common examples, like:

* link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md[Jenkins GitHub organization contributing guide]
* link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md[Configuration as code plugin]
* link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md[Warnings Next Generation plugin]
