= Move plugin description to index.jelly

To help administrators decide if a plugin is relevant for them, each plugin should provide a short description which is then shown in plugin manager and on the plugin site.
The preferred location for the plugin description is in the file `src/main/resources/index.jelly`.
In the past it was also possible to provide it using the `description` tag in plugin POM, but
recent versions of the parent POM require the preferred location and will fail to compile if the plugin description is not available from `index.jelly` in the expected directory.

Copy the contents of the `description` tag from the POM file to `src/main/resources/index.jelly`.

NOTE: Some plugins do not currently provide description at all or use description copied from the `hello-world` sample plugin. For such plugins you have to write the description yourself. Such plugins are listed in jira:JENKINS-68300[].

When such a conversion is needed, the Maven build process will frequently output a message like:

[source]
----
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal maven-hpi-plugin:hpi (default-hpi) on
project your-plugin: Missing target/classes/index.jelly. Delete any
<description> from pom.xml and create src/main/resources/index.jelly:
----

// Create the branch
include::doc/developer/tutorial-improve/_create-a-branch.adoc[]

// Compile the plugin
include::doc/developer/tutorial-improve/_compile-the-plugin.adoc[]

Confirm that the description transition warning message is displayed:

[source,bash]
----

project your-plugin: Missing target/classes/index.jelly. Delete any
<description> from pom.xml and create src/main/resources/index.jelly:
----

If the warning message is not displayed and the plugin is using the most recent parent pom, then no transition is necessary.

== Move description to src/main/resources/index.jelly

Remove the `<description>` tag and its value from the POM.
Create the `src/main/resources/index.jelly` file and insert the description as follows:

[source,xml]
----
<?jelly escape-by-default='true'?>
<div>
Insert your plugin description here
</div>
----

Review the change with the command:

[source,bash]
----
git diff
diff --git a/src/main/resources/index.jelly b/src/main/resources/index.jelly
new file mode 100644
