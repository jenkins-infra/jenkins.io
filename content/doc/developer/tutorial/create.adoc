- link:../extend[Step 4: Extend the Plugin]

After link:../prepare[preparing your environment], the next step is to create a new plugin.

NOTE: If your intention is to publish your plugin on the Jenkins update site, now is a good time to look for plugins that already do something similar.
See link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Before+starting+a+new+plugin[this wiki page] for more information.

== Create the Project Layout with Sample Plugin Archetype

Open a command prompt, navigate to the directory you want to store your new Jenkins plugin in, and run the following command:

[source]
mvn -U archetype:generate -Dfilter="io.jenkins.archetypes:"

This command will let you generate one of several project archetypes related to Jenkins.
In this tutorial we're going to use the `hello-world` archetype, version 1.4, so select that:

// https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#applying-substitutions
[source,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
$ mvn -U archetype:generate -Dfilter="io.jenkins.archetypes:"
…
Choose archetype:
1: remote -> io.jenkins.archetypes:empty-plugin (Skeleton of a Jenkins plugin with a POM and an empty source tree.)
2: remote -> io.jenkins.archetypes:global-configuration-plugin (Skeleton of a Jenkins plugin with a POM and an example piece of global configuration.)
3: remote -> io.jenkins.archetypes:global-shared-library (Uses the Jenkins Pipeline Unit mock library to test the usage of a Global Shared Library)
4: remote -> io.jenkins.archetypes:hello-world-plugin (Skeleton of a Jenkins plugin with a POM and an example build step.)
5: remote -> io.jenkins.archetypes:scripted-pipeline (Uses the Jenkins Pipeline Unit mock library to test the logic inside a Pipeline script.)
Choose a number or apply filter (format: [groupId:]artifactId, case sensitive contains): : *4* // <1>
Choose io.jenkins.archetypes:hello-world-plugin version:
1: 1.1
2: 1.2
3: 1.3
4: 1.4
Choose a number: 4: *4* // <2>
…
[INFO] Using property: groupId = unused
Define value for property 'artifactId': *demo* // <3>
Define value for property 'version' 1.0-SNAPSHOT: : // <4>
[INFO] Using property: package = io.jenkins.plugins.sample
Confirm properties configuration:
groupId: unused
artifactId: demo
version: 1.0-SNAPSHOT
package: io.jenkins.plugins.sample
 Y: : *y* // <5>

----
<1> Enter the number for the `hello-world-plugin` archetype, *4* in this case.
<2> This tutorial is based on version 1.4 of the *hello-world-plugin* archetype, so enter *4* to select it.
<3> This is mandatory and uniquely identifies your plugin in Jenkins.
    This plugin tutorial uses the name `demo` (user input highlighted in bold).
    If you want to publish your plugin, make sure the name is not already taken, and that the name you choose is future-proof:
    the `artifactId` cannot be changed after you've published your first release.
    Do _not_ use the words `jenkins` or `plugin` in this ID—only the words describing what kind of Jenkins plugin this is.
<4> There's no need to choose a different version number here. This is the development version (indicated by `SNAPSHOT`) of version 1.0.
    link:https://stackoverflow.com/q/5901378[Learn more about Maven version numbers.]
<5> After you enter all the values, Maven will show them again. Review and confirm your selection.

This creates a directory with the same name as the plugin’s `artifactId` (`demo` in this case),
and adds the basic structure for a working plugin.
Let’s make sure we can build the plugin:

[listing]
----
$ mv demo demo-plugin // <1>
$ cd demo-plugin
$ mvn verify
----
<1> Maven has created the project structure in a directory with the same name as you chose for your plugin.
    We will rename the directory to match the conventional repository names used in the GitHub organization `@jenkinsci`.

Maven will download several more dependencies, and then go through the configured build lifecycle, including static analysis (FindBugs) and tests, until it shows something like this:

[listing]
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time:  01:35 min
[INFO] Finished at: 2018-11-21T12:31:58+08:00

Not the output you're seeing? See the <<Troubleshooting>> section below.

Let's link:../run[run the plugin] and see what it does.
