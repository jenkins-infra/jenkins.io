The Maven HPI Plugin provides a convenient way to run a Jenkins instance with your plugin:

[listing]
mvn hpi:run

This will set up a Jenkins instance on `http://localhost:8080/jenkins`. Wait for the following console output, then open a web browser and look at what the plugin does.

[listing]
INFO: Jenkins is fully up and running

NOTE: The Jenkins home directory used is the `work/` directory in the plugin directory. This means that subsequent runs will keep their data.

Create a new freestyle project in Jenkins, and add the "Say hello world" build step. It will look like this:

image::developer/tutorial/job-config.png[Freestyle job configuration]

Enter a name, save the project, and start a new build. The build step will print a message to the build log, like this:

[listing]
Started by user anonymous
Building in workspace /Users/mrjenkins/demo/work/workspace/testjob
Hello, Jenkins!
Finished: SUCCESS

Additionally, the build step has global configuration options. Go to _Manage Jenkins Â» Configure System_ and you'll see this:

image::developer/tutorial/system-config.png[System configuration]

Let's stop Jenkins by pressing +Ctrl-C+ (or your system's equivalent) in the terminal.

Next step: link:../extend[Extend the plugin].
