== Download and install a JDK

// TIMEBASED
Jenkins is based on Java, so to build Jenkins plugins you need to install a Java Development Kit (JDK).
Recent Jenkins releases require JDK 8 to run, so that's what we're using in this tutorial.

You can download and install JDK 8 from link:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/[the Oracle website].

NOTE: Many Linux distributions provide packages for Oracle JDK or OpenJDK JDK for an easier install and upgrade experience.
Consult your distribution's documentation for details.
To check if you have the JDK already installed, run `java -version` on a command prompt.

== Download and install Maven

Jenkins plugins mostly use Maven to build, so that's what we're going to use in this tutorial.

Download Maven from link:https://maven.apache.org[Apache Maven website]. 
Make sure to download one of the binary files (with `bin` in their name). 


// TODO: Include subsections for every OS
NOTE: Many Linux distributions provide packages for Maven for an easier install and upgrade experience.
Consult your distribution's documentation for details.
On macOS, the link:https://brew.sh/[Homebrew] package manager offers Maven packages.
Make sure a recent version of Maven 3, ideally 3.3.9 or newer, is provided if you decide to go this route.
// TIMEBASED

Extract Maven, and take note of its location. Then, add the the full path of the `bin/` subdirectory extracted (for example, `~/Applications/apache-maven/bin/mvn` or `C:\Program files\Maven\bin\mvn`) to the `PATH` variable in your OS. (This will let you invoke Maven using `mvn`).

The rest of the tutorial assumes that Maven is on your `PATH`, but you can also just type the full path.

To verify that Maven is installed, run the following command:

[listing]
mvn -version

This command prints some diagnostic output, including the versions of Java and Maven, and which Java installation was found by Maven.
It should indicate a _1.8_ version of Java, and list the path to the JDK.
If you don't see this information, see <<Troubleshooting>>.

== Setting up a productive environment with your IDE
===   NetBeans

NetBeans users can use the IDE's Maven support to open the project directly.

As you navigate through the code, you can tell NetBeans to attach source code JAR files by clicking the "Attach" button that appears in the top of the main content window. This allows you to read the Jenkins core source code as you develop plugins. (Or just select Download Sources on the Dependencies node.)

You are advised to use the  https://github.com/stapler/netbeans-stapler-plugin[ NetBeans plugin for Jenkins/Stapler development]. This offers many Jenkins-specific features. Most visibly, create a new plugin using New Project » Maven » Jenkins Plugin, and use Run project to test it.

=== IntelliJ IDEA
IntelliJ 7.0 (or later) users can load pom.xml directly from IDE, and you should see all the source code of libraries and Jenkins core all the way to the bottom. Consider installing the IntelliJ IDEA plugin for Stapler to make the development easier.

Alternatively, create a new Maven project using **Create from archetype** and **Add an Archetype**. Select the GroupId and ArtifactId as above, and choose RELEASE as version. On the next screen, select io.jenkins.plugins as groupID and choose an artifactId (Project name) and Version to your liking. This will automatically create a maven project based on the specified artifact (for example, empty-plugin).

NOTE: IntelliJ defaults to downloading sources and JavaDocs on demand. So, to see the source, you may need to click the Download artifacts button in the Maven Projects tab.

=== Eclipse
Use Eclipse Juno (4.2) or later for the best experience.

NOTE: Eclipse versions between 4.5 and < 4.6.2 contain a bug that causes errors such as "Only a type can be imported. hudson.model.Job resolves to a package".
If you encounter this error please upgrade to Eclipse Neon.2 (4.6.2) or higher (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=495598[Bug 495598]).

As Jenkins plugins are Maven projects, Eclipse users have two ways to load a Jenkins plugin project:

* You can use link:https://www.eclipse.org/m2e/[M2Eclipse] (m2e), which tries to make Eclipse understand Maven "natively".
* You can use  link:http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-eclipse-plugin/[Maven Eclipse plugin], which makes Maven generate Eclipse project definitions. 

At the moment, unless you have some prior experience with m2e, we recommend plugin developers to use the Maven Eclipse plugin.

Eclipse users can run the following Maven command to generate Eclipse project files (the custom `outputDirectory` parameter is used to work around the lack of JSR-269 annotation processor support in Eclipse:)

[listing]
$ mvn -DdownloadSources=true -DdownloadJavadocs=true -DoutputDirectory=target/eclipse-classes -Declipse.workspace=/path/to/workspace eclipse:eclipse eclipse:configure-workspace

Where /path/to/workspace is the path to your Eclipse workspace.

After this command completes successfully, use "Import..." (under the File menu in Eclipse) and select "General" > "Existing Projects into Workspace".

NOTE: Do not select "Existing Maven Projects", which takes you to the m2e route.

See https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+plugin+development+with+Eclipse[Jenkins plugin development with Eclipse] for gotchas and other known Eclipse/Maven related issues with Jenkins plugin development.

See https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Eclipse+alternative+build+setup[Eclipse alternative build setup] for an alternative way of setting up the Eclipse build environment, that is a bit more technically involved than using Maven but can give faster build times.
