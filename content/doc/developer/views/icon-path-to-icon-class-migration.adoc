title: Icon path to icon class migration
layout: developer
---

Jenkins core has removed `GIF` and `PNG` icons as of Jenkins v2.333, in favor of the previously added SVG icons.

Plugins, that don't interact with icons at all, are unaffected by this change.

== Examples of area which require changes

* If a plugin reads icons from its icon path, it typically does the following in jelly:

[source, xml]
----
<img src="${imagesURL}/16x16/fingerprint.png" alt="" height="16" width="16" />
<!-- or -->
<l:task icon="images/24x24/document.png" href="" title="${%Modules}" />
----

* or in groovy:

[source, groovy]
----
img(width:"16", height:"16", src:"${imagesURL}/16x16/next.gif")
----

* A plugin can do that in Java too, but that is, by far, less common.

== Maintaining support for legacy icons and modern icons

Jelly offers a couple of properties to access an icon class instead of an icon path. Jenkins core will display a GIF, a PNG or an SVG, based on the Jenkins version used. The properties `<l:icon class>` and `<l:task icon>` are used based on the location the icon is displayed in.

The format is `icon-<icon> icon-<size>`. `<icon>` represents the name of the icon that used to be read from a path.
`<size>` represents the icon size.
The following values for `<size>` are available:
[options="header"]
|=======================
|Path size attribute|`<size>` attribute
|16x16    |sm
|24x24    |md
|32x32    |lg
|48x48    |xlg
|=======================

Pick the appropriate `<size>` attribute according to the path size the icon has.

Jelly example:
[source, xml]
----
<l:icon class="icon-fingerprint icon-sm" />
<!-- or -->
<l:task icon="icon-document icon-md" href="" title="${%Modules}" />
----

Groovy example:
[source, groovy]
----
l.task(icon:"icon-next icon-sm")
----
