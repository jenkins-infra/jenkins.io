title: Icon path to icon class migration
layout: developerguide
---

Jenkins core has removed `GIF` and `PNG` icons as of Jenkins v2.333, in favor of the previously added SVG icons.

Plugins, that don't interact with icons at all, are unaffected by this change.

== Examples of area which require changes

* If a plugin reads icons from its icon path, it typically does the following in jelly:

[source, xml]
----
<img src="${imagesURL}/16x16/fingerprint.png" alt="" height="16" width="16" />
<!-- or -->
<l:task icon="images/24x24/document.png" href="" title="${%Modules}" />
----

* or in groovy:

[source, groovy]
----
img(width:"16", height:"16", src:"${imagesURL}/16x16/next.gif")
----

* A plugin can do that in Java too, but that is, by far, less common.

== Maintaining support for legacy icons and modern icons

Jelly offers a couple of properties to access an icon class instead of an icon path. Jenkins core will display a GIF, a PNG or an SVG, based on the Jenkins version used. The properties `<l:icon class>` and `<l:task icon>` are used based on the location the icon is displayed in.

Jelly example:
[source, xml]
----
<l:task icon="icon-gear2 icon-md" href="${rootURL}/manage" title="${%Manage Jenkins}" />
<!-- or -->
<l:icon class="icon-gear2 icon-md" />
----

Groovy example:
[source, groovy]
----
l.task(icon:"icon-gear2 icon-md", href:"${rootURL}/manage", title:_("Manage Jenkins"))
----
