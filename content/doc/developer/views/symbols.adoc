Jenkins Symbols are an extensive and consistent collection of icons for use in Jenkins and plugins.
Symbols are intended to be used everywhere a traditional icon would be used, such as in the sidebar,
in buttons and in tables. Symbols are scalable, support different weights and adapt to the user's theme.

=== Using Symbols

Using symbols in your view is simple. Use the existing `icon` component and set the `src`
value to the symbol you want, prefixed with `"symbol-"`.

*Jelly example:*
[source, xml]
----
<l:icon src="symbol-search" />
----

*Groovy example:*
[source, groovy]
----
l.icon(src: 'symbol-search')
----

It's possible to add alt text and custom classes to symbols, for example:

*Jelly example:*
[source, xml]
----
<l:icon src="symbol-search" alt="Search" class="custom-class" />
----

*Groovy example:*
[source, groovy]
----
l.icon(src: 'symbol-search', alt: 'Search', class: 'custom-class')
----

[.docs__version]#Coming soon#

As a plugin developer, you'll soon be able to add your own symbols for use in your plugin for when
there isn't an appropriate existing symbol to use.
