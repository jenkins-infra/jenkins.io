title: Table to div layout migration
layout: developerguide
---

NOTE: This is documentation for a new feature in Jenkins core.
See jira:JENKINS-56109[Change Jenkins configuration UI from tables to divs] for details.

Jenkins core changed its form layout from ``<table>`` to ``<div>`` in 2.264 (weekly) and 2.277.1 (LTS).
Jenkins 2.263.x (LTS) releases did *not* change their form layout from ``<table>`` to ``<div>``.

All core ``taglib``s and views were updated in link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/3895[jenkinsci/jenkins#3895] as part of jira:JENKINS-56109[].

The vast majority of plugins do not require any changes at all because they use the standard Jelly tags in Jenkins for their forms, such as ``<f:entry>``, ``<f:textbox>``, and ``<f:checkbox>``.

== Debugging

If you are experiencing configuration form problems (e.g., form controls not working, the save button not working, etc.):

. Verify that you followed the instructions in the link:/doc/upgrade-guide/2.277/#upgrading-to-jenkins-lts-2-277-1[Jenkins 2.277.1 upgrade guide], including updating plugins after installing Jenkins 2.277.1.
. Refer to the link:https://issues.jenkins.io/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=20741[known broken plugins dashboard]; if you are using a plugin that is known to be broken, disable it and upvote the issue.
. Disable any plugins that are no longer in use, particularly if those plugins are https://github.com/jenkins-infra/update-center2/blob/master/resources/artifact-ignores.properties[no longer distributed on the Jenkins update site] (including Team Foundation Server and Perforce).

=== Identifying the broken plugin

If the problem persists, perform bisection to identify the broken plugin.

. If you are uncomfortable using your production Jenkins installation, set up a minimal Jenkins installation:
+
[source,bash]
----
JENKINS_HOST=username:password@myhost.com:port
curl -sSL "http://$JENKINS_HOST/pluginManager/api/xml?depth=1&xpath=/*/*/shortName|/*/*/version&wrapper=plugins" | perl -pe 's/.*?<shortName>([\w-]+).*?<version>([^<]+)()(<\/\w+>)+/\1 \2\n/g'| sed 's/ /:/' | cut -d ':' -f 1 | sort > plugins.txt
wget https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool/releases/download/2.9.0/jenkins-plugin-manager-2.9.0.jar
wget https://get.jenkins.io/war-stable/2.277.1/jenkins.war
export JENKINS_HOME=~/.jenkins-tables-to-div
java -jar jenkins-plugin-manager-2.9.0.jar -f plugins.txt -d $JENKINS_HOME/plugins --war jenkins.war
java -jar jenkins.war
----
. Create a "freestyle" job to reproduce the issue.
. Generally disable plugins in groups of 10, recording which plugins you have disabled.
. Restart Jenkins.
. If the problem persists, keep disabling plugins.
. Once the problem is resolved, enable plugins one at a time to identify the broken plugin.

=== Reporting issues

When reporting an issue, include the following information:

. Provide the _complete_ list of installed plugins as suggested in the link:/doc/book/system-administration/diagnosing-errors/#how-to-report-a-bug[bug reporting guidelines].
. Provide a screenshot.
. Provide steps to reproduce the problem on a minimal Jenkins installation; the scenario should fail when the broken plugin is enabled and pass when the broken plugin is disabled.
. Use the `tables-to-divs-regression` label.

== Examples of area which may require changes

Below are some areas that may require you to adjust the form layout or JavaScript in your plugin:

* Adding `td` / `tr` elements directly instead of using the `f:entry` tag, e.g. link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/config-rotator-plugin/pull/2[config-rotator-plugin#2]

* Custom JavaScript that is brittle to the Jenkins form UI layout. Weâ€™ve done our best to introduce shims, to not cause breakage here, 
but if you have written JavaScript that is reliant on the DOM structure you may need to make adjustments,
take a look at the JavaScript link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/3895[changes in jenkins#3895].

* Forking jelly taglibs from core and extending them, e.g. link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/multiple-scms-plugin/pull/25[multiple-scms-plugin#25],
it would be good to contribute fixes or enhancements to core rather than doing this where possible.

* Using tables in the plugin for layout, e.g. link:https://github.com/jfrog/jenkins-artifactory-plugin/pull/266[jenkins-artifactory-plugin#266] and link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/matrix-auth-plugin/pull/83[matrix-auth-plugin#83].


== Maintaining support for tables and div layout

Maintaining such support is preferred where it is easily possible, to allow plugins to be updated and used
on Jenkins deployments with older core versions (including current LTS 2.263.x at the time of this writing).

There is a jelly property set on Jenkins instances that use div's for form layout called `divBasedFormLayout`,
so you can adapt your plugin UI based on the presence of this property.

_Note: This property is only set if the form tag uses the `f:form` jelly tag, and not the HTML `form` tag,
this will be done automatically for you in form sections but not in actions or custom views._

Jelly example:

[source,xml]
----
<j:jelly xmlns:j="jelly:core" xmlns:d="jelly:define" xmlns:local="local">
  <d:taglib uri="local">
    <d:tag name="blockWrapper">
          <j:choose>
              <j:when test="${divBasedFormLayout}">
                  <div>
                      <d:invokeBody/>
                  </div>
              </j:when>
              <j:otherwise>
                  <table style="width:100%">
                      <d:invokeBody/>
                  </table>
              </j:otherwise>
          </j:choose> 
      </d:tag>
  </d:taglib>

  <local:blockWrapper>
  ...
  </local:blockWrapper>
</j:jelly>
----

This will use a table on Jenkins instances that don't have `divBasedFormLayout` and will use a div when it is set.

_Note: You will likely need more tags to adapt the `tr` and `td` tags to divs see link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/multiple-scms-plugin/pull/25[multiple-scms-plugin#25] for a full example, or link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/notification-plugin/pull/40/files[notification-plugin#40] for an even more extensive example of different wrapper types (note they are shipped in separate files, included from the jelly files to edit with references like `xmlns:p="/lib/notification"` with a path part relative to `src/main/resources/` directory)._

Groovy example:

[source,groovy]
----
blockWrapper {
    p('Hello, World!')
}

def blockWrapper(Closure closure) {
    if (context.getVariableWithDefaultValue("divBasedFormLayout", false) == true) {
        div() {
            closure.call()
        }
    } else {
        table(style: "width: 100%") {
            closure.call()
        }
    }
}
