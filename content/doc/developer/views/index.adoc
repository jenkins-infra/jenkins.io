## Debugging Tips and Tricks

The following static fields can be set to `true` (e.g. via Script Console) while Jenkins is running to enable various debugging aids:

`org.kohsuke.stapler.jelly.JellyFacet.TRACE`::
Jelly will emit XML comments that help understand Jelly view composition from fragments.
This can help understand how a view is composed.
The corresponding Java system property is link:/doc/book/managing/system-properties/#stapler-jelly-trace[`stapler.jelly.trace`].

NOTE: Support for Jelly tracing is broken in Jenkins 2.287 and earlier (https://issue-redirect.jenkins.io/issue/65288[JENKINS-65288]).
Some plugins with custom JavaScript may also have problems if this is set to `true`.

`org.kohsuke.stapler.jelly.ReallyStaticTagLibrary.EMIT_LOCATION`::
Jelly will emit `line` and `file` attributes on rendered HTML/XML tags.
This can help understand how a view is composed.
There is no corresponding Java system property.
