summary: How Jenkins uses the Stapler framework

== Request Handling

Jenkins classes are bound to URLs by using http://stapler.kohsuke.org[Stapler].
The singleton +jenkinsdoc:Jenkins[]+ instance is bound to the context root (most of the time "/") URL, and the rest of the objects are bound according to their reachability from this root object.
Stapler uses reflection to recursively determine how to process any given URL.
A few examples of how the URL `/foo/bar` could be processed:

* A `getFoo(String)` is defined on the `Jenkins` object, and Stapler passes `bar` as a parameter.
  The object returned has a method called `doIndex(â€¦)` that gets called and renders the response.
* `getFoo()` is defined and returns an object that has a `getBar` or `doBar` method.
  The object returned from that has an associated `index.jelly` or `index.groovy` view.
* `getFoo()` is are defined and the returned object has a view named `bar.jelly` or `bar.groovy` defined.
* `doFoo()` is defined.

A number of additional ways to handle requests exist, but these are the most common.

== Views

Jenkins' model objects have multiple _views_ that are used to render HTML pages about each object.
Views are written in http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/jelly/[Jelly] or http://groovy-lang.org/[Groovy] and can be composed of a number of different partial views (or view fragments).
