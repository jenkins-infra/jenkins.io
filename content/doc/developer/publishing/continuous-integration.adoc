title: Continuous Integration - buildPlugin
layout: developersection
---

The Jenkins project runs its own Jenkins instance for CI builds on link:https://ci.jenkins.io/[ci.jenkins.io].
It will build all plugin repositories in the `jenkinsci` organization that have a `Jenkinsfile` in the root of the repository.

The typical plugin build (Maven or Gradle) can be run by just having the following statement in the `Jenkinsfile`:

[source]
----
buildPlugin(
  useContainerAgent: true, // Set to `false` if you need to use Docker for containerized tests
  configurations: [
    [platform: 'linux', jdk: 17],
    [platform: 'windows', jdk: 11],
])
----

'Gradle support in `buildPlugin()` is deprecated and will be eventually removed. Please use:'

[source]
----
buildPluginWithGradle(
  useContainerAgent: true, // Set to `false` if you need to use Docker for containerized tests
  configurations: [
    [platform: 'linux', jdk: 17],
    [platform: 'windows', jdk: 11],
])
----

NOTE: If the `Jenkinsfile` configuration includes Java 8, you will receive a low-level class version error when using version 4.52 or later of the plugin parent POM.
