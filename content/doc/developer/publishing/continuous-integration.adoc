The Jenkins project runs its own Jenkins instance for CI builds on link:https://ci.jenkins.io/[ci.jenkins.io].
It will build all plugin repositories in the `jenkinsci` organization that have a `Jenkinsfile` in the root of the repository.

The typical plugin build (Maven or Gradle) can be run by just having the following statement in the `Jenkinsfile`:
----
buildPlugin(useContainerAgent: true)
----

Gradle support in `buildPlugin()` is deprecated and will be eventually removed. Please use:
----
buildPluginWithGradle(useContainerAgent: true)
----

To learn more about the Pipeline library providing this functionality, see https://github.com/jenkins-infra/pipeline-library[its GitHub repository].
