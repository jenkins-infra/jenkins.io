title: Guide to Plugin Hosting
layout: developer

This guide will cover the entire plugin hosting process.

Once you've completed all steps described on this page you will have accomplished the following:

* Your plugin source code will be hosted in a repository in the `jenkinsci` GitHub organization.
  You will have admin access to this repository.
* You will be allowed to release the plugin to the Jenkins project Maven repository, which serves as a source for the Jenkins project operated update sites.

== Preparation

Complete the following steps before requesting plugin hosting with the Jenkins project:

. Review the link:../preparation[preparation steps] and make sure they're satisfied.
. Make sure your plugin follows the plugin naming convention outlined in the link:../style-guides[style guides].
. Have a public repository containing the plugin source code on GitHub.


== Open Hosting request

[NOTE]
Our automated process makes it much easier to fork + delete (see below), rather than transfer repository ownership.
If your repository already has a significant number of forks, issues, pull requests, or other auxiliary data, we can manually transfer it -- just request so in the hosting request, and provide an explanation.

Log in to link:https://github.com/[GitHub] and create a new issue link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/repository-permissions-updater/issues/new?assignees=&labels=hosting-request&template=1-hosting-request.yml[in the repository-permissions-updater] repository.
Make sure to fill out all fields as described.

A member of the link:/project/teams/hosting[Hosting team] will review your request within a few days.
If any changes are requested, please implement them.

Once all requirements have been satisfied, your repository will be forked into the `jenkinsci` organization and you will be invited to join it.

At this point, you're asked to delete your repository we forked from.
You can recreate it afterwards by forking from `jenkinsci` again.
This will ensure that the `jenkinsci` repository is the root of the network graph on GitHub.
This means:

- There will be no confusion which repository is the canonical one.
- https://help.github.com/articles/searching-in-forks/[Source code search] will succeed even without a significant number of watchers on GitHub.
- Others are more likely to file pull requests in the `jenkinsci` repository (which is ideal for collaboration).

== Enable CI Builds

The Jenkins project hosts a Jenkins controller to perform continuous integration builds for plugins.
We recommend you set up CI builds for your plugin in the `jenkinsci` GitHub organization by creating a `Jenkinsfile` in your plugin's GitHub repository.
See link:../continuous-integration[the documentation for CI builds] for details how to do this.


== Request Upload Permissions

After your plugin source code has been forked into the `jenkinsci` organization, a pull request will be created for you that adds release permissions, if this doesn't happen you may need to create the request yourself.
link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/repository-permissions-updater/[Follow the instructions in the README of this repository] to do that.

Once you've completed this step and your request has been merged, you will be able to link:../releasing/[release your plugin].
See that guide for release instructions.

Alternately, you can configure your plugin to be released automatically whenever interesting changes are pushed, or on demand.
In this case you only need write permission to GitHub; you never need local credentials.
Follow link:/redirect/continuous-delivery-of-plugins[this guide] for details.

== Categorize the Plugin

Jenkins shows plugins in categories in the plugin manager and on the link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/[plugins site].
The link:../documentation[plugin documentation guide] includes instructions for link:../documentation#documenting-plugins[documenting], categorizing, and link:../documentation#labeling-plugins[labeling] plugins.

== Integrate with Jira

If your chosen issue tracker is Jira, you can setup autolink references, to link from commits directly to the Jenkins Jira issue.
All you need to do is heading to the `Settings` tab of your GitHub repository and add the following configuration to the `Autolink references` section:
```txt
Numeric
Reference prefix: JENKINS-
Target URL: https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-<num>
```
Commits prefixed with `JENKINS-<num>` will now be linked to the corresponding Jira issue:

== Join the community

As a new plugin author, its highly recommended that you join the link:/mailing-lists/[mailing list] to interact with the community and to stay up to date with the latest Jenkins news.

[NOTE]
====
Kindly refrain from asking questions or communicating in private channels.
We want the communications to take place in an open environment, so that we can have healthier discussions within our community.
