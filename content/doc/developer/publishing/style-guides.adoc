== Plugin Naming Convention

NOTE: Not all existing plugins may follow these rules, as those were established or enforced later.

=== Artifact ID

A plugin's artifact ID is used as the file base name and to uniquely identify the plugin in Jenkins and on update sites.
It needs to follow some conventions to be published:

* Use a lowercase ID, and separate terms with hyphens as needed.
* Include neither `jenkins` or `plugin` in the ID unless necessary for the name to make any sense at all.

For example, use `snapchat-notification` instead of `JenkinsSnapchatNotificationPlugin` or `notification-plugin-for-snapchat`.

The ID cannot be changed after the first release; Jenkins would consider it a different plugin.

=== Name

A plugin's name is shown to users on the Jenkins UI and elsewhere, such as the plugin site.
If is recommended to use a short and descriptive name, like _Subversion_.

Including _Jenkins_ or _Plugin_ in the name to indicate that it is a plugin for Jenkins is redundant and discouraged, and these terms may be stripped from the name in some cases to ensure consistency in lists, and to shorten the name.

=== Group ID

All new hosting requests are instructed to use `io.jenkins.plugins` as group ID. +
We do not strictly prohibit other group IDs unless they're in bad faith (e.g. referencing an organization you have no relationship with), but we strongly recommend using `io.jenkins.plugins` to avoid confusion and use a standardized pattern.

== Java Source Code

The Jenkins project generally follows the link:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconvtoc-136057.html[Oracle Java Code Convention] but it's not well enforced even in core components.
Individual plugin maintainers sometimes choose to use different style guides for their plugins.


== Commit Messages

Git commit messages should start with a reference to the Jira issue they're related to, if applicable, followed by a short summary on the first line, and more details on subsequent lines.
Example:

----
[JENKINS-00000] Frobnicate the widget
----

If a given commit _fixes_ the specified issue, use of one of the following prefixes will make an automated infra process resolve the related Jira issue.

----
[FIX JENKINS-00000] Frobnicate the widget
[FIXED JENKINS-00000] Frobnicate the widget
[FIXES JENKINS-00000] Frobnicate the widget
----
