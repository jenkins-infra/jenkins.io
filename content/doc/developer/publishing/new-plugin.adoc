[NOTE]
Please read link:../preparation[this guide] before you start if you intend to release your plugin publicly using the Jenkins project infrastructure.

== Use the archetype

We publish project archetypes, including an "empty plugin" one, that allow you to easily set up a minimal plugin project with recommended defaults.
Just run the following command on the command line (with Maven and JDK installed, see link:../../tutorial[the tutorial]), and follow the interactive instructions:

----
mvn archetype:generate -Dfilter=io.jenkins.archetypes:empty-plugin
