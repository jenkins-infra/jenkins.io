Some plugins may be replaced by others or just become irrelevant (e.g. integration with a service which was shut down).
We do not recommend deleting source code outright, even a stale or no-longer-relevant code can still be educational.
However, we do have a mechanism for deprecating or hiding plugins in the Jenkins update centers.
This page describes the process.

== Deprecating a plugin

. Set a `deprecated` label for the plugin. It can be done in 2 ways:
** Put a `deprecated` topic in the plugin's GitHub repository.
   If you have multiple plugins inside a single repository, it will apply to all of them
** Add a `deprecated` label to the plugin entry in the Update Center's link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/update-center2/blob/master/resources/label-definitions.properties[label-definitions.properties] file
. Update the plugin's documentation to explain the reason of the deprecation
. Release the plugin and put the deprecation notice into the changelog

== Removing a plugin from Update Centers

. Deprecate the plugin as documented above
. Submit a pull request to the Update Center's https://github.com/jenkins-infra/update-center2/blob/master/resources/artifact-ignores.properties[artifact-ignores.properties] file
. Archive the plugin's repository
** If you have admin permissions in the repository, it is possible to do it from the GitHub's web interface
** Otherwise, create a link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/[Jenkins Jira] ticket to archive the plugin's repository (project: `INFRA`, component: `github`)

== Reverting deprecation/removal

If required, it is possible to revert all the actions above.
A Jenkins Jira ticket is required to unarchive a plugin,
but the rest can be done via pull requests to the respective update center files mentioned above.
