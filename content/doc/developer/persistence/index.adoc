Jenkins uses the file system to store its data. Directories are created inside +$JENKINS_HOME+ in a way that models the object model structure. Some data, like console output, are stored just as plain text file, some are stored as Java property files. But the majority of the structured data, such as how a project is configured, or various records of the build, are persisted by using XStream.

This allows object state to be persisted relatively easily (including those from plugins), but one must pay attention to what's serialized in XML, and take measures to preserve backward compatibility. For example, in various parts of Jenkins you see the +transient+ keyword (which instructs XStream not to bind the field to XML), fields left strictly for backward compatibility, or re-construction of in-memory data structure after data is loaded.
