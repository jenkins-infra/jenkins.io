title: Backward Compatibility with XStream
summary: How to make object model changes with XStream while preserving backward compatibility.

== Add a new field

Persistence is XML-based,
and when the data is read back from disk and the XML does not contain data for a particular field,
the existing field value is left as-is.
"As-is" normally means the JVM default value (0, `false`, `null`, etc.),
because the persistence logic does not invoke your constructor to create your object as Java serialization would.

There are a few exceptions to this, where objects first create themselves and then load XML onto themselves.
These include https://javadoc.jenkins.io/jenkins/model/Jenkins.html[`Jenkins`] and https://javadoc.jenkins.io/hudson/model/Item.html[`Item`],
but these exceptions are limited to the root object of persistence.
In these exceptional cases, the values set in the constructor will survive.

If you want to fill in your field with a non-trivial default value,
you can write a `readResolve` method, which gets invoked right after your object is resurrected from persistence.
`readResolve` is called by XStream, but it is not part of the Jenkins class hierarchy, so there is no `@Override` annotation.
Just put it right in your class alongside your fields. For example:

[source,java]
----
protected Object readResolve() {
  if (gridBuilder == null) {
    if (selectedJob != null) {
      gridBuilder = new DownstreamProjectGridBuilder(selectedJob);
    }
  }
  return this;
}
----

If you need to force the _Manage Old Data_ screen to list jobs, builds, etc. using your data in the old format so that it can be saved in the new format in bulk,
you cannot use `readResolve`, since it will not notify this system of the problem.
Instead you must create a static nested class called `ConverterImpl` extending `XStream2.PassthruConverter`,
which should clean up the storage of your instance and finally call `OldDataMonitor#report` to record the conversion.

== Remove a field

Removing a field requires that you leave the field with the `transient` keyword.
When Jenkins reads the old XML, XStream will set the value for this field,
but it will no longer be written back to XML when data is saved.

== Rename a field

Renaming a field is a combination of the above:
mark your old field as `transient`, declare your new field, and then migrate the data from the old format to the new in your `readResolve` method:

[source,java]
----
protected transient Long myObjectId;
protected List<Long> myObjectIds;

protected Object readResolve() {
  if (myObjectId != null) {
   myObjectIds = Arrays.asList(myObjectId)
  }
  return this;
}
----

== Make a class abstract and introduce concrete subtypes

=== Before

* You decide to extend a class and create new choosable classes; for example, adding additional browsers to an SCM plugin.
* The old data structure looked like this when you had only one class `SCMBrowser`:
+
[source,xml]
----
<browser>
  <url>http://example.com/</url>
</browser>
----

=== After

* Now you decide to add a new `NewSCMBrowser`. All your `SCMBrowsers` extend `SCMBrowserBase` and your XML suddenly looks like this:
+
[source,xml]
----
<browser class="org.jenkinsci.plugins.foo.NewSCMBrowser">
  <url>http://example.com/</url>
</browser>
----
+
or
+
[source,xml]
----
<browser class="org.jenkinsci.plugins.foo.SCMBrowser">
  <url>http://example.com/</url>
</browser>
----

* With new jobs, no problem. Old jobs however will probably break.
* In your `SCMBrowserBase` class add a `readResolve` method (see the link:https://x-stream.github.io/faq.html[XStream FAQ]):
+
[source,java]
----
// compatibility with earlier plugins
public Object readResolve() {
  if (this.getClass() != SCMBrowserBase.class) {
    return this;
  }
  // make sure to return the default SCMBrowser only if we no class is given in config.
  try {
    return new SCMBrowser(url.toExternalForm());
  } catch (MalformedURLException e) {
    throw new RuntimeException(e);
  }
}
----

== Rename a class

Sometimes, you need to rename packages or class names.
If your serialization data includes a fully qualified class name (which happens, for example, if you have a collection of them),
then measures must be taken to maintain backward compatibility.

To do this, use `XSTREAM2#addCompatibilityAlias(String, Class)` to register aliases.
You need to do this against the right XStream instance,
as a few different instances are used to persist different parts of data.

`Items#XSTREAM2` is used for serializing project configuration,
and `Run#XSTREAM2` is used for serializing builds and their associated link:https://javadoc.jenkins.io/hudson/model/Action.html[`Action`]s.

For example, to alias `Foo` in the "old" package to the "updated" one,
you can use this method call:

[source,java]
----
Items.XSTREAM2.addCompatibilityAlias("org.acme.old.Foo", org.acme.updated.Foo.class);
----

To ensure your alias is registered early in the Jenkins boot sequence,
you can use the link:https://javadoc.jenkins.io/hudson/init/Initializer.html[`Initializer`] annotation on a static method, e.g. in your `DescriptorImpl`:

[source,java]
----
@Initializer(before = InitMilestone.PLUGINS_STARTED)
public static void addAliases() {
  Items.XSTREAM2.addCompatibilityAlias("org.acme.old.Foo", Foo.class);
}
----

== Rename or move the descriptor class of a plugin

Since 1.507 https://javadoc.jenkins.io/hudson/model/Descriptor.html#getConfigFile--[`Descriptor#getConfigFile`] is overridable and https://javadoc.jenkins.io/hudson/XmlFile.html[`XmlFile`] can be instantiated with any XStream instance.
