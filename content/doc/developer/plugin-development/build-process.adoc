Most Jenkins plugins are built with link:https://maven.apache.org[Maven].
They typically use the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-pom/[Jenkins plugin POM] as their parent link:https://maven.apache.org/pom.html[POM], which provides a sensible default configuration for the plugin build.
The link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/maven-hpi-plugin/[Maven HPI plugin] is one of the plugins configured there.
It does the heavy lifting, such as bundling plugins in the HPI/JPI archive format used for Jenkins plugins, or allowing developers to run a debug Jenkins instance with the plugin.

Since version 2.0 of the plugin POM, it's possible to specify the core version dependency of the parent POM independent of its version.footnote:1.x[Up to Jenkins 1.645, the plugin POM was kept in sync with Jenkins releases, so that the minimum required Jenkins version for a plugin determined the versions of the tools used to build the plugin. These versions should no longer be used.]
This allows plugins compatible with older Jenkins releases to benefit from fixes and improvements in the parent POM.
The link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-pom/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md[plugin POM changelog] provides more details.

== Keeping up to date

It is generally recommended to frequently update to a recent plugin parent POM for multiple reasons:

* Plugin developers and users benefit from bug fixes and improvements to the parent POM and the tools and libraries it specifies
* Additions to the default build like static code analysis and general tests aim to improve the overall quality of plugins.
// TODO Need a good reference for that before including it as example:
// For example, plugins depending on the plugins parent POM 1.637 (with maven-hpi-plugin 1.110) or newer will need to specify the <code>escape-by-default</code> in all Jelly files for the InjectedTest to pass. Plugins depending on older releases may have hidden XSS vulnerabilities.
* Recent versions of the tools (inherited from the parent plugins POM) allow developers to use more advanced tools like the https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-compat-tester[plugin compatibility tester] to determine whether their plugin is compatible with newest Jenkins releases.
