title: Plugin Release Tips
---

Before you release a plugin, you should exercise it in ways that you probably didn't try while you were developing. 
Walking through these steps yourself can save you a first round of bug reports from your users, and thus make your plugin higher quality and lower cost to deploy.

## Test with agents
Be sure to test the plugin with agent nodes running on remote machines before you release.

## Watch for exceptions in logs

Watch the Jenkins console (not just the build output) for exceptions. 

## Test with `java -jar jenkins.war` (not just hpi:run)

Just testing a plugin with `mvn hpi:run` is insufficient. It will not expose classloader issues.
Run Jenkins with `java -jar jenkins.war` and install your plugin into it.

## Test with real builds in a non-production server

Test a new plugin in a non-production clone of a production server, with the actual projects that the plugin will run on in production. 
Often plugin bugs are revealed by real data that weren't revealed by test data. 
Beware hubris! When you are testing a plugin and trying to simulate real-world usage, you have to restart Jenkins whenever you think you've got a release candidate. 
Doing this on a production server will aggravate users and make Jenkins look flaky.
