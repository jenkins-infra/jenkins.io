title: Choosing a Jenkins version to build against
---

Your plugin's POM controls which version of Jenkins it is building/testing against.

## Choosing a version

You need to balance compatibility and features:

* *Keeping the Jenkins version your plugin builds against low* will allow more users to install and use your plugin. 
In particular, the LTS Release Line is based on slightly older releases to provide a more stable experience for conservative users.
* *Building against recent Jenkins versions* allows you to use recently added core features and API from your plugin. 
You will also use that newer version for `mvn hpi:run`, so it may be easier to test your plugin with newer Jenkins releases. 
Additionally, since features are sometimes moved from core into plugins, depending on a more recent Jenkins version will make your plugin's dependencies on what used to be core features explicit, otherwise your plugin will not work.
* *Use at least the minimum version supported by the update center*, the supported update center versions can be found at link:https://updates.jenkins.io[updates.jenkins.io], at the time of writing (2020-03) this is 2.164.x.

There are link:https://stats.jenkins.io/pluginversions/[statistics of core versions by plugin] that can help you decide.

These are updated monthly.

General tip: When upgrading, choose the link:https://jenkins.io/changelog-stable/[newest LTS version] that doesn't alienate the majority of users of your latest few releases (by requiring a newer Jenkins than they have).

## Changing the minimum required version

Set the `jenkins.version` property in `pom.xml` to the version you need to depend on.
