## Changes in Jenkins 2.138.4 and Jenkins 2.154

Web methods need to provide some indication that they are intended for Stapler routing:

* Any applicable annotation recognized by Stapler, e.g., `@RequirePOST`.
* Any inferable parameter type, e.g., `StaplerRequest`.
* Any applicable parameter annotation, recognized by Stapler, e.g., `@AncestorInPath`.
* Any declared exception type implementing `HttpResponse`, e.g., `HttpResponseException`.
* A return type implementing `HttpResponse`.

If none of these indicators are present, the method will no longer be invoked by Stapler as a web method starting in Jenkins 2.138.4 and Jenkins 2.154.
Some examples:

----
public void doRun()
public String doRun(String foo) throws Exception
----

When the SECURITY-595 fix prevents access to a URL, a warning message is written to the Jenkins log that looks similar to the following:

----
WARNING: New Stapler routing rules result in the URL "/example" no longer being allowed. If you consider it safe to use, add the following to the allowlist: "method hudson.model.Hudson doExample". Learn more: link:/redirect/stapler-routing
----

Administrators can follow the instructions to make the method or field work on their specific instance, but ideally the component is changed to prevent the problem in the first place:

* Add any of the indicators listed in the previous section that would make your method routable.
* Annotate the web method `@StaplerDispatchable`.
  You may need to add a dependency to the `io.jenkins.stapler:io.jenkins.stapler` library to make this annotation available.
