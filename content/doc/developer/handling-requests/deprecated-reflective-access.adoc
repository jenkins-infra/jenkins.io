title: Deprecated reflective access
layout: developersection
---

Before Jenkins 2.272 Stapler would access all fields ignoring visibility restrictions.

Stapler now tries to access a field first and only if it gets access denied then will it force access via javadoc:java.lang.reflect.AccessibleObject#setAccessible-boolean-[setAccessible(true)].

This behavior is not recommended anymore, and will trigger `IllegalReflectiveAccess` warnings when running Jenkins on Java 11.

If you see a warning message about this then you should link:/participate/report-issue/[report an issue] to the respective plugin.
