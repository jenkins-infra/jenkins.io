== Motivation

Jenkins uses the https://github.com/jenkinsci/stapler[Stapler web framework] to process HTTP requests, instead of a more common framework.
As a result, generic static analysis tools are often unable to find common vulnerabilities in Jenkins core and plugins.

To address this problem, the link:/security/team/[Jenkins security team] created a custom code scanner, built with GitHub's https://github.com/github/codeql[CodeQL], to find vulnerabilities commonly occurring in Jenkins plugins.

This page explains how to set up code scanning with this tool.

== Usage in a Jenkins project-hosted plugin

In your GitHub repository, select the "Actions" link on top.
If you already have some workflows in your repository, click "New Workflow".
In the section "By Jenkins", select "Jenkins Security Scan" and configure the YAML file in your repository.
Once saved, you should be able to see findings in the "Security" tab under "Code scanning alerts", and pull requests will have an additional check.

////
TODO Decide whether we want to continue to support this.
== Usage in a Jenkins project-hosted plugin (GitHub topic)

Add the topic `jenkins-security-scan-enabled` to your repository.
Within 24 hours, the first code scanning results should appear.
Unlike the GitHub Action, feedback is not immediate, as scans are only running periodically.
////

== Usage outside the Jenkins project

You can use the same GitHub workflow and action in your Jenkins plugin project hosted on GitHub even if it's outside the `jenkinsci` organization.
Just copy the YAML workflow template from https://github.com/jenkinsci/.github/tree/master/workflow-templates[`jenkinsci/.github`] into your repository's `.github/workflows` directory, replacing the `$default-branch` placeholder as appropriate.

NOTE: Your repository needs to be public or you need https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security[GitHub Advanced Security].
Otherwise, uploading the report to the repository's code scan reporting endpoint will fail with error 403 Forbidden.

== Feedback and Contributing

The custom GitHub workflow and actions are hosted in https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins-security-scan[`jenkins-infra/jenkins-security-scan`], alongside the wrapper script that invokes the CodeQL CLI and uploads the report to GitHub.
Please file an issue there to provide feedback for the workflow and action.

To provide feedback about the specific findings, please file an issue in https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins-codeql[`jenkins-infra/jenkins-codeql`].
Improvements to the code scanning rules are also welcome.
