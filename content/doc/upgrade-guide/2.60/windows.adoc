== Upgrading Windows masters and agents for 2.60.1

The following features can be enabled after upgrading Jenkins to 2.60.1:

* Automatic upgrade of link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting[Remoting] library (`slave.jar`) on agents
* Automatic termination of runaway agent processes on agents
* Automatic termination of Jenkins controller processes

NOTE: The described features and guidelines apply to classic JNLP agents installed as services.
Plugins like plugin:windows-slaves[Windows Agents Plugin] do not offer all features so far, see link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-42743[JENKINS-42743].

=== Upgrading old Jenkins agents

The upgrade steps are described in the https://github.com/jenkinsci/windows-slave-installer-module#upgrading-old-agents[Agent Upgrade Guide] (Windows Agent Installer Module Docs).

The only non-trivial action is a XML configuration change.
During the 2.60.1 upgrade it is recommended to perform the following steps:

1. Add the link:https://github.com/kohsuke/winsw/blob/master/doc/extensions/runawayProcessKiller.md[Runaway Process Killer] extension.
 ** See the example in the template referenced below.
2. Enable automatic download of the `slave.jar` file
 ** Example: `<download from="JENKINS_URL/jnlpJars/slave.jar" to="%BASE%\slave.jar"/>` (replace `JENKINS_URL` by the actual URL)

NOTE: If you use Jenkins with HTTP over insecure network, be aware of the risk of MITM attacks.
By default new agents have auto-update enabled for HTTPS only.

When updating the `jenkins-slave.xml` configuration file, you can use
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/windows-slave-installer-module/blob/windows-slave-installer-1.9/src/main/resources/org/jenkinsci/modules/windows_slave_installer/jenkins-slave.xml[this file]
as a template for the new configuration.

=== Upgrading Jenkins controller

Jenkins controller executables may run away in some rare cases, hence it is recommended to enable the link:https://github.com/kohsuke/winsw/blob/master/doc/extensions/runawayProcessKiller.md[Runaway Process Killer] for them.

In order to upgrade the master and enable this feature, perform the following steps:

1. Update Jenkins to 2.60.1 and start the instance. It will automatically upgrade the `jenkins.exe` file.
2. Stop the Jenkins service
3. Modify `jenkins.xml` in the Jenkins home directory
** To enable Runaway Process Killer, add link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/windows-slave-installer-module/blob/windows-slave-installer-1.9/src/main/resources/org/jenkinsci/modules/windows_slave_installer/jenkins-slave.xml#L62-L75[the following entry] to `jenkins.xml`
4. Start Jenkins again

To verify the upgrade correctness, check the `jenkins.wrapper.log` output.
It should contain log entries related Runaway Process Killer after the successful startup.

=== Enabling extra Windows service features

WinSW and Agent installer offer many advanced features you may want to enable.
