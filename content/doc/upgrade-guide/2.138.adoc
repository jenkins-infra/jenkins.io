== Upgrading to Jenkins LTS 2.138.x

Each section covers the upgrade from the previous LTS release, the section on 2.138.1 covers the upgrade from 2.121.3.

[#SECURITY-1072]
==== Migration of user records

link:/security/advisory/2018-12-05/#SECURITY-1072[SECURITY-1072]

After applying this upgrade, Jenkins will migrate the user records to a slightly different storage format that uses a central index to map user IDs to directory names.
This is a backwards incompatible change, so older releases of Jenkins will not be able to deal with the new storage format.
We strongly recommend taking a full backup of at least the `$JENKINS_HOME/users/` directory before upgrading.

If Jenkins crashes or is killed during startup, the migration may be incomplete, possibly making a subset of user records unavailable.
To determine whether this is the case, check for the existence of the file `$JENKINS_HOME/users/users.xml`.
If it does not exist, but user directories have been renamed as described below, the migration was interrupted.
In such cases, if no backup is available, we recommend checking the Jenkins system log and using the information in it to restore directories to their previous names.
The log entries look similar to the following message:

----
INFO: Migrating user 'admin' from 'users/admin/' to 'users/admin_6635238516816951048/'
----

In this case, rename the directory `$JENKINS_HOME/users/admin_6635238516816951048/` to `$JENKINS_HOME/users/admin/` while Jenkins is not running.
Repeat this for all other user directories listed in the log.
Doing all of the above will undo the partial migration.
Jenkins will re-run it on the next startup.

If Jenkins needs to be downgraded after an update and successfully applied user directory migration, do all of the above and additionally delete the `$JENKINS_HOME/users/users.xml` file.
This reverts the migration and restored all user records to a format compatible with Jenkins 2.138.3 and earlier.

IMPORTANT: Please note that downgrading Jenkins is not generally supported, and may fail for reasons unrelated to this migration.


[#SECURITY-595]
==== New restrictions on HTTP request routing

link:/security/advisory/2018-12-05/#SECURITY-595[SECURITY-595]

A design flaw in the Stapler web framework allowed accessing fields and invoking methods that were not intended to be invoked this way by accessing specific URLs.
link:/security/advisory/2018-12-05/#SECURITY-595[For further details, see the security advisory].

As a side effect of this security fix, some HTTP requests will no longer work as before.
This typically results in `HTTP 404 Not Found` responses, although a very small subset of requests will be successful, but the response will simply be different than it would have been before the fix was applied.
Whenever either happens, Jenkins write a message similar to the following to the Jenkins system log:

----
WARNING: New Stapler routing rules result in the URL "/example" no longer being allowed. If you consider it safe to use, add the following to the whitelist: "method hudson.model.Hudson doExample". Learn more: https://jenkins.io/redirect/stapler-routing
----

If this happens due to legitimate use of the Jenkins UI, the affected signature can be added to the list of approved signatures.
To do this, run the following command in the Jenkins script console as administrator:

----
jenkins.security.stapler.StaticRoutingDecisionProvider.get().add('method hudson.model.Hudson doExample')
----

This will create a file called `stapler-whitelist.txt` in the Jenkins home directory, and add the specified entry.
This file can also be modified manually, but the following script needs to be executed afterwards to apply any changes if Jenkins is already running:

----
jenkins.security.stapler.StaticRoutingDecisionProvider.get().reload()
----

We track known affected plugins and their status in link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Plugins+affected+by+the+SECURITY-595+fix[the Jenkins wiki].

=== Upgrading to Jenkins LTS 2.138.3

No notable changes requiring upgrade notes.

=== Upgrading to Jenkins LTS 2.138.2

==== Security hardening to prevent XSS vulnerabilities

A security hardening to prevent cross-site scripting vulnerabilities from being exploitable was applied to views in Jenkins.
This can in rare cases result in views having some content escaped twice (typically resulting in visible HTML entities).

We consider these effects to be a bug in plugins that either opt out of the default test suite, or use outdated toolchains.
We track known affected plugins and their status on https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Plugins+affected+by+2018-10-10+Stapler+security+hardening[the Jenkins wiki].

As a temporary workaround, this hardening can be disabled by setting the system property `org.kohsuke.stapler.jelly.CustomJellyContext.escapeByDefault` to `false`.

==== Warning logged on first startup after upgrade

https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-53998[JENKINS-53998]

When starting Jenkins 2.138.2 for the first time, a warning like the following might be logged if the plugin:jobConfigHistory[Job Config History Plugin] is installed in a version older than 2.19.

----
Oct 10, 2018 2:27:17 PM hudson.ExtensionFinder$GuiceFinder$FaultTolerantScope$1 error
WARNING: Failed to instantiate Key[type=jenkins.telemetry.Correlator, annotation=[none]]; skipping this component
com.google.inject.ProvisionException: Unable to provision, see the following errors:

1) Tried proxying jenkins.telemetry.Correlator to support a circular dependency, but it is not an interface.
----

This does not appear to result in further problems.
Subsequent restarts of Jenkins will no longer log this warning.

==== Security hardening impacts use of GitHub OAuth Plugin

https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-54031[JENKINS-54031]

A security hardening in 2.138.2 and 2.146 can result in problems accessing jobs with plugin:github-oauth[GitHub OAuth Plugin] due to a bug in the plugin.

As a workaround, it is possible to temporarily disable part of the security hardening by setting the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Features+controlled+by+system+properties[Java system properties] `hudson.model.AbstractItem.skipPermissionCheck` and `hudson.model.Run.skipPermissionCheck` to `true`.

IMPORTANT: Please see the link:/security/advisory/2018-12-05/#SECURITY-595[description of SECURITY-595 in the 2018-12-05 security advisory] for important information about this workaround.

=== Upgrading to Jenkins LTS 2.138.1

==== New login and user signup pages

link:/blog/2018/06/27/new-login-page/[Announcement blog post],
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-50447[JENKINS-50447]

The login and user signup pages have been redesigned.
As a side effect, existing `PageDecorator` implementations will not be used on the redesigned pages.

See the link:/blog/2018/06/27/new-login-page/[announcement blog post] for further information.


==== New API token system

link:/blog/2018/07/02/new-api-token-system/[Announcement blog post],
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-32442[JENKINS-32442],
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-32776[JENKINS-32776]

The per-user API tokens that allow access to the HTTP remote API have been redesigned:
API tokens can now be created and revoked, and are stored in a non-recoverable format.

See the link:/blog/2018/07/02/new-api-token-system/[announcement blog post] for further information.


==== Disabled deprecated agent protocols

https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-48480[JENKINS-48480]

The deprecated Jenkins CLI Protocol versions 1 and 2, and Java Web Start Agent Protocol versions 1, 2, and 3 have been disabled.

If you still use these protocols (e.g. remoting-based CLI, or old `slave.jar` files on agents), you need to re-enable these protocols after upgrade, or upgrade the clients.
The same recommendations as in link:https://jenkins.io/doc/upgrade-guide/2.121/#remoting-update[the 2.121.x upgrade guide for remoting changes] apply here.

==== Require GNU C Library 2.7 or above on Unix systems

jira:JENKINS-52771[]

Starting from this version, Jenkins requires link:https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/[GNU C Library] version 2.7 or above.
It makes some Linux distributions unsupported, in particular RHEL 5 and CentOS 5.
See jira:JENKINS-53924[] and jira:JENKINS-53832[] for more info.
