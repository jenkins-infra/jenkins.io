title: Servlet Container Support Policy
---

This page documents the servlet container support policy for the Jenkins controller.

== Why?

Jenkins is typically run as a standalone application in its own process.
The Jenkins WAR file bundles link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/winstone[Winstone],
a link:https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/[Jetty] servlet container wrapper,
and can be started on any operating system or platform with a version of Java supported by Jenkins.
This is the preferred way to deploy Jenkins and is fully supported.

Theoretically, Jenkins can also be run as a servlet in a traditional servlet container
like link:https://tomcat.apache.org/[Apache Tomcat] or link:https://www.wildfly.org/[WildFly],
but in practice this is largely untested and there are many caveats.
In particular, support for WebSocket agents is only implemented for the Jetty servlet container.

WARNING: Support for traditional servlet containers may be discontinued in the future.

== Support levels

We define multiple support levels for servlet containers.

[width="100%",cols="20%,35%,45%",options="header",]
|===
|Support level |Description |Servlet containers

| **Level 1:** Supported
| We run automated testing for these servlet containers, and we intend to fix reported issues in a timely manner.
a|The versions of Winstone and Jetty bundled in the Jenkins link:/doc/book/installing/war-file/[WAR file].

| **Level 2:** Patches considered
| Support may have limitations and extra requirements.
  We do not regularly test compatibility, and we may drop support at any time.
  We consider patches that do not put Level 1 support at risk and do not create maintenance overhead.
a|
  * Tomcat 9, based on Servlet API 4.0 (Jakarta EE 8) with `javax.servlet` imports.
  * WildFly 26, based on Servlet API 4.0 (Jakarta EE 8) with `javax.servlet` imports.
  * Other servlet containers that are based on Servlet API 4.0 (Jakarta EE 8) with `javax.servlet` imports.

| **Level 3:** Unsupported
| These versions are known to be incompatible or to have severe limitations.
  We do not support the listed servlet containers.
a|
  * Jetty 11 or later, based on Servlet API 5.0 (Jakarta EE 9) or later with `jakarta.servlet` imports.
  * Tomcat 10 or later, based on Servlet API 5.0 (Jakarta EE 9) or later with `jakarta.servlet` imports.
  * WildFly 27 or later, based on Servlet API 5.0 (Jakarta EE 9) or later with `jakarta.servlet` imports.
  * Other servlet containers that are based on Servlet API 5.0 (Jakarta EE 9) or later with `jakarta.servlet` imports.
