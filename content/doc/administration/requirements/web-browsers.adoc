title:  Browser compatibility
---

NOTE: This page documents the browser support policy in the Jenkins automation server.
It does not apply to the Jenkins website or other services hosted by the Jenkins project.

== Support model

Jenkins web browser support falls into one of three classes:

. Level 1:  Aim to proactively fix these browsers and provide an equal
UX across all.
. Level 2:  Accept patches to fix issues and make a best effort to
ensure there is at least one way to do any action.
. Level 3:  No guarantees. We will accept patches, but only if they are
low risk. *This is the default unless a browser/version is listed
below*.

We do not claim any compatibility with, or accept bug reports and
patches, for pre-release (e.g. alpha, beta or canary) versions of
browsers.
