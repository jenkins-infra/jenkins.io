title:  Java requirements

There are separate run and job execution requirements for Jenkins installations.

## Running Jenkins

Modern Jenkins versions have the following Java requirements:

* Java 8 runtime environments are supported in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions
* Java 11 runtime environments are supported
** Java 11 Docker installation instructions are included in link:/doc/book/installing/docker/#downloading-and-running-jenkins-in-docker["Downloading and running Jenkins in Docker"]
** See the link:/doc/administration/requirements/upgrade-java-guidelines[Java 8 to Java 11 upgrade guidelines] for additional upgrade instructions
* Java 7 and prior are not supported
* Java 9 and 10 are not supported
* Java 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 are not supported
* Java 17 is available for early adopters when using the Docker images (`jenkins/jenkins:jdk17-preview`)

These requirements apply to all components of the Jenkins system, including Jenkins controller,
all types of agents, CLI clients, and other components.

Jenkins project performs a full test flow with the following JDK/JREs:

* OpenJDK JDK / JRE 8 - 64 bits
* OpenJDK JDK / JRE 11 - 64 bits

JRE/JDKs from other vendors are supported and may be used.
See link:/redirect/issue-tracker[our Issue tracker] for known Java compatibility issues.

## Executing jobs on Jenkins

Jenkins jobs may be executed on Java versions different from the controller/agent runtime.
Generally, Jenkins allows ANY version of JRE/JDK to be invoked during the build.
It includes:

* Execution of Java commands from CLI
* Installation and execution of build steps using JDK managed by JDK tool installers

In the case of particular plugins, there are still Java requirements:

* If you use plugin:maven-plugin[Maven Integration Plugin], version of the JDK used for the build must be equal
to the version used by Jenkins
* If you use plugin:swarm[Swarm Plugin] to create agents,
JRE version must be equal to the version of the controller
* If you use plugin:docker-workflow[Docker Pipeline Plugin] with a bundled JRE/JDK to execute jobs,
versions of such bundled Java must be equal to the version of the controller

## Monitoring Java versions

Modern versions of Jenkins controllers and Jenkins agents verify Java requirements
and notify users when they are launched with an unsupported version.

The plugin:versioncolumn[Jenkins Versions Node Monitors plugin] provides detailed Java version monitoring.
