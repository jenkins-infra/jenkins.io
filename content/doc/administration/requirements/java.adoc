There are separate run and job execution requirements for Jenkins installations.

## Running Jenkins

Modern Jenkins versions have the following Java requirements:

* Java 8 is the **ONLY** supported runtime environment, both 32-bit and 64-bit versions are supported
* Older versions of Java are not supported
* Java 9 is not supported
* Java 10 and 11 preview support is available
** Support of these versions is available through custom packages
** link:/blog/2018/06/17/running-jenkins-with-java10-11/[This page] provides guidelines about running Jenkins with these versions

These requirements apply to all components of the Jenkins system including Jenkins master,
all types of agents, CLI clients, and other components.

Jenkins project performs a full test flow with the following JDK/JREs:

* OpenJDK JDK / JRE 8 - 64 bits

JRE/JDKs from other vendors are supported and may be used.
See link:/redirect/issue-tracker[our Issue tracker] for known Java compatibility issues.

## Executing jobs on Jenkins

Jenkins jobs may be executed on Java versions different from the master/agent runtime.
Generally, Jenkins allows ANY version of JRE/JDK to be invoked during the build.
It includes:

* Execution of Java commands from CLI
* Installation and execution of build steps based on the plugin:jdk-tool plugin

In the case of particular plugins, there are still Java requirements:

* If you use plugin:maven-plugin[Maven Integration Plugin], version of JDK used for the build must be equal
to the version used by Jenkins
* If you use plugin:swarm[Swarm Plugin] to create agents,
JRE version must be equal to the version of the master
* If you use plugin:docker-workflow[Docker Pipeline Plugin] with a bundled JRE/JDK to execute jobs,
versions of such bundled Java must be equal to the version of the master

## Monitoring Java versions

Modern versions of Jenkins master and agents verify Java requirements
and notify users when they are launched with unsupported version.

In order to do fine-grain monitoring of Java versions on agents,
you can use plugin:versioncolumn[Jenkins Versions Node Monitors plugin] to setup Java version monitoring across the Jenkins system.
