There are separate run and job execution requirements for Jenkins installations.

## Running Jenkins

Java 11 is required for running modern versions of Jenkins.
Upgrading an existing Jenkins setup from Java 8 to Java 11?
Refer to the link:/doc/administration/requirements/upgrade-java-guidelines[upgrade guidelines].

Java 11 Docker installation instructions are included in link:/doc/book/installing/docker/#downloading-and-running-jenkins-in-docker["Downloading and running Jenkins in Docker"].

Starting with the Jenkins 2.357 weekly release and the Long Term Support release 2.361.1, Java 11 or Java 17 is required.

Java 17 users can run the `jenkins/jenkins:jdk17` Docker image.

All other Java versions are not supported.

These requirements apply to all components of the Jenkins system, including the Jenkins controller, all types of agents, CLI clients, and other components.

Jenkins project performs a full test flow with the following JDK/JREs:

* OpenJDK JDK / JRE 11 - 64 bits
* OpenJDK JDK / JRE 17 - 64 bits

JRE/JDKs from other vendors are supported and may be used.
Refer to link:/redirect/issue-tracker[our issue tracker] for known Java compatibility issues.

## Executing jobs on Jenkins

Jenkins jobs may be executed on Java versions different from the controller/agent runtime.
Generally, Jenkins allows ANY version of JRE/JDK to be invoked during the build.
It includes:

* Execution of Java commands from CLI
* Installation and execution of build steps using JDK managed by JDK tool installers

In the case of particular plugins, there are still Java requirements:

* If you use the plugin:maven-plugin[Maven Integration Plugin], version of the JDK used for the build must be equal to the version used by Jenkins.
* If you use the plugin:swarm[Swarm Plugin] to create agents, the JRE version must be equal to the version of the controller.
* If you use the plugin:docker-workflow[Docker Pipeline Plugin] with a bundled JRE/JDK to execute jobs, versions of bundled Java must be equal to the version of the controller.

## Monitoring Java versions

Modern versions of Jenkins controllers and Jenkins agents verify Java requirements
and notify users when they are launched with an unsupported version.

The plugin:versioncolumn[Jenkins Versions Node Monitors plugin] provides detailed Java version monitoring.
