If you have a test runner (such as maven surefire, or many of the
javascript runners) chances are it can output the junit/xml style of
test result reports. If so, recording them is easy:

[source,groovy]
----
post {
  always {
    junit "path/to/xml"
  }
}
----

This will always grab the test results and let Jenkins track them,
calculate trends, and report on them. Jenkins has plugins for pretty
much all other types of test runners too. A build that has failing tests
is marked as `UNSTABLE` (to separate it from `FAILED`).

If you want to store an artifact for downloading later (i.e., keep a
record of it):

[source,groovy]
----
post {
   success {
      archive "target/**/*"
   }
}
----

You can also run actions, such as notifications, artifact archiving, or
any arbitrary step, after individual stages:

[source,groovy]
----
stage('some-stage') {
    steps {
        sh 'do-something.sh'
    }
    post {
        failure {
            sh 'rollback.sh'
        }
    }
}
----

A more complete example:

[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
    agent docker:"java"
    stages {
        stage("build") {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true'
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        always {
            archive "target/**/*"
            junit 'target/surefire-reports/*.xml'
        }
    }
}
