The
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Model+Definition+Plugin[plugin
page on the Jenkins project wiki] always will contain a full list of
changes in releases of the Declarative Pipelines plugin, but you can
find more detail on specific changes here.

[[version-0.6]]
Version 0.6
~~~~~~~~~~~

* _Release Date_: November 17, 2016
* _Major Changes_:
** _COMPATIBILITY BREAKING SYNTAX CHANGE_: The `notifications` section
has been removed, and the `postBuild` section has been renamed to
`post`, for consistency with post-stage actions. Use `post` for what you
had been using both `postBuild` and `notifications`.
** New `dockerfile` option for `agent` to auto-build a Dockerfile
(defaults to `ROOT_DIR/Dockerfile` if `dockerfile:true` is used,
otherwise uses value of `dockerfile`) and run the build in a container
based on that image.
** New `when` section for an individual `stage`. Takes a block of
arbitrary Pipeline code, runs it, and only executes the `stage`'s
contents if that code block returns `true`.

[[version-0.5]]
Version 0.5
~~~~~~~~~~~

* _Release Date_: November 2, 2016
* _Major Changes_:
** _COMPATIBILITY BREAKING SYNTAX CHANGE_: Steps inside a `stage` now
need to be in a `steps` block. This was needed to support per-`stage`
configuration of a number of sections, as described below.
** New `post` section supported inside a `stage` for post-`stage`
actions. This behaves the same as the `postBuild` section, but runs
after a single `stage`.
** New `agent` section supported inside a `stage`. This overrides the
top-level `agent` configuration for the individual `stage`.
** New `tools` section supported inside a `stage`. This allows scoping
`tools` on a per-`stage` basis.
** New `environment` section supported inside a `stage`. This allows
scoping `environment` on a per-`stage` basis.
** A new configuration option, available both in the Jenkins global
configuration and in folder configurations (such as GitHub Multibranch
Pipelines), for specifying a default label to use for Docker agents.
** New `wrappers` section at the top-level, for wrapping the entire
build in a block-scoped step, such as `retry` or `timeout`.

[[version-0.4]]
Version 0.4
~~~~~~~~~~~

* _Release Date_: October 11, 2016
* _Major Changes_:
** New `triggers`, `jobProperties` and `parameters` sections at the
top-level.
** New syntax for specifying to run on any node - `agent any`
** Allow function or step calls in the values of environment variables
in the `environment` section.
