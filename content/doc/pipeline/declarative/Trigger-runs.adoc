Triggers
--------

Runs of a pipeline are normally triggered by a SCM change. However, you
can specify other triggers like a cron-based schedule:

....
pipeline {
    agent any

    triggers {
        cron '@daily'
    }

   ...
}
....

This will run the pipeline once per day. The Unix cron style syntax is
supported.

Additional repositories
-----------------------

A pipeline, even one that is defined a Jenkinsfile, can also bring in
other source repositories as needed.

For example:

....
pipeline {
    agent none
    stages {
        stage('build') {
            agent any    
            steps {
                // run main build here and collect the results via "stashing" for later use
                stash includes: 'app/*.py', name: 'stuff'
            }
        }

        stage('testing') {
            agent label:'master'
            steps {
                // use a different repo to get the test suite:
                git 'https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness'

                // we unstash our stuff from before (because this may be a different node)
                unstash 'stuff'

                sh 'run-test-suite.sh'    

            }

        }
    }

}
....

Jenkins will track changes from all repositories you mention this way,
and allow the pipeline run to be triggered accordingly.
