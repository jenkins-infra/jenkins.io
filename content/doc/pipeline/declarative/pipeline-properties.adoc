= Setting Pipeline Properties

One important option you may want to set up is the log rotation, meaning
how long pipeline runs are retained for:

....
pipeline {
    agent any

    jobProperties {
        buildDiscarder(logRotator(numToKeepStr:'5'))
    }

    ...
}
....

There are other advanced properties that you may need to set from time
to time - they go in this section. It is likely you won't need more than
what is shown above.
