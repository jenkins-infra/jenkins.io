title: Reporting test results and storing artifacts
section: doc
---

If you have a test runner (such as maven surefire, or many of the javascript runners) the chances are it can output the junit/xml style of test result reports. If so, recording them is easy:

----
postBuild {
  always {
    junit "path/to/xml"
  }
}
----

This will always grab the test results and let Jenkins track them, calculate trends and report on them. Jenkins has plugins for pretty much all other types of test runners too. A build that has failing tests is marked as `UNSTABLE` (to separate it from `FAILED`).

If you want to store an artifact for downloading later (ie keep a record of it):

----
postBuild {
   success {
      archive "target/**/*"
   }
}
----

A more complete example:

----

pipeline {
    agent docker:"java"
    stages {
        stage("build") {
            sh 'mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true'
        }
    }

    postBuild {
        always {
            archive "target/**/*"
            junit 'target/surefire-reports/*.xml'
        }
    }
}
----
