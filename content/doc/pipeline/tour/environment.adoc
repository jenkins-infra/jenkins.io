Environment variables can be set globally, like the example below, or per
stage. As you might expect, setting environment variables per stage means they
will only apply to the stage in which they're defined.


[pipeline]
----
// Declarative //
pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        DISABLE_AUTH = 'true'
        DB_ENGINE    = 'sqlite'
    }

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'printenv'
            }
        }
    }
}
// Scripted //
node {
    withEnv(['DISABLE_AUTH=true',
             'DB_ENGINE=sqlite']) {
        stage('Build') {
            sh 'printenv'
        }
    }
}

This approach to defining environment variables from within the `Jenkinsfile`
can be very useful for instructing scripts, such as a `Makefile`, to configure
the build or tests differently to run them inside of Jenkins.

Another common use for environment variables is to set or override "dummy"
credentials in build or test scripts. Because it's (_obviously_) a bad idea to
put credentials directly into a `Jenkinsfile`, Jenkins Pipeline allows users to quickly
and safely access pre-defined credentials in the `Jenkinsfile` without ever
needing to know their values.

=== Credentials in the Environment

If your Jenkins environment has credentials configured, such as build secrets
or API tokens, those can be easily inserted into environment variables for use
in the Pipeline. The snippet below is for "Secret Text" type Credentials, for
example.

[source, groovy]
----
environment {
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID     = credentials('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = credentials('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
}
----

Just as the first example, these variables will be available either globally or
per-stage depending on where the `environment` directive is located in the
`Jenkinsfile`.

The second most common type of Credentials is "Username and Password" which can
still be used in the `environment` directive, but results in slightly
different variables being set.

[source,groovy]
----
environment {
   SAUCE_ACCESS = credentials('sauce-lab-dev')
}
----

This will actually set 3 environment variables:

* `SAUCE_ACCESS` containing `<username>:<password>`
* `SAUCE_ACCESS_USR` containing the username
* `SAUCE_ACCESS_PSW` containing the password

[NOTE]
====
`credentials` is only available for Declarative Pipeline. For those using Scripted
Pipeline, see the documentation for the `withCredentials` step.

Thus far we have concerned ourselves with creating a Pipeline that is
configured and executes the way we might expect. In the next couple sections,
we'll cover another crucial aspect of continuous delivery: surfacing feedback
and information.
