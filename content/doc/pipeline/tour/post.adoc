title: Cleaning up and notifications
---

Since the `post` section of a Pipeline is guaranteed to run at the end of a
Pipeline's execution, we can add some notification or other steps to perform
finalization, notification, or other end-of-Pipeline tasks.

NOTE: See link:../../../book/glossary/#build-status[Glossary - Build Status]
for the different build statuses: SUCCESS, UNSTABLE, and FAILED.

[pipeline]
----
// Declarative //
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('No-op') {
            steps {
                sh 'ls'
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        always {
            echo 'One way or another, I have finished'
            deleteDir() /* clean up our workspace */
        }
        success {
            echo 'I succeeded!'
        }
        unstable {
            echo 'I am unstable :/'
        }
        failure {
            echo 'I failed :('
        }
        changed {
            echo 'Things were different before...'
        }
    }
}
// Scripted //
node {
    try {
        stage('No-op') {
            sh 'ls'
        }
    }
    catch (exc) {
        echo 'I failed'
    }
    finally {
        if (currentBuild.result == 'UNSTABLE') {
            echo 'I am unstable :/'
        } else {
            echo 'One way or another, I have finished'
        }
    }
}

There are plenty of ways to send notifications, below are a few snippets
demonstrating how to send notifications about a Pipeline to an email or a Slack channel.

=== Email

[source, groovy]
----
post {
    failure {
        mail to: 'team@example.com',
             subject: "Failed Pipeline: ${currentBuild.fullDisplayName}",
             body: "Something is wrong with ${env.BUILD_URL}"
    }
}
----

=== Slack

[source,groovy]
----
post {
    success {
        slackSend channel: '#ops-room',
                  color: 'good',
                  message: "The pipeline ${currentBuild.fullDisplayName} completed successfully."
    }
}
----


Now that the team is being notified when things are failing, unstable, or even
succeeding we can finish our continuous delivery pipeline with the exciting
part: shipping!
