In the
link:../running-multiple-steps[previous section]
you may have noticed the `agent` directive in each of the examples. The
`agent` directive tells Jenkins where and how to execute the Pipeline, or
subset thereof. As you might expect, the `agent` is required for all Pipelines.


Underneath the hood, there are a few things `agent` causes to happen:

* All the steps contained within the block are queued for execution by Jenkins.
  As soon as an <<../../book/glossary/#executor, executor>> is available, the
  steps will begin to execute.
* A <<../../book/glossary/#workspace, workspace>> is allocated which will
  contain files checked out from source control as well as any additional
  working files for the Pipeline.


There are several
link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax#agent[ways to define agents]
for use in Pipeline, for this tour we will only focus on using an ephemeral
Docker container.

Pipeline is designed to easily use
link:https://docs.docker.com/[Docker]
images and containers to
run inside. This allows the Pipeline to define the environment
and tools required without having to configure various system tools
and dependencies on agents manually. This approach allows you to use
practically any tool which can be
link:https://hub.docker.com[packaged in a Docker container].


For more agent specification options, consult the
link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax#agent[syntax reference].

[pipeline]
----
// Declarative //
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker { image 'node:7-alpine' }
    }
    stages {
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'node --version'
            }
        }
    }
}
// Script //
node {
    /* Requires the Docker Pipeline plugin to be installed */
    docker.image('node:7-alpine').inside {
        stage('Test') {
            sh 'node --version'
        }
    }
}
----

When the Pipeline executes, Jenkins will automatically start the specified
container and execute the defined steps within it:

[source]
----
[Pipeline] stage
[Pipeline] { (Test)
[Pipeline] sh
[guided-tour] Running shell script
+ node --version
v7.4.0
[Pipeline] }
[Pipeline] // stage
[Pipeline] }
----

Mixing and matching different containers, or other agents, allows quite a lot
of flexibility when executing a Pipeline, for more configuration options,
