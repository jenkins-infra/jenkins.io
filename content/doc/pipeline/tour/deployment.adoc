The most basic continuous delivery pipeline will have, at minimum, three stages
which should be defined in a `Jenkinsfile`: Build, Test, and Deploy. For this
section we will focus primarily on the Deploy stage, but it should be noted
that stable Build and Test stages are an important precursor to any deployment
activity.

[pipeline]
----
// Declarative //
pipeline {
    agent any
    options {
        skipStagesAfterUnstable()
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying'
            }
        }
    }
}
// Scripted //
node {
    stage('Build') {
        echo 'Building'
    }
    stage('Test') {
        echo 'Testing'
    }
    if (currentBuild.currentResult == 'SUCCESS') {
        stage('Deploy') {
            echo 'Deploying'
        }
    }
}

== Stages as Deployment Environments

One common pattern is to extend the number of stages to capture additional
deployment environments, like "staging" or "production", as shown in the
following snippet.

[source,groovy]
----
stage('Deploy - Staging') {
    steps {
        sh './deploy staging'
        sh './run-smoke-tests'
    }
}
stage('Deploy - Production') {
    steps {
        sh './deploy production'
    }
}
----

In this example, we're assuming that whatever "smoke tests" are run by our
`./run-smoke-tests` script are sufficient to qualify or validate a release to
the production environment. This kind of pipeline that automatically deploys
code all the way through to production can be considered an implementation of
"continuous deployment." While this is a noble ideal, for many there are
good reasons why continuous _deployment_ might not be practical, but those can
still enjoy the benefits of continuous _delivery_.
footnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery]
Jenkins Pipeline readily supports both.

== Asking for human input to proceed

Often when passing between stages, especially environment stages, you may want
human input before continuing. For example, to judge if the application is in a
good enough state to "promote" to the production environment. This can be
accomplished with the `input` step. In the example below, the "Sanity check"
stage actually blocks for input and won't proceed without a person confirming
the progress.

[pipeline]
----
// Declarative //
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        /* "Build" and "Test" stages omitted */

        stage('Deploy - Staging') {
            steps {
                sh './deploy staging'
                sh './run-smoke-tests'
            }
        }

        stage('Sanity check') {
            steps {
                input "Does the staging environment look ok?"
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy - Production') {
            steps {
                sh './deploy production'
            }
        }
    }
}
// Scripted //
node {
    /* "Build" and "Test" stages omitted */

    stage('Deploy - Staging') {
        sh './deploy staging'
        sh './run-smoke-tests'
    }

    stage('Sanity check') {
        input "Does the staging environment look ok?"
    }

    stage('Deploy - Production') {
        sh './deploy production'
    }
}

== Conclusion

This Guided Tour introduced you to the basics of using Jenkins and Jenkins
Pipeline. Because Jenkins is extremely extensible, it can be modified and
configured to handle practically _any_ aspect of automation. To learn more
