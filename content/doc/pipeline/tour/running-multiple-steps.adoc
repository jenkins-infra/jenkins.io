Pipelines are made up of multiple steps that allow you to build, test and
deploy applications. Jenkins Pipeline allows you to compose multiple steps in
an easy way that can help you model any sort of automation process.

Think of a "step" like a single command which performs a single action. When a
step succeeds it moves onto the next step. When a step fails to execute
correctly the Pipeline will fail.

When all the steps in the Pipeline have successfully completed the Pipeline is
considered to have successfully executed.

=== Linux, BSD, and Mac OS

On Linux, BSD, and Mac OS (Unix-like) systems, the `sh` step is used to execute
a shell command in a Pipeline.

[pipeline]
----
// Declarative //
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'echo "Hello World"'
                sh '''
                    echo "Multiline shell steps works too"
                    ls -lah
                '''
            }
        }
    }
}
// Scripted //
node {
    stage('Build') {
        sh 'echo "Hello World"'
        sh '''
            echo "Multiline shell steps works too"
            ls -lah
        '''
    }
}
----

=== Windows

Windows-based systems should use the `bat` step for executing batch commands.

[pipeline]
----
// Declarative //
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                bat 'set'
            }
        }
    }
}
// Scripted //
node {
    stage('Build') {
        bat 'set'
    }
}

XXX: (rtyler) I think this section doesn't belong at this point in the Guided Tour
     may need to figure out a better place to introduce additional steps and
     wrappers steps

== Timeouts, retries and more

There are some powerful steps that "wrap" other steps which can easily solve
problems like retrying (`retry`) steps until successful or exiting if a
step takes too long (`timeout`).

[pipeline]
----
// Declarative //
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                retry(3) {
                    sh './flakey-deploy.sh'
                }

                timeout(time: 3, unit: 'MINUTES') {
                    sh './health-check.sh'
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
// Scripted //
node {
    stage('Deploy') {
        retry(3) {
            sh './flakey-deploy.sh'
        }

        timeout(time: 3, unit: 'MINUTES') {
            sh './health-check.sh'
        }
    }
}
----

The "Deploy" stage retries the `flakey-deploy.sh` script 3 times, and then
waits for up to 3 minutes for the `health-check.sh` script to execute. If the
health check script does not complete in 3 minutes, the Pipeline will be marked
as having failed in the "Deploy" stage.

"Wrapper" steps such as `timeout` and `retry` may contain other steps,
including `timeout` or `retry`.

We can compose these steps together. For example, if we wanted to retry our
deployment 5 times, but never want to spend more than 3 minutes in total before
failing the stage:

[pipeline]
----
// Declarative //
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                timeout(time: 3, unit: 'MINUTES') {
                    retry(5) {
                        sh './flakey-deploy.sh'
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
// Scripted //
node {
    stage('Deploy') {
        timeout(time: 3, unit: 'MINUTES') {
            retry(5) {
                sh './flakey-deploy.sh'
            }
        }
    }
}

== Finishing up

When the Pipeline has finished executing, you may need to run clean-up steps or
perform some actions based on the outcome of the Pipeline. These actions can be
performed in the `post` section.

[pipeline]
----
// Declarative //
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'echo "Fail!"; exit 1'
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        always {
            echo 'This will always run'
        }
        success {
            echo 'This will run only if successful'
        }
        failure {
            echo 'This will run only if failed'
        }
        unstable {
            echo 'This will run only if the run was marked as unstable'
        }
        changed {
            echo 'This will run only if the state of the Pipeline has changed'
            echo 'For example, if the Pipeline was previously failing but is now successful'
        }
    }
}
// Scripted //
node {
    try {
        stage('Test') {
            sh 'echo "Fail!"; exit 1'
        }
        echo 'This will run only if successful'
    } catch (e) {
        echo 'This will run only if failed'

        // Since we're catching the exception in order to report on it,
        // we need to re-throw it, to ensure that the build is marked as failed
        throw e
    } finally {
        def currentResult = currentBuild.result ?: 'SUCCESS'
        if (currentResult == 'UNSTABLE') {
            echo 'This will run only if the run was marked as unstable'
        }

        def previousResult = currentBuild.previousBuild?.result
        if (previousResult != null && previousResult != currentResult) {
            echo 'This will run only if the state of the Pipeline has changed'
            echo 'For example, if the Pipeline was previously failing but is now successful'
        }

        echo 'This will always run'
    }
}
