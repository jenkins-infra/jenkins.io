While testing is a critical part of a good continuous delivery pipeline, most
people don't want to sift through thousands of lines of console output to find
information about failing tests. To make this easier, Jenkins can record and
aggregate test results so long as your test runner can output test result
files. Jenkins typically comes bundled with the `junit` step, but if your test
runner cannot output JUnit-style XML reports, there are additional plugins
which process practically any widely-used test report format.

To collect our test results and artifacts, we will use the `post` section.

[pipeline]
----
// Declarative //
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh './gradlew check'
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        always {
            junit 'build/reports/**/*.xml'
        }
    }
}
// Scripted //
node {
    try {
        stage('Test') {
            sh './gradlew check'
        }
    } finally {
        junit 'build/reports/**/*.xml'
    }
}
----

This will _always_ grab the test results and let Jenkins track them, calculate
trends and report on them. A Pipeline that has failing tests will be marked as
"link:../../../book/glossary/#build-status[UNSTABLE]", denoted by yellow in the
web UI. That is distinct from the
"link:../../../book/glossary/#build-status[FAILED]" state, denoted by red.

NOTE: Pipeline execution will by default proceed even when the build is unstable.
To skip deployment after test failures in Declarative syntax,
use the `skipStagesAfterUnstable` option.
In Scripted syntax, you may check `currentBuild.currentResult == 'SUCCESS'`.

When there are test failures, it is often useful to grab built artifacts from
Jenkins for local analysis and investigation. This is made practical by
Jenkins's built-in support for storing "artifacts", files generated during the
execution of the Pipeline.

This is easily done with the `archiveArtifacts` step and a file-globbing
expression, as is demonstrated in the example below:

[pipeline]
----
// Declarative //
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh './gradlew build'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh './gradlew check'
            }
        }
    }

    post {
        always {
            archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'build/libs/**/*.jar', fingerprint: true
            junit 'build/reports/**/*.xml'
        }
    }
}
// Scripted //
node {
    try {
        stage('Test') {
            sh './gradlew check'
        }
    } finally {
        archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'build/libs/**/*.jar', fingerprint: true
        junit 'build/reports/**/*.xml'
    }
}
----

If more than one parameter is specified in the `archiveArtifacts` step, then
each parameter's name must explicitly be specified in the step code - i.e.
`artifacts` for the artifact's path and file name and `fingerprint` to choose
this option. If you only need to specify the artifacts' path and file name/s,
then you can omit the parameter name `artifacts` - e.g. +
`+archiveArtifacts 'build/libs/**/*.jar'+`

Recording tests and artifacts in Jenkins is useful for quickly and easily
surfacing information to various members of the team. In the next section we'll
talk about how to *tell* those members of the team what's been happening in our
Pipeline.
