email, hip chat, slack, IRC

The notifications section of a pipeline defines both where to send a notification, and on what event:

----
    notifications {
        always {
            echo "I HAVE FINISHED"
        }
        success {
            echo "MOST DEFINITELY FINISHED"
        }
        failure {
            echo "I FAILED"
        }
        changed {
            echo "Things were different before..."
        }
    }
----

As notifications are 'steps', making use of Jenkins plugins to send them is possible. In this example, using email:

----
    notifications {
        success {
            mail to:"me@example.com", subject:"SUCCESS: ${currentBuild.fullDisplayName}", body: "Yay, we passed."
        }
        failure {
            mail to:"me@example.com", subject:"FAILURE: ${currentBuild.fullDisplayName}", body: "Boo, we failed."
        }
        unstable {
            mail to:"me@example.com", subject:"UNSTABLE: ${currentBuild.fullDisplayName}", body: "Huh, we're unstable."
        }
        changed {
            mail to:"me@example.com", subject:"CHANGED: ${currentBuild.fullDisplayName}", body: "Wow, our status changed!"
        }
    }
----

You can have multiple steps in a notification section, you don't have to pick between email, irc, slack etc, but can use a combination if you like. 

There is also Hipchat, Slack, IRC and more (even Yo has a notifier).

(Seriously: https://github.com/jenkinsci/notify-yo-plugin - it won't work in current form with pipeline, however, and I am not even sure if Yo still exists as an app).


To use HipChat, install and configure this this plugin: https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/HipChat+Plugin, and your notications could look like: 


----
    notifications {
        failure {
            hipchatSend message: "Attention @here ${env.JOB_NAME} #${env.BUILD_NUMBER} has failed.", color: 'RED'
        }
    }
----

To use Slack, install and configure the slack plugin (https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Slack+Plugin), and then use: 


----
    notifications {
        success {
            slackSend channel: '#ops-room', color: 'good', message: 'The pipeline ${currentBuild.rawBuild.fullDisplayName} completed successfully.'
        }
    }
