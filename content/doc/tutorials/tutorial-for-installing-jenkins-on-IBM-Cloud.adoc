This tutorial demonstrates how to deploy Jenkins on IBM Cloud.
Before deploying, you should have an IBM Cloud account, otherwise you can link:http://cloud.ibm.com/registration[register here].
At the end of the tutorial you will have a cluster with Jenkins up and running.

To deploy Jenkins on IBM Cloud:

. <<Provisioning a Kubernetes cluster,Provision a Kubernetes Cluster>>.
If you already have a Kubernetes cluster, you can skip to step 2.
. <<Deploying the IBM Cloud Block Storage plug-in,Deploy IBM Cloud Block Storage plug-in>>.
If you have already deployed the the IBM Cloud Block Storage plug-in, you can skip to step 3.
. <<Deploying Jenkins,Deploy Jenkins>>.
. <<Verifying the Jenkins installation,Verify the Jenkins installation>>.

== Provisioning a Kubernetes cluster

When deploying Jenkins to IBM Cloud, you must first provision a Kubernetes cluster.

NOTE: If you already have a Kubernetes cluster, you can skip to <<Deploying the IBM Cloud Block Storage plug-in>>.

To provision a Kubernetes cluster:

. Select *Catalog* in the upper left corner.
. Select *Service* from the catalog.
. Search for *Kubernetes Service* and select it.
+

+
You are now at the Kubernetes deployment page, and you need to specify some details about the cluster.

. Choose a plan type of *standard* or *free*.
The free plan only has one worker node and no subnet.
. To provision a standard cluster, you will need to upgrade your account to Pay-As-You-Go.
To upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go account, complete the following steps:
.. In the console, go to *Manage > Account*
.. Select *Account settings*, and then select *Add credit card*.
.. Enter your payment information, select *Next*, and then submit your information.
. To choose *Classic* or *VPC*, read the link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-infrastructure_providers[docs], and then select the most suitable type for yourself.
+
image::tutorials/IBMCloud/infra-select.png[IBM infrastructure selection]

. Now choose your location settings.
For more information, please refer to link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-regions-and-zones#zones[Locations].
.. Choose *Geography* (continent).
+
image::tutorials/IBMCloud/location-geo.png[IBM geo location]

.. Choose *Single* or *Multizone*.
In single zone, your data is kept in only one datacenter.
With Multizone, it is distributed to multiple datacenters, and thus safer in an unforeseen zone failure.
+
image::tutorials/IBMCloud/location-avail.png[IBM available locations]

.. Choose a *Worker Zone* if you use Single zones or **Metro** if you use Multizone.
+
image::tutorials/IBMCloud/location-worker.png[IBM worker location]

.. If you wish to use Multizone, set up your account with link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/dl?topic=dl-overview-of-virtual-routing-and-forwarding-vrf-on-ibm-cloud[VRF] or link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vlans?topic=vlans-vlan-spanning#vlan-spanning[enable VLAN spanning].
+
NOTE: If at your current location selection, there is no available Virtual LAN, a new VLAN is created for you.

. Choose a *Worker node setup* or use the preselected one, and then set *Worker node amount per zone*.
+
image::tutorials/IBMCloud/worker-pool.png[IBM worker-pool]

. Choose a *Master service endpoint*.
+
NOTE: When you have a VRF-enabled account, your cluster is set up to use both private and public endpoints by default.

.. Select **Private endpoint only** to make your controller accessible on the private network or via VPN tunnel.
.. Select **Public endpoint only** to make your controller publicly accessible.
For more information, refer to link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-service-endpoints-overview[endpoints].

+
image::tutorials/IBMCloud/endpoints.png[IBM endpoints]

. Enter a *Cluster name*.
+
image::tutorials/IBMCloud/name-new.png[IBM new cluster name]

. Apply the desired *Tags* to your cluster. For more information, refer to link:https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-tag[tags].
+
image::tutorials/IBMCloud/tasg-new.png[IBM adding tags to cluster]

. Select *Create*.
+
image::tutorials/IBMCloud/create-new.png[IBM new cluster creation]

. Wait for your cluster to be provisioned.
+
image::tutorials/IBMCloud/cluster-prepare.png[IBM cluster provisioning]

Your cluster is now ready to use.

== Deploying the IBM Cloud Block Storage plug-in

Once you have provisioned a Kubernetes cluster, you must deploy the IBM Cloud Block Storage plug-in. 
The Block Storage plug-in is a persistent, high-performance iSCSI storage that you can add to your apps by using Kubernetes Persistent Volumes (PVs).

To deploy the Block Storage plug-in:

. Select *Catalog* in the upper left corner.
. Select *Software* from the catalog.
. Search for *IBM Cloud Block Storage plug-in* and select it.
+
image::tutorials/IBMCloud/block-search.png[IBM block search]

. On the application page, select the _empty dot_ next to the cluster you wish to use.
. Select *Target namespace* and choose the default namespace or enter a custom namespace. 
+
NOTE: If you receive an error, please wait 30 minutes for the cluster to finalize.
+
image::tutorials/IBMCloud/block-cluster.png[IBM namespace selection]

. Assign a *name* to this workspace.
. Select *Install* and wait for deployment.
+

== Deploying Jenkins

Once you have provisioned a Kubernetes cluster and deployed the IBM Cloud Block Storage plug-in, you can deploy Jenkins on your cluster.

To deploy Jenkins on your cluster:

. Select *Catalog* in the upper left corner.
. Select *Software* from the catalog.
. Search for *Jenkins* and select it.
+
image::tutorials/IBMCloud/search.png[IBM workspace search]

.  Select *IBM Kubernetes Service*.
+
image::tutorials/IBMCloud/target-select.png[IBM Kubernetes selection]

. On the application page, select the _empty dot_ next to the cluster you wish to use.
+
image::tutorials/IBMCloud/cluster-select.png[IBM cluster selection]

. Select *Target namespace* and then choose the default namespace or use a custom one.
+
image::tutorials/IBMCloud/details-namespace.png[IBM space name]

. Give a unique *Name* to the workspace, that you can easily recognize.
+
image::tutorials/IBMCloud/details-names.png[IBM workspace name]

+
image::tutorials/IBMCloud/details-tags.png[Default value parameters]

. Select *Parameters with default values*.
You can set custom deployment values or use the default ones.
+
image::tutorials/IBMCloud/parameters.png[IBM parameters setup]

. Set the Jenkins password in the parameters.
+
image::tutorials/IBMCloud/password.png[Create password instructions]

== Verifying the Jenkins installation

After deploying Jenkins on your cluster, you can verify the Jenkins installation.

To verify the Jenkins installation:

. Go to link:http://cloud.ibm.com/resources[Resources] in your browser.
. Select *Clusters*.
. Select your cluster.
+

+
Now you are at your cluster overview.
. Select *Actions* in the top right corner of the page.
. Select *Web terminal* in the dropdown menu.
+
image::tutorials/IBMCloud/cluster-main.png[Clusters overview page]

. Select *Install* and then wait for the installation to complete.
+
image::tutorials/IBMCloud/terminal-install.jpg[terminal install screen]

. Once installation has completed, you must repeat this process.

.. Select *Actions*.
.. Select *Web terminal* and a terminal window opens.

. *Type* in the terminal.
You must change `NAMESPACE` to the namespace you chose during the deployment setup.
+
[source,bash]
....
$ kubectl get ns

+
[source,bash]
....
$ kubectl get service -n NAMESPACE
....
+
image::tutorials/IBMCloud/get-service.png[get-service command]
+
The running Jenkins service is now visible.
. Copy the *External-IP*, you can access the website on this IP.
