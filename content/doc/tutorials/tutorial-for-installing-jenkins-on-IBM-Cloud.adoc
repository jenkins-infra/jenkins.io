You should have an IBM Cloud account, otherwise you can http://cloud.ibm.com/registration[register here].
At the end of the tutorial you will have a cluster with Jenkins up and running.

1. We will provision a new Kubernetes Cluster for you if, you already have one skip to <<Step 2 deploy IBM Cloud Block Storage plug-in,step **2**>>
2. We will deploy  the <<Step 2 deploy IBM Cloud Block Storage plug-in,IBM Cloud Block Storage plug-in>>, if already have it skip to <<Step 3 deploy Jenkins,step **3**>>
3. <<Step 3 deploy Jenkins,Jenkins deployment>>

## Step 1 provision Kubernetes Cluster

* Click the **Catalog** button on the top
* Select **Service** from the catalog
* Search for **Kubernetes Service** and click on it

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/kubernetes-select.png[]

* You are now at the Kubernetes deployment page, you need to specify some details about the cluster
* Choose a plan **standard** or **free**, the free plan only has one worker node and no subnet, to provision a standard cluster, you will need to upgrade your account to Pay-As-You-Go
** To upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go account, complete the following steps:
. In the console, go to Manage > Account
. Select Account settings, and click **Add credit card**.
. Enter your payment information, click **Next**, and submit your information
* Choose **classic** or **VPC**, read the https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-infrastructure_providers[docs] and choose the most suitable type for yourself

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/infra-select.png[]

* Now choose your location settings, for more information please visit https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-regions-and-zones#zones[Locations]
** Choose **Geography** (continent)

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/location-geo.png[]

* Choose **Single** or **Multizone**, in single zone your data is only kept in on datacenter, on the other hand with Multizone it is distributed to multiple zones, thus  safer in an unforseen zone failure

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/location-avail.png[]

* Choose a **Worker Zone** if using Single zones or **Metro** if Multizone

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/location-worker.png[]

* If you wish to use Multizone please set up your account with https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/dl?topic=dl-overview-of-virtual-routing-and-forwarding-vrf-on-ibm-cloud[VRF] or https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vlans?topic=vlans-vlan-spanning#vlan-spanning[enable Vlan spanning]
** If at your current location selection, there is no available Virtual LAN, a new Vlan will be created for you

* Choose a **Worker node setup** or use the preselected one, set **Worker node amount per zone**

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/worker-pool.png[]

* Choose **Master Service Endpoint**,  In VRF-enabled accounts, you can choose private-only to make your controller accessible on the private network or via VPN tunnel. Choose public-only to make your controlÃ©er publicly accessible. When you have a VRF-enabled account, your cluster is set up by default to use both private and public endpoints. For more information visit https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-service-endpoints-overview[endpoints].

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/endpoints.png[]

* Give cluster a **name**

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/name-new.png[]

* Give desired **tags** to your cluster, for more information visit https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-tag[tags]

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/tasg-new.png[]

* Click **create**

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/create-new.png[]

* Wait for your cluster to be provisioned

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/cluster-prepare.png[]

* Your cluster is ready for usage

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/cluster-done.png[]

## Step 2 deploy IBM Cloud Block Storage plug-in
The Block Storage plug-in is a persistent, high-performance iSCSI storage that you can add to your apps by using Kubernetes Persistent Volumes (PVs).

* Click the **Catalog** button on the top
* Select **Software** from the catalog
* Search for **IBM Cloud Block Storage plug-in** and click on it

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/block-search.png[]

* On the application page Click in the _dot_ next to the cluster, you wish to use
* Click on **Enter or Select Namespace** and choose the default Namespace or use a custom one (if you get error please wait 30 minutes for the cluster to finalize)

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/block-cluster.png[]

* Give a **name** to this workspace
* Click **install** and wait for the deployment

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/block-storage-create.png[]

## Step 3 deploy Jenkins

We will deploy  Jenkins on our cluster

* Click the **Catalog** button on the top
* Select **Software** from the catalog
* Search for **Jenkins** and click on it

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/search.png[]

* Please select IBM Kubernetes Service

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/target-select.png[]

* On the application page Click in the _dot_ next to the cluster, you wish to use

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/cluster-select.png[]

* Click on **Enter or Select Namespace** and choose the default Namespace or use a custom one

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/details-namespace.png[]

* Give a unique **name** to workspace, which you can easily recognize

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/details-names.png[]

* Select which resource group you want to use, it's for access controland billing purposes. For more information please visit https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-account_setup#bp_resourcegroups[resource groups]

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/details-resource.png[]

* Give **tags** to your Jenkins, for more information visit [tags]

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/details-tags.png[]

* Click on **Parameters with default values**, You can set deployment values or use the default ones

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/parameters.png[]

* Please set the jenkins password in the parameters

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/password.png[]

* After finishing everything, **tick** the box next to the agreements and click **install**

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/install.png[]

* The Jenkins workspace will start installing, wait a couple of minutes

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/in-progress.png[]

* Your  Jenkins workspace has been successfully deployed

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/done.png[]

## Verify Jenkins installation

* Go to http://cloud.ibm.com/resources[Resources] in your browser
* Click on **Clusters**
* Click on your Cluster

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/resource-select.png[]

* Now you are at you clusters overview, here Click on **Actions** and **Web terminal** from the dropdown menu

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/cluster-main.png[]

* Click **install** - wait couple of minutes

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/terminal-install.jpg[]

* Click on **Actions**
* Click **Web terminal** --> a terminal will open up

* **Type** in the terminal, please change NAMESPACE to the namespace you choose at the deployment setup:

[source,bash]
....
$ kubectl get ns
....

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/get-ns.png[]

[source,bash]
....
$ kubectl get pod -n NAMESPACE -o wide
....

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/get-pods.png[]

[source,bash]
....
$ kubectl get service -n NAMESPACE
....

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/get-service.png[]

* Running Jenkins service will be visible
* Copy the **External ip**, you can access the website on this IP
* Paste it into your browser
* Jenkins login portal will be visible

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/login.png[]

* Please enter your Username ( default is user) and your password which you set at the deployment phase

image::tutorials/IBMCloud/welcome.png[]

You have succesfully deployed Jenkins on IBM Cloud!
