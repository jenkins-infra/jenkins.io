title: Build a Python app with PyInstaller
section: doc
---

:toc:
:toclevels: 3
:imagesdir: ../../book/resources

This tutorial shows you how to use Jenkins to orchestrate building a simple
Python application with https://www.pyinstaller.org/[PyInstaller].

If you are a Python developer who is new to CI/CD concepts, or you might be
familiar with these concepts but don't know how to implement building your
application using Jenkins, then this tutorial is for you.

The simple Python application (which you'll obtain from a sample repository on
GitHub) is a command line tool "add2vals" that outputs the addition of two
values. If at least one of the values is a string, "add2vals" treats both values
as a string and instead concatenates the values. The "add2" function in the
"calc" library (which "add2vals" imports) is accompanied by a set of unit tests.
These are tested with pytest to check that this function works as expected and
the results are saved to a JUnit XML report.

The delivery of the "add2vals" tool through PyInstaller converts this tool into
a standalone executable file for Linux, which you can download through Jenkins
and execute at the command line on Linux machines without Python.

*Note:* Unlike the link:..[other tutorials] in this documentation, this tutorial
requires approximately 500 MB more Docker image data to be downloaded.

*Duration:* This tutorial takes 20-40 minutes to complete (assuming you've
already met the <<prerequisites,prerequisites>> below). The exact duration will
depend on the speed of your machine and whether or not you've already
<<run-jenkins-in-docker,run Jenkins in Docker>> from link:..[another tutorial].

You can stop this tutorial at any point in time and continue from where you left
off.

If you've already run though link:..[another tutorial], you can skip the
<<prerequisites,Prerequisites>> and <<run-jenkins-in-docker,Run Jenkins in
Docker>> sections below and proceed on to <<fork-sample-repository,forking the
sample repository>>. (Just ensure you have
link:https://git-scm.com/downloads[Git] installed locally.) If you need to
restart Jenkins, simply follow the restart instructions in
<<stopping-and-restarting-jenkins,Stopping and restarting Jenkins>> and then
proceed on.

[[fork-sample-repository]]
=== Fork and clone the sample repository on GitHub

Obtain the simple "add" Python application from GitHub, by forking the sample
repository of the application's source code into your own GitHub account and
then cloning this fork locally.

. Ensure you are signed in to your GitHub account. If you don't yet have a
  GitHub account, sign up for a free one on the https://github.com/[GitHub
  website].
. Fork the
  https://github.com/jenkins-docs/simple-python-pyinstaller-app[`simple-python-pyinstaller-app`]
  on GitHub into your local GitHub account. If you need help with this process,
  refer to the https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/[Fork A Repo]
  documentation on the GitHub website for more information.
. Clone your forked `simple-python-pyinstaller-app` repository (on GitHub)
  locally to your machine. To begin this process, do either of the following
  (where `<your-username>` is the name of your user account on your operating
  system):
** If you have the GitHub Desktop app installed on your machine:
.. In GitHub, click the green *Clone or download* button on your forked
   repository, then *Open in Desktop*.
.. In GitHub Desktop, before clicking *Clone* on the *Clone a Repository* dialog
   box, ensure *Local Path* for:
*** macOS is `/Users/<your-username>/Documents/GitHub/simple-python-pyinstaller-app`
*** Linux is `/home/<your-username>/GitHub/simple-python-pyinstaller-app`
*** Windows is `C:\Users\<your-username>\Documents\GitHub\simple-python-pyinstaller-app`
** Otherwise:
.. Open up a terminal/command line prompt and `cd` to the appropriate directory
   on:
*** macOS - `/Users/<your-username>/Documents/GitHub/`
*** Linux - `/home/<your-username>/GitHub/`
*** Windows - `C:\Users\<your-username>\Documents\GitHub\` (although use a Git
    bash command line window as opposed to the usual Microsoft command prompt)
.. Run the following command to continue/complete cloning your forked repo: +
   `git clone \https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-ACCOUNT-NAME/simple-python-pyinstaller-app` +
   where `YOUR-GITHUB-ACCOUNT-NAME` is the name of your GitHub account.


=== Create your Pipeline project in Jenkins

. Go back to Jenkins, log in again if necessary and click *create new jobs*
  under *Welcome to Jenkins!* +
  *Note:* If you don't see this, click *New Item* at the top left.
. In the *Enter an item name* field, specify the name for your new Pipeline
  project (e.g. `simple-python-pyinstaller-app`).
. Scroll down and click *Pipeline*, then click *OK* at the end of the page.
. ( _Optional_ ) On the next page, specify a brief description for your Pipeline
  in the *Description* field (e.g. `An entry-level Pipeline demonstrating how to
  use Jenkins to build a simple Python application with PyInstaller.`)
. Click the *Pipeline* tab at the top of the page to scroll down to the
  *Pipeline* section.
. From the *Definition* field, choose the *Pipeline script from SCM* option.
  This option instructs Jenkins to obtain your Pipeline from Source Control
  Management (SCM), which will be your locally cloned Git repository.
. From the *SCM* field, choose *Git*.
. In the *Repository URL* field, specify the directory path of your locally
  cloned repository <<fork-sample-repository,above>>,
  which is from your user account/home directory on your host machine, mapped to
  the `/home` directory of the Jenkins container - i.e.
* For macOS - `/home/Documents/GitHub/simple-python-pyinstaller-app`
* For Linux - `/home/GitHub/simple-python-pyinstaller-app`
* For Windows - `/home/Documents/GitHub/simple-python-pyinstaller-app`
. Click *Save* to save your new Pipeline project. You're now ready to begin
  creating your `Jenkinsfile`, which you'll be checking into your locally cloned
  Git repository.


=== Create your initial Pipeline as a Jenkinsfile

You're now ready to create your Pipeline that will automate building your Python
application with PyInstaller in Jenkins. Your Pipeline will be created as a
`Jenkinsfile`, which will be committed to your locally cloned Git repository
(`simple-python-pyinstaller-app`).

This is the foundation of "Pipeline-as-Code", which treats the continuous
delivery pipeline a part of the application to be versioned and reviewed like
any other code. Read more about Pipeline and what a Jenkinsfile is in the
link:/doc/book/pipeline[Pipeline] and link:/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile[Using
a Jenkinsfile] sections of the User Handbook.

First, create an initial Pipeline with a "Build" stage that executes the first
part of the entire production process for your application. This "Build" stage
downloads a Python Docker image and runs it as a Docker container, which in turn
compiles your simple Python application into byte code.

. Using your favorite text editor or IDE, create and save new text file with the
  name `Jenkinsfile` at the root of your local `simple-python-pyinstaller-app`
  Git repository.
. Copy the following Declarative Pipeline code and paste it into your empty
  `Jenkinsfile`:
+
[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
    agent none // <1>
    stages {
        stage('Build') { // <2>
            agent {
                docker {
                    image 'python:2-alpine' // <3>
                }
            }
            steps {
                sh 'python -m py_compile sources/add2vals.py sources/calc.py' // <4>
            }
        }
    }
}
----
<1> The link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax#agent[`agent`] section with the `none`
parameter specified at the top of this Pipeline code block means that no global
agent will be allocated for the entire Pipeline's execution and that each
link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#stage[`stage`] directive must specify its own
`agent` section.
<2> Defines a link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#stage[`stage`] (directive) called
`Build` that appears on the Jenkins UI.
<3> This `image` parameter (of the link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax#agent[`agent`]
section's `docker` parameter) downloads the
https://hub.docker.com/_/python/[`python:2-alpine` Docker image] (if it's not
already available on your machine) and runs this image as a separate container.
This means that:
* You'll have separate Jenkins and Python containers running locally in Docker.
* The Python container becomes the link:/doc/book/glossary/#agent[agent] that
  Jenkins uses to run the `Build` stage of your Pipeline project. However,
  this container is short-lived - its lifespan is only that of the duration of
  your `Build` stage's execution.
<4> This
link:/doc/pipeline/steps/workflow-durable-task-step/#code-sh-code-shell-script[`sh`]
step (of the link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#steps[`steps`] section) runs the
Python command to compile your application and its `calc` library into byte code
files (each with `.pyc` extension), which are placed into the `sources`
workspace directory (within the
`/var/jenkins_home/workspace/simple-python-pyinstaller-app` directory in the
Jenkins container).
. Save your edited `Jenkinsfile` and commit it to your local
  `simple-python-pyinstaller-app` Git repository. E.g. Within the
  `simple-python-pyinstaller-app` directory, run the commands: +
  `git add .` +
  then +
  `git commit -m "Add initial Jenkinsfile"`
. Go back to Jenkins again, log in again if necessary and click *Open Blue
  Ocean* on the left to access Jenkins's Blue Ocean interface.
. In the *This job has not been run* message box, click *Run*, then quickly
  click the *OPEN* link which appears briefly at the lower-right to see Jenkins
  running your Pipeline project. If you weren't able to click the *OPEN* link,
  click the row on the main Blue Ocean interface to access this feature. +
  *Note:* You may need to wait a few minutes for this first run to complete.
  After making a clone of your local `simple-python-pyinstaller-app` Git
  repository itself, Jenkins:
.. Initially queues the project to be run on the agent.
.. Downloads the Python Docker image and runs it in a container on Docker.
+
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/python-pyinstaller-01-downloading-python-docker-image.png[alt="Downloading
Python Docker image",width=100%]
.. Runs the `Build` stage (defined in the `Jenkinsfile`) on the Python
   container. During this time, Python uses the `py_compile` module to compile
   the code of your Python application and its `calc` library into byte code,
   which are stored in the `sources` workspace directory (within the Jenkins
   home directory).

+
The Blue Ocean interface turns green if Jenkins compiled your Python application
successfully.

=== Add a test stage to your Pipeline

. Go back to your text editor/IDE and ensure your `Jenkinsfile` is open.
. Copy and paste the following Declarative Pipeline syntax immediately under the
  `Build` stage of your `Jenkinsfile`:
+
[source,groovy]
----
        stage('Test') {
            agent {
                docker {
                    image 'qnib/pytest'
                }
            }
            steps {
                sh 'py.test --verbose --junit-xml test-reports/results.xml sources/test_calc.py'
            }
            post {
                always {
                    junit 'test-reports/results.xml'
                }
            }
        }
----
so that you end up with:
+
[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
    agent none
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            agent {
                docker {
                    image 'python:2-alpine'
                }
            }
            steps {
                sh 'python -m py_compile sources/add2vals.py sources/calc.py'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') { // <1>
            agent {
                docker {
                    image 'qnib/pytest' // <2>
                }
            }
            steps {
                sh 'py.test --verbose --junit-xml test-reports/results.xml sources/test_calc.py' // <3>
            }
            post {
                always {
                    junit 'test-reports/results.xml' // <4>
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
----
<1> Defines a link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#stage[`stage`] (directive) called
`Test` that appears on the Jenkins UI.
<2> This `image` parameter (of the link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax#agent[`agent`]
section's `docker` parameter) downloads the
https://hub.docker.com/r/qnib/pytest/[`qnib:pytest` Docker image] (if it's not
already available on your machine) and runs this image as a separate container.
This means that:
* You'll have separate Jenkins and pytest containers running locally in Docker.
* The pytest container becomes the link:/doc/book/glossary/#agent[agent] that
  Jenkins uses to run the `Test` stage of your Pipeline project. This
  container's lifespan lasts the duration of your `Test` stage's execution.
<3> This
link:/doc/pipeline/steps/workflow-durable-task-step/#code-sh-code-shell-script[`sh`]
step (of the link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#steps[`steps`] section) executes
pytest's `py.test` command on `sources/test_calc.py`, which runs a set of unit
tests (defined in `test_calc.py`) on the "calc" library's `add2` function (used
by your simple Python application `add2vals`). The:
* `--verbose` option makes `py.test` generate verbose output in the Jenkins/Blue
  Ocean interface.
* `--junit-xml test-reports/results.xml` option makes `py.test` generate a JUnit
  XML report, which is saved to `test-reports/results.xml` (within the
  `/var/jenkins_home/workspace/simple-python-pyinstaller-app` directory in the
  Jenkins container).
<4> This
link:/doc/pipeline/steps/junit/#code-junit-code-archive-junit-formatted-test-results[`junit`]
step (provided by the link:/doc/pipeline/steps/junit[JUnit Plugin]) archives the
JUnit XML report (generated by the `py.test` command above) and exposes the
results through the Jenkins interface. In Blue Ocean, the results are accessible
through the *Tests* page of a Pipeline run. The
link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#post[`post`] section's `always` condition that
contains this `junit` step ensures that the step is _always_ executed _at the
completion_ of the `Test` stage, regardless of the stage's outcome.
. Save your edited `Jenkinsfile` and commit it to your local
  `simple-python-pyinstaller-app` Git repository. E.g. Within the
  `simple-python-pyinstaller-app` directory, run the commands: +
  `git stage .` +
  then +
  `git commit -m "Add 'Test' stage"`
. Go back to Jenkins again, log in again if necessary and ensure you've accessed
  Jenkins's Blue Ocean interface.
. Click *Run* at the top left, then quickly click the *OPEN* link which appears
  briefly at the lower-right to see Jenkins running your amended Pipeline
  project. If you weren't able to click the **OPEN** link, click the _top_ row
  on the Blue Ocean interface to access this feature. +
  **Note:** It may take a few minutes for the `qnib:pytest` Docker image to
  download (if this hasn't already been done). +
  If your amended Pipeline ran successfully, here's what the Blue Ocean
  interface should look like. Notice the additional "Test" stage. You can click
  on the previous "Build" stage circle to access the output from that stage.

=== Add a final deliver stage to your Pipeline

. Go back to your text editor/IDE and ensure your `Jenkinsfile` is open.
. Copy and paste the following Declarative Pipeline syntax immediately under the
  `Test` stage of your `Jenkinsfile`:
+
[source,groovy]
----
        stage('Deliver') {
            agent {
                docker {
                    image 'cdrx/pyinstaller-linux:python2'
                }
            }
            steps {
                sh 'pyinstaller --onefile sources/add2vals.py'
            }
            post {
                success {
                    archiveArtifacts 'dist/add2vals'
                }
            }
        }
----
and add a `skipStagesAfterUnstable` option so that you end up with:
+
[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
    agent none
    options {
        skipStagesAfterUnstable()
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            agent {
                docker {
                    image 'python:2-alpine'
                }
            }
            steps {
                sh 'python -m py_compile sources/add2vals.py sources/calc.py'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            agent {
                docker {
                    image 'qnib/pytest'
                }
            }
            steps {
                sh 'py.test --verbose --junit-xml test-reports/results.xml sources/test_calc.py'
            }
            post {

----
<1> Defines a link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#stage[`stage`] (directive) called
`Deliver` that appears on the Jenkins UI.
<2> This `image` parameter (of the link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax#agent[`agent`]
section's `docker` parameter) downloads the
https://hub.docker.com/r/cdrx/pyinstaller-linux/[`cdrx/pyinstaller-linux` Docker
image] (if it's not already available on your machine) and runs this image as a
separate container. This means that:
* You'll have separate Jenkins and PyInstaller (for Linux) containers running
  locally in Docker.
* The PyInstaller container becomes the link:/doc/book/glossary/#agent[agent]
  that Jenkins uses to run the `Deliver` stage of your Pipeline project. This
  container's lifespan lasts the duration of your `Deliver` stage's execution.
<3> This
link:/doc/pipeline/steps/workflow-durable-task-step/#code-sh-code-shell-script[`sh`]
step (of the link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#steps[`steps`] section) executes
the `pyinstaller` command (in the PyInstaller container) on your simple Python
application. This bundles your `add2vals.py` Python application into a single
standalone executable file (via the `--onefile` option) and outputs the this
file to the `dist` workspace directory (within the Jenkins home directory).
Although this step consists of a single command, as a general principle, it's a
good idea to keep your Pipeline code (i.e. the `Jenkinsfile`) as tidy as
possible and place more complex build steps (particularly for stages consisting
of 2 or more steps) into separate shell script files like the `deliver.sh` file.
This ultimately makes maintaining your Pipeline code easier, especially if your
Pipeline gains more complexity.
<4> This
link:/doc/pipeline/steps/workflow-basic-steps/#code-archive-code-archive-artifacts[`archiveArtifacts`]
step (provided as part of Jenkins core) archives the standalone executable file
(generated by the `pyinstaller` command above at `dist/add2vals` within the
Jenkins home's workspace directory) and exposes this file through the Jenkins
interface. In Blue Ocean, archived artifacts like these are accessible through
the *Artifacts* page of a Pipeline run. The
link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#post[`post`] section's `success` condition that
contains this `archiveArtifacts` step ensures that the step is executed _at the
completion_ of the `Deliver` stage _only if_ this stage completed successfully.
. Save your edited `Jenkinsfile` and commit it to your local
  `simple-python-pyinstaller-app` Git repository. E.g. Within the
  `simple-python-pyinstaller-app` directory, run the commands: +
  `git stage .` +
  then +
  `git commit -m "Add 'Deliver' stage"`
. Go back to Jenkins again, log in again if necessary and ensure you've accessed
  Jenkins's Blue Ocean interface.
. Click *Run* at the top left, then quickly click the *OPEN* link which appears
  briefly at the lower-right to see Jenkins running your amended Pipeline
  project. If you weren't able to click the **OPEN** link, click the _top_ row
  on the Blue Ocean interface to access this feature. +
  **Note:** It may take a few minutes for the `cdrx/pyinstaller-linux` Docker
  image to download (if this hasn't already been done). +

=== Follow up (optional)

If you use Linux, you can try running the standalone `add2vals` application you
generated with PyInstaller locally on your machine. To do this:

. From the main Blue Ocean interface, access your last Pipeline run you
  performed <<add-a-final-deliver-stage-to-your-pipeline,above>>. To do this,
  click the top row (representing the most recent Pipeline run) on the main Blue
  Ocean's *Activity* page.
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/python-pyinstaller-23-main-blue-ocean-interface-with-all-previous-runs-displayed.png[alt="Main
Blue Ocean interface with all previous runs displayed",width=100%]

  to access the *Artifacts* page.
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/python-pyinstaller-21-deliver-stage-runs-successfully.png[alt="Deliver

. In the list of artifacts, click the down-arrow icon at the far right of the
  *dist/add2vals* artifact item to download the standalone executable file to
  your browser's "Downloads" directory.
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/python-pyinstaller-24-deliver-stage-artifacts-page.png[alt="Deliver

. Back in your operating system's terminal prompt, `cd` to your browser's
  "Downloads" directory.
. Make the `add2vals` file executable - i.e. `chmod a+x add2vals`
. Run the command `./add2vals` and follow the instructions provided by your app.


=== Wrapping up

Well done! You've just used Jenkins to build a simple Python application!

The "Build", "Test" and "Deliver" stages you created above are the basis for
building more complex Python applications in Jenkins, as well as Python
applications that integrate with other technology stacks.

Because Jenkins is extremely extensible, it can be modified and configured to
handle practically any aspect of build orchestration and automation.
