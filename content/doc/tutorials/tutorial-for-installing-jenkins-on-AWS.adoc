Jenkins is an open-source automation server that integrates with a number of
AWS Services, such as AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeDeploy, Amazon EC2 Spot,
and Amazon EC2 Fleet.
You can use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon
EC2) to deploy a Jenkins application on AWS in a matter of minutes.

This tutorial walks you through the process of deploying a Jenkins application.
You will launch an EC2 instance, install Jenkins on that instance, and configure
Jenkins to automatically spin up Jenkins agents if build abilities
need to be augmented on the instance.

In this tutorial, you will perform the following steps:

1. <<Prerequisites>>
2. <<Create a key pair>> using Amazon EC2 if you already
have one, you can skip this step
3. <<Create a security group>> for your Amazon EC2 instance if you already
have one, you can skip this step
4. <<Launch an Amazon EC2 instance>>
5. <<Install and configure Jenkins>>
6. <<Clean up>>

== Prerequisites

1. An AWS account, if you don't have one, you can register link:https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start[here]
2. An Amazon EC2 key pair, if you don't have one, see the <<Create a key pair using Amazon EC2>> section.

== Create a key pair

To create your key pair:

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/ and sign in.

2. In the navigation pane, under **NETWORK & SECURITY**, choose **Key Pairs**.

3. Select **Create key pair**.

4. For **Name**, enter a descriptive name for the key pair. Amazon EC2 associates the public key with the name that you specify as the key name. A key name can include up to 255 ASCII characters. It canâ€™t include leading or trailing spaces.

5. For **File format**, choose the format in which to save the private key. To save the private key in a format that can be used with OpenSSH, choose **pem**. To save the private key in a format that can be used with PuTTY, choose **ppk**.

6. Select **Create key pair**.

7. The private key file is automatically downloaded by your browser. The base file name is the name you specified as the name of your key pair, and the file name extension is determined by the file format you chose. Save the private key file in a safe place.
+
NOTE: This is the only chance for you to save the private key file.
+
8. If you will use an SSH client on a macOS or Linux computer to connect to your Linux instance, use the following command to set the permissions of your private key file so that only you can read it.

[source,bash]
----
$ chmod 400 <key_pair_name>.pem
----

NOTE: If you do not set these permissions, then you cannot connect to your instance using this key pair. For more information, see link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesConnecting.html#troubleshoot-unprotected-key[Error: Unprotected private key file].

== Create a security group

A security group acts as a firewall that controls the traffic allowed to reach
one or more EC2 instances.
When you launch an instance, you can assign it one or more security groups.
You add rules to each security group that control the traffic allowed to reach the
instances in the security group.
Note that you can modify the rules for a security group at any time; the new
rules take effect immediately.

For this tutorial, you will create a security group and add the following rules:
* Allow inbound HTTP access from anywhere.
* Allow inbound SSH traffic from your computer's public IP address so
that you can connect to your instance.

**To create and configure your security group:**

* Decide who may access your instance, for example, a single computer or
all trusted computers on a network. For this tutorial, you can use the
public IP address of your computer. To find your IP address, use the
link:http://checkip.amazonaws.com/[checkip service] from AWS3 or search for the
phrase "what is my IP address" in any Internet search engine.
If you are connecting through an ISP or from behind your firewall
without a static IP address, you will need to find the range of IP
addresses used by client computers.
If you don't know this address range, you can use 0.0.0.0/0 for this tutorial.
However, this is unsafe for production environments because it allows everyone to
access your instance using SSH.

* Sign in to the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/[AWS Management Console].
* Open the Amazon EC2 console by choosing EC2 under Compute.

image::tutorials/AWS/ec2_service.png[]

* In the left-hand navigation bar, choose **Security Groups**, and then click
**Create Security Group**.

image::tutorials/AWS/create_security_group.png[]

* In **Security group name** enter *WebServerSG* or any preferred name of your choice and provide a description.
* Choose your VPC from the list, you can use the default VPC.
* On the **Inbound tab**, add the rules as follows:
** Click **Add Rule**, and then choose **SSH** from the Type list. Under
**Source**, select **Custom** and in the text box enter <public IP
address range that you decided on in step 1>/32 i.e 172.23.23.165/32.
** Click **Add Rule**, and then choose **HTTP** from the Type list.
** Click **Add Rule**, and then choose **Custom TCP Rule** from the
Type list. Under **Port Range** enter **8080**.
* Click Create.

For more information, see link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html[Security Groups] in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for
Linux Instances.

== Launch an Amazon EC2 instance

To launch an EC2 instance:

* Sign in to the the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/[AWS Management Console].
* Open the Amazon EC2 console by choosing EC2 under Compute.
* From the Amazon EC2 dashboard, choose Launch Instance.

image::tutorials/AWS/ec2_launch_instance.png[]

* The Choose an **Amazon Machine Image (AMI)** page displays a list of basic configurations called Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) that serve as templates for your instance. Select the HVM edition of the **Amazon Linux AMI**. Notice that this configuration is marked **Free tier eligible**.

image::tutorials/AWS/ec2_choose_ami.png[]

* On the **Choose an Instance Type page**, the **t2.micro** instance is selected by default.
Keep this instance type to stay within the free tier. **Review and Launch**.

image::tutorials/AWS/ec2_choose_instance_type.png[]

* On the **Review Instance Launch page**, click **Edit security groups**.

image::tutorials/AWS/ec2_review_instance_launch.png[]

* On the Configure Security Group page:
** Select **Select an existing security group**.
** Select the **WebServerSG** security group that you created.
** Click **Review and Launch**.

image::tutorials/AWS/select_security_group.png[]

* On the **Review Instance Launch page**, click **Launch**.

image::tutorials/AWS/review_instance_launch.png[]

* In the **Select an existing key pair or create a new key pair** dialog
box, select **Choose an existing key pair**, and then select the key pair
you created in the <<Create a key pair using Amazon EC2>> section above or
any existing key pair you intend to use.

image::tutorials/AWS/select_key_pair.png[]

* In the left-hand navigation bar, choose **Instances** to see the status of
your instance.
Initially, the status of your instance is pending. After the
status changes to running, your instance is ready for use.

== Install and configure Jenkins

In this step you will deploy Jenkins on your EC2 instance by completing the
following tasks:

* <<Connect to Your Linux Instance>>
* <<Download and Install Jenkins>>
* <<Configure Jenkins>>

=== Connect to your Linux instance

After you launch your instance, you can connect to it and use it the way that you
would use your local machine.

Before you connect to your instance, get the **public DNS** name of the instance
using the Amazon EC2 console. Select the instance and locate Public DNS.

image::tutorials/AWS/ec2_public_dns.png[]

NOTE: If your instance doesn't have a public DNS name, open the VPC console, select
the VPC, and check the Summary tab. If either DNS resolution or DNS
hostnames is **no**, click **Edit** and change the value to **yes**.

==== Prerequisites

The tool that you use to connect to your Linux instance depends on the
operating system running on your computer.
If your computer runs Windows, you will connect using PuTTY.
If your computer runs Linux or Mac OS X, you will connect using the SSH client.
These tools require the use of your key pair.
Be sure that you created your key pair as described in <<Create a key pair using Amazon EC2>>.


==== Using PuTTY to connect to your instance

* From the **Start** menu, choose **All Programs** > **PuTTY** > **PuTTY**.
* In the Category pane, select **Session**, and complete the following fields:
** In **Host Name**, enter ec2-user@public_dns_name.
** Ensure that **Port** is 22.

image::tutorials/AWS/ec2_putty.png[]

* In the **Category** pane, expand **Connection**, expand **SSH**, and then
select **Auth**. Complete the following:
** Click Browse.
** Select the .ppk file that you generated for your key pair, as
described in <<Create a key pair using Amazon EC2>> and then click **Open**.
** Click Open to start the PuTTY session.

image::tutorials/AWS/putty_select_key_pair.png[]

==== Using SSH to connect to your instance

* Use the ssh command to connect to the instance.
You will specify the private key (.pem) file and ec2-user@public_dns_name.

[source,bash]
----
$ ssh -i /path/my-key-pair.pem ec2-user@ec2-198-51-
100-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com
----

You will see a response like the following:

[source,bash]
----
