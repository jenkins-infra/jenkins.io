Jenkins is an open-source automation server that integrates with a number of
AWS Services, including: AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeDeploy, Amazon EC2 Spot, and Amazon EC2 Fleet.
You can use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) to deploy a Jenkins application on AWS.

This tutorial walks you through the process of deploying a Jenkins application.
You will launch an EC2 instance, install Jenkins on that instance, and configure
Jenkins to automatically spin up Jenkins agents if build abilities
need to be augmented on the instance.

In this tutorial, you will perform the following steps:

. <<Prerequisites>>.
. <<Creating a key pair,Create a key pair>> using Amazon EC2.
If you already have one, you can skip to step 3.
. <<Creating a security group,Create a security group>> for your Amazon EC2 instance. If you already have one, you can skip to step 4.
. <<Launching an Amazon EC2 instance,Launch an Amazon EC2 instance>>.
. <<Installing and configuring Jenkins,Install and configure Jenkins>>.
. <<Cleaning up,Clean up tutorial resources>>.

== Prerequisites

. An *AWS account*. If you don't have one, you can register link:https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start[here].
. An Amazon EC2 key pair. If you don't have one, refer to <<Creating a key pair>>.
. An AWS IAM User with programmatic key access and link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/ec2/#plugin-content-iam-setup[permissions to launch EC2 instances]

== Creating a key pair

Creating a key pair helps ensure that the correct form of authentication is used when you install Jenkins.

To create your key pair:

. Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/ and sign in.

. In the navigation pane, under *NETWORK & SECURITY*, select *Key Pairs*.

. Select **Create key pair**.

. For *Name*, enter a descriptive name for the key pair.
Amazon EC2 associates the public key with the name that you specify as the *key name*.
A key name can include up to 255 ASCII characters.
It cannot include leading or trailing spaces.

. For *File format*, select the format in which to save the private key.
* For OpenSSH compatibility, select *pem*.
* For PuTTY compatibility, select *ppk*.

. Select *Create key pair*.

. The private key file downloads automatically.
The base file name is the name you specified as the name of your key pair, and the file name extension is determined by the file format you chose.
Save the private key file in a safe place.
+
IMPORTANT: This is the only chance for you to save the private key file.
+
. If you use an SSH client on a macOS or Linux computer to connect to your Linux instance, run the following command to set the permissions of your private key file so that only you can read it.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ chmod 400 <key_pair_name>.pem
----

NOTE: If you do not set these permissions, you cannot connect to your instance using this key pair. For more information, refer to link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/TroubleshootingInstancesConnecting.html#troubleshoot-unprotected-key[Error: Unprotected private key file].

== Creating a security group

A security group acts as a firewall that controls the traffic allowed to reach one or more EC2 instances.
When you launch an instance, you can assign it one or more security groups.
You add rules that control the traffic allowed to reach the instances in each security group.
You can modify a security group's rules any time, and the new rules take effect immediately.

For this tutorial, you will create a security group and add the following rules:

* Allow inbound HTTP access from anywhere.
* Allow inbound SSH traffic from your computer's public IP address so you can connect to your instance.

To create and configure your security group:

. [[step1-security-group]]Decide who may access your instance.
For example, a single computer or all trusted computers on a network.
For this tutorial, you can use the public IP address of your computer.
* To find your IP address, use the
link:http://checkip.amazonaws.com/[check IP service tool] from AWS3 or search for the phrase "what is my IP address" in any search engine.
* If you connect through an ISP or from behind your firewall without a static IP address, you will need the range of IP addresses used by client computers.
If you don't know this address range, you can use 0.0.0.0/0 for this tutorial.
+
IMPORTANT: This is unsafe for production environments because it allows everyone to
access your instance using SSH.

. Sign in to the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/[AWS Management Console].
. Open the Amazon EC2 console by selecting *EC2* under *Compute*.
+
image::tutorials/AWS/ec2_service.png[Amazon EC2 Services page]

. In the left-hand navigation bar, select **Security Groups**, and then select *Create Security Group*.
+
image::tutorials/AWS/create_security_group.png[Amazon security group creation screen]

. In **Security group name**, enter *WebServerSG* or any preferred name of your choice, and provide a description.
. Select your VPC from the list. You can use the default VPC.
. On the **Inbound tab**, add the rules as follows:
.. Select *Add Rule*, and then select *SSH* from the Type list.
.. Under *Source*, select *Custom*, and in the text box, enter <<step1-security-group,the IP address from step 1>>, followed by /32 indicating a single IP Address.
For example, 104.34.241.123/32 is a single IP address, while 198.51.100.2/24 results in a range of 256 IP addresses.
.. Select *Add Rule*, and then select *HTTP* from the Type list.
.. Select *Add Rule*, and then select *Custom TCP Rule* from the
Type list.
.. Under *Port Range*, enter *8080*.
. Select Create.

For more information, refer to link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html[Security Groups] in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for
Linux Instances.

== Launching an Amazon EC2 instance

Now that you have configured a key pair and security group, you can launch an EC2 instance.

To launch an EC2 instance:

. Sign in to the the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/[AWS Management Console].
. Open the Amazon EC2 console by selecting EC2 under *Compute*.
. From the Amazon EC2 dashboard, select *Launch Instance*.
+
image::tutorials/AWS/ec2_launch_instance.png[Launching from Amazon]

. The *Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)* page displays a list of basic configurations called Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) that serve as templates for your instance.
Select the HVM edition of the *Amazon Linux AMI*.
+
NOTE: This configuration is marked *Free tier eligible*.
+
image::tutorials/AWS/ec2_choose_ami.png[Choosing an Amazon Machine Image]

. Scroll down and select the key pair you created in the <<Creating a key pair, creating a key pair>> section above or any existing key pair you intend to use.
.. Select *Select an existing security group*.
.. Select the *WebServerSG* security group that you created.
.. Select *Launch Instance*.
+
image::tutorials/AWS/ec2_review_instance_launch.png[Review your Amazon launch instance]

. In the left-hand navigation bar, choose **Instances** to view the status of your instance.
Initially, the status of your instance is pending.
After the status changes to running, your instance is ready for use.

== Installing and configuring Jenkins

Now that the Amazon EC2 instance has been launched, Jenkins can be installed properly.

In this step you will deploy Jenkins on your EC2 instance by completing the following tasks:

. <<Connecting to your Linux instance>>
. <<Downloading and installing Jenkins>>
. <<Configuring Jenkins>>

=== Connecting to your Linux instance

After you launch your instance, you can connect to it and use it the same way as your local machine.

Before you connect to your instance, get the *public DNS* name of the instance using the Amazon EC2 console.

. Select the instance and locate Public DNS.
+
image::tutorials/AWS/ec2_public_dns.png[Amazon public DNS]

NOTE: If your instance doesn't have a public DNS name, open the VPC console, select the VPC, and check the *Summary* tab.
If either DNS resolution or DNS hostnames is *no*, select *Edit* and change the value to *yes*.

==== Prerequisites

The tool that you use to connect to your Linux instance depends on your operating system.

* If your computer runs Windows, you will connect using PuTTY.
* If your computer runs Linux or Mac OS X, you will connect using the SSH client.

These tools require the use of your key pair.
Be sure that you have created your key pair as described in <<Creating a key pair>>.


==== Using PuTTY to connect to your instance

. From the *Start* menu, select *All Programs* > *PuTTY* > *PuTTY*.
. In the *Category* pane, select *Session*, and complete the following fields:
.. In *Host Name*, enter ec2-user@public_dns_name.
.. Ensure that *Port* is 22.
