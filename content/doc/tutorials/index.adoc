This part of the Jenkins User Documentation contains a series of introductory
tutorials to help you begin building your project in an automated fashion with
Jenkins.

If you're a developer who wants to improve your understanding of Continuous
Integration (CI) / Continuous Delivery (CD) concepts, or you might already be
familiar with these concepts but don't yet know how to implement them in
Jenkins, then these tutorials are a great place to start.

Please choose the tutorial that's relvant to your technology stack:
