introductory tutorials to help you begin building your project in an automated
fashion with Jenkins.

If you're a developer with either little understanding of Continuous Integration
(CI) or Continuous Delivery (CD) concepts, or a developer who might be familiar
with these principles but don’t know how to implement them in Jenkins) then
these tutorials are a great place for you start.
