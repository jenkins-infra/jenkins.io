This tutorial shows you how to use Jenkins to orchestrate building and testing
a simple https://nodejs.org/en/[Node.js] and https://reactjs.org/[React]
application with the https://www.npmjs.com/[Node Package Manager (npm)], _as
well as_ deliver different outcomes for development and production purposes.

Before starting this tutorial, it is recommended that you run through at least
one of the initial set of link:../#introductory-tutorials[Introductory
tutorials] from the link:..[Tutorials overview] page first to familiarize
yourself with CI/CD concepts (relevant to a technology stack you're most
familiar with), how these concepts are implemented in Jenkins and the
fundamentals of Jenkins Pipelines.

In this tutorial, you'll use the same application that the
link:../build-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm[Build a Node.js and React app
with npm] tutorial is based on. Therefore, you'll be building and testing the
same application but this time, its delivery will be different depending on the
Git branch that Jenkins builds from. That is, the branch being built determines
which delivery stage of your Pipeline is executed.

*Duration:* This tutorial takes 30-50 minutes to complete (assuming you've
already met the <<prerequisites,Prerequisites>> below). The exact duration will
depend on the speed of your machine and whether or not you've already
<<run-jenkins-in-docker,run Jenkins in Docker>> from link:..[another tutorial].

You can stop this tutorial at any point in time and continue from where you left
off.

If you've already run though link:..[another tutorial], you can skip the
<<prerequisites,Prerequisites>> and <<run-jenkins-in-docker,Run Jenkins in
Docker>> sections below and proceed on to <<fork-sample-repository,forking the
sample repository>>. (Just ensure you have
link:https://git-scm.com/downloads[Git] installed locally.) If you need to
restart Jenkins, simply follow the restart instructions in
<<stopping-and-restarting-jenkins,Stopping and restarting Jenkins>> and then
proceed on.

[[fork-sample-repository]]
[[fork-and-clone-the-sample-repository-on-github]]
=== Fork and clone the sample repository

Obtain the simple "Welcome to React" Node.js and React application from GitHub,
by forking the sample repository of the application's source code into your own
GitHub account and then cloning this fork locally.

. Ensure you are signed in to your GitHub account. If you don't yet have a
  GitHub account, sign up for a free one on the https://github.com/[GitHub
  website].
. Fork the
  https://github.com/jenkins-docs/building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project[`building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project`]
  on GitHub into your local GitHub account. If you need help with this process,
  refer to the https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/[Fork A Repo]
  documentation on the GitHub website for more information.
. Clone your forked `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` repository (on
  GitHub) locally to your machine. To begin this process, do either of the
  following (where `<your-username>` is the name of your user account on your
  operating system):
** If you have the GitHub Desktop app installed on your machine:
.. In GitHub, click the green *Clone or download* button on your forked
   repository, then *Open in Desktop*.
.. In GitHub Desktop, before clicking *Clone* on the *Clone a Repository* dialog
   box, ensure *Local Path* for:
*** macOS is `/Users/<your-username>/Documents/GitHub/building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project`
*** Linux is `/home/<your-username>/GitHub/building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project`
*** Windows is `C:\Users\<your-username>\Documents\GitHub\building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project`
** Otherwise:
.. Open up a terminal/command line prompt and `cd` to the appropriate directory
   on:
*** macOS - `/Users/<your-username>/Documents/GitHub/`
*** Linux - `/home/<your-username>/GitHub/`
*** Windows - `C:\Users\<your-username>\Documents\GitHub\` (although use a Git
    bash command line window as opposed to the usual Microsoft command prompt)
.. Run the following command to continue/complete cloning your forked repo: +
   `git clone \https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-ACCOUNT-NAME/building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` +
   where `YOUR-GITHUB-ACCOUNT-NAME` is the name of your GitHub account.


=== Create development and production branches in your repository

Before creating your Pipeline project in Jenkins, create "development" and
"production" branches of your locally cloned Git repository. You'll be creating
a single Jenkinsfile (initially in the `master` branch, which you'll pull into
the other branches) whose stages will be selectively executed based on the
branch that Jenkins is building from.

Within the `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` directory (i.e. your local
clone of the sample repository):

. Run the following commands to create
  these branches (from the contents of the `master` branch):
* `git branch development` +
  and
* `git branch production`
. Check that these branches now exist by running the command `git branch`, which
  should give you:
+
[source,bash]
----
  development
* master
  production
----
. If the asterisk (indicating the current branch) does not appear next to
  `master`, run the command `git checkout master` to ensure that `master` is the
  current branch.


=== Create your Pipeline project in Blue Ocean

Whenever you create _any_ Pipeline project in Blue Ocean, Jenkins actually
creates this as a multibranch Pipeline project behind the scenes. This becomes
apparent if you were to access Jenkins's classic interface after creating a
Pipeline project in Blue Ocean; you'll see that Jenkins will have created your
project as a "Multibranch Pipeline" project.

. Go back to Jenkins and ensure you have accessed the Blue Ocean interface. To
  do this, make sure you:
* have browsed to `\http://localhost:8080/blue` and are logged in +
  or
* have browsed to `\http://localhost:8080/`, are logged in and have clicked *Open
  Blue Ocean* on the left.
. In the *Welcome to Jenkins* box at the center of the Blue Ocean interface,
  click *Create a new Pipeline* to begin the Pipeline creation wizard. +
  *Note:* If you don't see this box, click *New Pipeline* at the top right.
. In *Where do you store your code?*, click *Git* (_not_ *GitHub*).
. In the *Repository URL* field (within *Connect to a Git repository*), specify
  the directory path of your locally cloned repository
  <<fork-sample-repository,above>>, which is from your
  user account/home directory on your host machine, mapped to the `/home`
  directory of the Jenkins container - i.e.
* For macOS - `/home/Documents/GitHub/building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project`
* For Linux - `/home/GitHub/building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project`
* For Windows - `/home/Documents/GitHub/building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project`
. Click *Save* to save your new Pipeline project. +
  Blue Ocean detects the presence of the `Jenkinsfile` "Pipeline stub" in each
  branch and proceeds to run each Pipeline against its respective branch, whose
  build results are shown on the *Activity* page of the main Blue Ocean
  interface.
+
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline-01-main-blueocean-interface.png[alt="Main
Blue Ocean interface",width=100%]

[NOTE]
====
The Pipeline stub consists of the basic requirements for a valid Pipeline - i.e.
an link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax#agent[`agent`] and a
link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax#stages[`stages`] section, as well as a
link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax#stage[`stage`] directive.

The reason why the `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` repository includes
a `Jenkinsfile` Pipeline stub is that its presence in a branch makes Blue Ocean
detect that there's something to build (i.e. the `Jenkinsfile`) immediately
after creating the Pipeline project in Blue Ocean, which in turn makes these
branches accessible through the Blue Ocean interface.

If you created a Pipeline project in Blue Ocean but didn't have a Jenkinsfile in
one or more of your repository's branches, then to access the branches in Blue
Ocean after subsequently pulling in/adding a `Jenkinsfile` to these branches,
either:

* Use the *Scan Multibranch Pipeline Now* feature in the Multibranch Pipeline
  project (accessible through Jenkins's classic interface), +
  or
* Implement webhooks into your Git repository.
====


=== Create your initial Pipeline as a Jenkinsfile with build and test stages

You're now ready to create the Pipeline that will automate building your Node.js
and React application in Jenkins. Your Pipeline will be created as a
`Jenkinsfile`, which will be committed to the `master` branch of your locally
cloned Git repository (`building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project`).

First, create an initial Pipeline to download a Node Docker image and run it as
a Docker container that will build your simple Node.js and React application.
Also add a "Build" stage to the Pipeline to begin orchestrating this whole
process and a "Test" stage to check that the application renders satisfactorily.

. Using your favorite text editor or IDE, open the existing `Jenkinsfile` at the
  root of your local `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` Git repository
  and _clear_ its contents. +
  *Note:* Be sure you are performing this step on the `master` branch of your
  repository.
. Copy the following Declarative Pipeline code and paste it into your empty
  `Jenkinsfile`:
+
[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker {
            image 'node:20.11.1-alpine3.19'
            args '-p 3000:3000 -p 5000:5000' // <1>
        }
    }
    environment {
        CI = 'true'
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm install'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh './jenkins/scripts/test.sh'
            }
        }
    }
}
----
<1> This `args` parameter makes the Node container (temporarily) accessible
through ports 3000 and 5000. The significance of this is explained in the
`jenkins/scripts/deliver-for-deployment.sh` and
`jenkins/scripts/deploy-for-production.sh` files of your cloned repository, and
are covered in subsequent sections of this tutorial.
+
*Note:* For an explanation of the other components of this `Jenkinsfile`, refer
to the annotations of the Declarative Pipeline in the
link:../build-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm/#create-your-initial-pipeline-as-a-jenkinsfile[``Create
your initial Pipeline...''] and
link:../build-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm/#add-a-test-stage-to-your-pipeline[``Add
a test stage...''] sections of the
link:../build-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm/[Build a Node.js and React app
with npm] tutorial.
. Save your edited `Jenkinsfile` and commit it to your local
  `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` Git repository. E.g. Within the
  `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` directory, run the commands: +
  `git stage .` +
  then +
  `git commit -m "Add initial Jenkinsfile with 'Test' stage"`
. Go back to Jenkins again, log in again if necessary and ensure you've accessed
  Jenkins's Blue Ocean interface.
. Click *Branches* at the top right to access the list of your Pipeline
  project's branches.
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline-11-branches-page.png[alt="Branches
page",width=100%]
. Click the run icon
  image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline-12-run-icon.png[alt="Run icon",width=3%]
  of the `master` branch of your Pipeline project, then quickly click the *OPEN*
  link that appears briefly at the lower-right to see Jenkins building the
  `master` branch with the amended `Jenkinsfile`. If you weren't able to click
  the **OPEN** link, click the _top_ row on the Blue Ocean *Activity* page to
  access this feature. +
  Within a few minutes, the Blue Ocean interface turns green if Jenkins built
  your Node.js and React application successfully from your `master` branch.
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline-13-build-and-test-stages-run-successfully-with-output.png[alt="Build
and test stages run successfully with output",width=100%]
. Click the *X* at the top-right to return to the *Activity* page of the Blue
  Ocean interface.


=== Add deliver and deploy stages to your Pipeline

Next, add "Deliver for development" and "Deploy for production" stages to your
Pipeline, which Jenkins will selectively execute based on the branch that Jenkins is building from.

This takes the "Pipeline-as-Code" concept to a new level, in which a single
`Jenkinsfile` describes your project's entire build, test, delivery and
deployment processes in Jenkins for each branch of your repository. Read more
about Pipeline and what a Jenkinsfile is in the
link:/doc/book/pipeline[Pipeline] and link:/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile[Using
a Jenkinsfile] sections of the User Handbook.

. Go back to your text editor/IDE and ensure your `Jenkinsfile` is open.
. Copy and paste the following Declarative Pipeline syntax immediately under the
  `Test` stage of your `Jenkinsfile`:
+
[source,groovy]
----
        stage('Deliver for development') {
            when {
                branch 'development'
            }
            steps {
                sh './jenkins/scripts/deliver-for-development.sh'
                input message: 'Finished using the web site? (Click "Proceed" to continue)'
                sh './jenkins/scripts/kill.sh'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy for production') {
            when {
                branch 'production'
            }
            steps {
                sh './jenkins/scripts/deploy-for-production.sh'
                input message: 'Finished using the web site? (Click "Proceed" to continue)'
                sh './jenkins/scripts/kill.sh'
            }
        }
----
so that you end up with:
+
[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker {
            image 'node:20.11.1-alpine3.19'
            args '-p 3000:3000 -p 5000:5000'
        }
    }
    environment {
        CI = 'true'
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm install'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh './jenkins/scripts/test.sh'
            }
        }
        stage('Deliver for development') {
            when {
                branch 'development' // <1>
            }
            steps {
                sh './jenkins/scripts/deliver-for-development.sh'
                input message: 'Finished using the web site? (Click "Proceed" to continue)'
                sh './jenkins/scripts/kill.sh'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy for production') {
            when {
                branch 'production'  // <1>
            }
            steps {
                sh './jenkins/scripts/deploy-for-production.sh'
                input message: 'Finished using the web site? (Click "Proceed" to continue)'
                sh './jenkins/scripts/kill.sh'
            }
        }
    }
}
----
<1> These link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax#when[`when`] directives (along with
their `branch` conditions) determine whether or not the
link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax#stage[`stages`] (containing these `when`
directives) should be executed. If a `branch` condition's value (i.e. pattern)
matches the name of the branch that Jenkins is running the build from, then the
`stage` that contains this `when` and `branch` construct will be executed.
+
*Notes:*
* For an explanation of the `input message` steps, refer to annotation *4* of
  the Declarative Pipeline at the
  link:../build-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm/#add-a-final-deliver-stage-to-your-pipeline[``Add
  a final deliver stage...'' section of the Build a Node.js and React app]
  tutorial.
* For an explanation of the `deliver-for-development.sh`,
  `deploy-for-production.sh` and `kill.sh` script steps, refer to the contents
  of these files located in the `jenkins/scripts` directory from the root of the
  `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` repository.
. Save your edited `Jenkinsfile` and commit it to your local
  `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` Git repository. E.g. Within the
  `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` directory, run the commands: +
  `git stage .` +
  then +
  `git commit -m "Add 'Deliver...' and 'Deploy...' stages"`
. Go back to Jenkins again, log in again if necessary and ensure you've accessed
  Jenkins's Blue Ocean interface.
. Click *Branches* at the top right to access the list of your Pipeline
  project's branches.
. Click the run icon
  image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline-12-run-icon.png[alt="Run icon",width=3%]
  of the `master` branch of your Pipeline project, then quickly click the *OPEN*
  link that appears briefly at the lower-right to see Jenkins building the
  `master` branch with the amended `Jenkinsfile`. If you weren't able to click
  the **OPEN** link, click the _top_ row on the Blue Ocean *Activity* page to
  access this feature. +
  Notice how Jenkins skips the last two stages you added, since the branch you
  are running the build from (`master`) does not meet the `when` directives'
  `branch` conditions in these stages.
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline-21-complete-pipeline-runs-successfully-on-master-branch.png[alt="Complete
Pipeline runs successfully on the 'master' branch",width=100%]
. Click the *X* at the top-right to return to the *Activity* page of the Blue
  Ocean interface.


=== Pull your updated Jenkinsfile into the other repository branches

Now that you have a completed `Jenkinsfile` to build your application in
Jenkins, you can pull this file from the `master` branch of your local
repository into its `development` and `production` branches.

Within your local repository's `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project`
directory:

. Run the following commands to pull changes from `master` to
  `development`:
* `git checkout development` +
  and
* `git pull . master`
. Also run the following commands to pull changes from `master` to `production`:
* `git checkout production` +
  and
* `git pull . master`

+
Your `development` and `production` branches should now have all your
`Jenkinsfile` updates you made on the `master` branch.


=== Run your Pipeline on the development branch

. Go back to Jenkins again, log in again if necessary and ensure you've accessed
  Jenkins's Blue Ocean interface.
. Click *Branches* at the top right to access the list of your Pipeline
  project's branches.
. Click the run icon
  image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline-12-run-icon.png[alt="Run icon",width=3%]
  of the `development` branch of your Pipeline project, then quickly click the
  *OPEN* link that appears briefly at the lower-right to see Jenkins building
  the `development` branch with the amended `Jenkinsfile`. If you weren't able
  to click the **OPEN** link, click the _top_ row on the Blue Ocean *Activity*
  page to access this feature.
. Within a few minutes and when the build pauses, ensure you are viewing the
  *Deliver for development* stage (click it if necessary), then click the top
  green *Shell Script* step to expand its contents and scroll down until you see
  the `\http://localhost:3000` link.
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline-31-deliver-for-development-stage-opened.png[alt="Shell
Script step 'Deliver for development' stage opened",width=100%] +
  *Note:* Since you are building the application on a different branch, the `npm
  install` step will require a few minutes for `npm` to download the many
  dependencies required to run your Node.js and React application (stored in a
  local `node_modules` directory within the Jenkins home directory). These
  dependencies are downloaded again because this Jenkins build would be the
  first time you are running your Pipeline project on the `development` branch
  and each branch has its own workspace directory (containing its own
  `node_modules` directory) within the Jenkins home directory.
. Click the `\http://localhost:3000` link to view your Node.js and React
  application running in development mode (with the `npm start` command) in a
  new web browser tab. You should see a page/site with the title *Welcome to
  React* on it.
. When you are finished viewing the page/site, click the *Proceed* button in
  Blue Ocean to complete the Pipeline's execution. +
  The Blue Ocean interface turns green if Jenkins built your Node.js and React
  application successfully from your `development` branch. Notice how the
  *Deliver for development* stage was executed but the *Deploy for production*
  stage was not.
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline-32-complete-pipeline-runs-successfully-on-development-branch.png[alt="Complete

. Click the *X* at the top-right to return to the *Activity* page of the Blue
  Ocean interface.


=== Run your Pipeline on the production branch

. Click *Branches* at the top right to access the list of your Pipeline
  project's branches.
. Click the run icon
  image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline-12-run-icon.png[alt="Run icon",width=3%]
  of the `production` branch of your Pipeline project, then quickly click the
  *OPEN* link that appears briefly at the lower-right to see Jenkins building
  the `production` branch with the amended `Jenkinsfile`. If you weren't able to
  click the **OPEN** link, click the _top_ row on the Blue Ocean *Activity* page
  to access this feature.
. Within a few minutes and when the build pauses, ensure you are viewing the
  *Deploy for production* stage (click it if necessary), then click the top
  green *Shell Script* step to expand its contents and scroll down until you see
  the `\http://localhost:5000` link.
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline-41-deploy-for-production-stage-opened.png[alt="Shell
Script step 'Deploy for production' stage opened",width=100%] +
. Click the `\http://localhost:5000` link to view your Node.js and React
  application in a new web browser tab. This will be running in production mode
  from a production build of your source code (generated using the `npm run
  build` command). Again, you should see a page/site with the title *Welcome to
  React* on it. However, this time, the application's contents are served by the
  link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve[npm `serve` module] and are also
  likely to continue running in the background in your browser.
. When you are finished viewing the page/site, click the *Proceed* button in
  Blue Ocean to complete the Pipeline's execution. +
  The Blue Ocean interface turns green if Jenkins built your Node.js and React
  application successfully from your `production` branch. Notice how the
  *Deploy for production* stage was executed but the *Deliver for development*
  stage was skipped.
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline-42-complete-pipeline-runs-successfully-on-production-branch.png[alt="Complete

. Click the *X* at the top-right to return to the *Activity* page of the Blue
  Ocean interface. +
  *Note:* Since your browser is likely to continue running the application's
  content served by the npm `serve` module, your browser will still show the
  content you viewed at `\http://localhost:5000` long after Jenkins has killed
  off the `serve` process. Read more about how to clear the application and its
  content from your browser <<clearing-the-app-from-your-browser,below>>.


=== Follow up (optional)

This section takes you through a simulated development workflow using
Jenkins, whereby changes made to your application (i.e. the `App.js` source
file) can be examined from the `development` branch before they are deployed to
production (from the `production` branch) via the `master` branch.

. Within your local repository's `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project`
  directory, run the command `git checkout development` to change to the
  `development` branch.
. Go back to your text editor/IDE and open the `App.js` file in the `src`
  directory of your local `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` Git
  repository.
. Copy and paste the following HTML syntax immediately under the `To get
  started...` line of your `App.js` file:
+
[source,html]
----
          <br/>
          This is a new line I added.
----
so that you end up with:
+
[source,javascript]
----
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <header className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <h1 className="App-title">Welcome to React</h1>
        </header>
        <p className="App-intro">
          To get started, edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
          <br/>
          This is a new line I added.
        </p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
----
. Save the edited `App.js` file and commit it to your local
  `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` Git repository. E.g. Within the
  `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` directory, run the commands: +
  `git stage .` +
  then +
  `git commit -m "Update 'App.js'"`
. Back in Blue Ocean, run your Pipeline on the `development` branch (as you did
  <<run-your-pipeline-on-the-development-branch,above>>) and check the results
  through `\http://localhost:3000` to see your new line added.
. Assuming you're happy with the change, then within your local repository's
  `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` directory, run the following set of
  commands to pull your change into the `production` branch (via the `master`
  branch):
* `git checkout master` +
  and
* `git pull . development` +
  then
* `git checkout production` +
  and
* `git pull . master` +
. Back in Blue Ocean, run your Pipeline on the `production` branch this time (as
  you did <<run-your-pipeline-on-the-production-branch,above>>) and check the
  results through `\http://localhost:5000` to see your new line added. +
  *Notes:*
* Since your browser is likely to cache the contents of the npm `serve` module,
  you may need to refresh your browser page to see your change.
* In a real software development environment with small to large teams of
  people, pulling changes between branches is more likely to be conducted using
  pull requests on a cloud- or web-hosted Git service (such as GitHub or
  BitBucket).


=== Clearing the app from your browser

Your browser is likely to continue running your application's content served by
the link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve[npm `serve` module], which means
that your browser will still show the content you viewed at
`\http://localhost:5000` long after Jenkins has killed off the `serve` process.
To clear the application and its content from your browser:


==== On Chrome

. Enter the following into your browser's URL field: +
  `chrome://serviceworker-internals/`
. Locate the "ServiceWorker" entry for `\http://localhost:5000`
. Click its *Unregister* button.


==== On Firefox

. Enter the following into your browser's URL field: +
  `about:serviceworkers`
. Locate the "Registered Service Worker" entry for `\http://localhost:5000`
. Click its *Unregister* button.


=== Wrapping up

Well done! You've just used Jenkins to build a multibranch Pipeline project
with selectively run stages!

This tutorial demonstrated the power of using a single `Jenkinsfile` across
multiple branches of your repository to orchestrate different build and delivery
outcomes in Jenkins.

Because Jenkins is extremely extensible, it can be modified and configured to
handle practically any aspect of build orchestration and automation.

To learn more about what Jenkins can do, check out:

* The link:/doc/tutorials[Tutorials overview] page for other introductory
  tutorials.
* The link:/doc/book[User Handbook] for more detailed information about using
  Jenkins, such as link:/doc/book/pipeline[Pipelines] (in particular
  link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax[Pipeline syntax]) and the
  link:/doc/book/blueocean[Blue Ocean] interface.
