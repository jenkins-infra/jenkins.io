This tutorial shows you how to use Jenkins to orchestrate building and testing
a simple https://nodejs.org/en/[Node.js] and https://reactjs.org/[React]
application with the https://www.npmjs.com/[Node Package Manager (npm)], _as
well as_ deliver different outcomes for development and production purposes.

Before starting this tutorial, it is recommended that you run through at least
one of the initial set of link:../#introductory-tutorials[Introductory
tutorials] from the link:..[Tutorials overview] page first to familiarize
yourself with CI/CD concepts (relevant to a technology stack you're most
familiar with), how these concepts are implemented in Jenkins and the
fundamentals of Jenkins Pipelines.

In this tutorial, you'll use the same application that the
link:../build-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm[Build a Node.js and React app
with npm] tutorial is based on. Therefore, you'll be building and testing the
same application but this time, its delivery will be different depending on the
Git branch that Jenkins builds from. That is, the branch being built determines
which delivery stage of your Pipeline is executed.

*Duration:* This tutorial takes 30-50 minutes to complete (assuming you've
already met the <<prerequisites,Prerequisites>> below).
The exact duration will depend on the speed of your machine and whether you've already installed `docker` and `docker compose`.

You can stop this tutorial at any point in time and continue from where you left
off.

[[fork-sample-repository]]
[[fork-and-clone-the-sample-repository-on-github]]
=== Fork and clone the sample repository

Obtain the simple "link:https://github.com/jenkins-docs/building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project.git[Welcome to React]" Node.js and React application from GitHub,
by forking the sample repository of the application's source code into your own
GitHub account and then cloning this fork locally.

. Ensure you are signed in to your GitHub account. If you don't yet have a
GitHub account, sign up for a free one on the link:https://github.com/[GitHub
  website].
. Fork the
link:https://github.com/jenkins-docs/building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project[`building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project`]
on GitHub into your local GitHub account. If you need help with this process,
refer to the link:https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/[Fork A Repo]
documentation on the GitHub website for more information.
. Clone your forked `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` repository (on
GitHub) locally to your machine. To begin this process, do either of the
following (where `<your-username>` is the name of your user account on your
operating system):
** If you have the GitHub Desktop app installed on your machine:
.. In GitHub, click the green *Clone or download* button on your forked
repository, then *Open in Desktop*.
.. In GitHub Desktop, before clicking *Clone* on the *Clone a Repository* dialog
box, ensure *Local Path* for:
*** macOS is `/Users/<your-username>/Documents/GitHub/building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project`
*** Linux is `/home/<your-username>/GitHub/building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project`
*** Windows is `C:\Users\<your-username>\Documents\GitHub\building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project`
** Otherwise:
.. Open up a terminal/command line prompt and `cd` to the appropriate directory
on:
*** macOS - `/Users/<your-username>/Documents/GitHub/`
*** Linux - `/home/<your-username>/GitHub/`
*** Windows - `C:\Users\<your-username>\Documents\GitHub\` (although use a Git
bash command line window as opposed to the usual Microsoft command prompt)
.. Run the following command to continue/complete cloning your forked repo: +
`git clone \https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-ACCOUNT-NAME/building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` +
where `YOUR-GITHUB-ACCOUNT-NAME` is the name of your GitHub account.

=== Create development and production branches in your repository

Before creating your Pipeline project in Jenkins, create "development" and
"production" branches of your locally cloned Git repository. You'll be creating
a single Jenkinsfile (initially in the `master` branch, which you'll pull into
the other branches) whose stages will be selectively executed based on the
branch that Jenkins is building from.

Within the `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` directory (i.e. your local clone of the sample repository):

. Run the following command to create the `development` branch (from the contents of the `master` branch):
+
[source,bash]
----
git checkout development
----
. Push the `development` branch and set it to track the remote branch:
+
[source,bash]
----
git push -u origin development
----
. Run the following command to create the `production` branch (from the contents of the `master` branch):
+
[source,bash]
----
git checkout production
----
. Push the `production` branch and set it to track the remote branch:
+
[source,bash]
----
git push -u origin production
----
. Get back to the `master` branch:
+
[source,bash]
----
git checkout master
----
. Check that these branches now exist by running the command `git branch`, which should give you:
+
[source,bash]
----
  development
* master
  production
----

=== Start your Jenkins instance

1. Obtain the latest Jenkins instance, customized for this tutorial, by cloning the link:https://github.com/jenkins-docs/quickstart-tutorials.git[quickstart-tutorials repository].
2. After cloning, navigate to the `quickstart-tutorials` directory, and execute the command
+
----
docker compose --profile multi up -d
----
to run the example.
3. Once the containers are running successfully (you can verify this with `docker compose ps`), the controller can be accessed at http://localhost:8080.

If you are unable to install `docker compose` on your machine for any reason, you can still run the example in the cloud for free thanks to link:https://www.gitpod.io/[GitPod]. GitPod link:https://www.gitpod.io/pricing[is free] for 50 hours per month.
You need to link it to your GitHub account so you can run the example in the cloud.
Click on link:https://gitpod.io/?autostart=true#https://github.com/jenkins-docs/quickstart-tutorials[that link] to open a new browser tab with a GitPod workspace where you'll be able to start the Jenkins instance, and run the rest of the tutorial.

Now, log in using the `admin` username and `admin` password.


=== Create your Multibranch Pipeline project

. Go back to Jenkins and ensure you are logged in link:http://localhost:8080/[http://localhost:8080/] and have clicked *New Item* on the left.
. In the *Enter an item name* box, type `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project`, select *Multibranch Pipeline* and click *OK*.
+
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline/create-a-multibranch-pipeline.png[alt="Create a multibranch pipeline",width=100%]
. In the *Display Name* field, type `Building a Multibranch Pipeline Project`.
. In the *Branch Sources* section, click *Add source* and select *GitHub*.
. In the *GitHub* section, there is a field labeled *Repository HTTPS URL*. Enter `https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-ACCOUNT-NAME/building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project.git`, and click *Validate*.
+
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline/credentials-ok.png[alt="Credentials ok",width=100%]
. You can now click on *Save* to save your new Pipeline project. +
. Jenkins will now scan your remote repository for branches and create a Pipeline for each branch that contains a `Jenkinsfile`.
+
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline/found-all-branches.png[alt="Found all branches",width=100%]
. Jenkins has found your three branches, and no pull requests for the time being. +
. You can now scroll up and click on *Building a Multibranch Pipeline Project* to access the main page of your new Multibranch Pipeline project.
+
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline/multibranch-pipeline-main-page.png[alt="Multibranch pipeline main page",width=100%]
. Jenkins found a `Jenkinsfile` in each branch, and it has already built each branch.

[NOTE]
====
The Pipeline stub consists of the basic requirements for a valid Pipeline - i.e.
an link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax#agent[`agent`] and a
link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax#stages[`stages`] section, as well as a
link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax#stage[`stage`] directive.

The reason why the `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` repository includes a `Jenkinsfile` Pipeline stub is that its presence in a branch makes Jenkins detect that there's something to build (i.e. the `Jenkinsfile`) immediately after creating the Multibranch Pipeline project, which in turn makes these branches accessible through the Jenkins interface.

If you created a Pipeline project, but created more branches later on, either:

* Use the *Scan Repository Now* feature in the Multibranch Pipeline project or
* Implement webhooks into your Git repository.
====


=== Create your initial Pipeline as a Jenkinsfile with build and test stages

You're now ready to create the Pipeline that will automate building your Node.js and React application in Jenkins.
Your Pipeline will be created as a `Jenkinsfile`, which will be committed to the `master` branch of your forked and locally cloned Git repository (`building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project`).

First, create an initial Pipeline to build your simple Node.js and React application.
Also add a "Build" stage to the Pipeline to begin orchestrating this whole process and a "Test" stage to check that the application renders satisfactorily.

. Using your favorite text editor or IDE, open the existing `Jenkinsfile` at the root of your local `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` Git repository and _clear_ its contents. +
*Note:* Be sure you are performing this step on the `master` branch of your
repository.
. Copy the following Declarative Pipeline code and paste it into your empty
`Jenkinsfile`:
+
[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
    agent any
    environment {
        CI = 'true'
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm install'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh './jenkins/scripts/test.sh'
            }
        }
    }
}
----
+
*Note:* For an explanation of the other components of this `Jenkinsfile`, refer to the annotations of the Declarative Pipeline in the link:../build-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm/#create-your-initial-pipeline-as-a-jenkinsfile[``Create your initial Pipeline...''] and link:../build-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm/#add-a-test-stage-to-your-pipeline[``Add a test stage...''] sections of the link:../build-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm/[Build a Node.js and React app with npm] tutorial.
. Save your edited `Jenkinsfile` and commit it to your local `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` Git repository.
E.g. Within the `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` directory, run the commands: +
`git add Jenkinsfile` +
then +
`git commit -m "Add initial Jenkinsfile with 'Test' stage"` +
and finally +
`git push` to push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub, so it can be picked up by Jenkins.
. Go back to Jenkins again, log in again if necessary, click on the *Building a Multibranch Pipeline Project* link if it is visible, or on *Dashboard* and then on the *Building a Multibranch Pipeline Project* link.
. You should see the list of branches detected on the previous steps. Look at the row containing `master`. There is a green triangle on the right side of this row (the run icon). image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline/run-icon.png[alt="Run icon",width=3%]
Click on it.
+
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline/schedule-a-build-for-master.png[alt="Schedule a build for master",width=100%]
. Click on `master` to see a new Pipeline being built. +
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline/master-build-after-first-modification.png[alt="Master build after first modification",width=100%]
. Click on `#2` or on the latest build number to see the details of the build. +
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline/2nd-build-details.png[alt="2nd build details",width=100%]
. Click on *Pipeline Overview* on the left to see the stages of the Pipeline. +
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline/build-2-pipeline-overview.png[alt="Pipeline overview",width=100%]
. Click on *Test* and then on the green part to see the details of the test stage. +
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline/test-stage-details.png[alt="Test stage details",width=100%]

=== Add deliver and deploy stages to your Pipeline

Next, add "`Deliver for development`" and "`Deploy for production`" stages to your
Pipeline, which Jenkins will selectively execute based on the branch that Jenkins is building from.

This takes the "Pipeline-as-Code" concept to a new level, in which a single `Jenkinsfile` describes your project's entire build, test, delivery and deployment processes in Jenkins for each branch of your repository.
Read more about Pipeline and what a Jenkinsfile is in the link:/doc/book/pipeline[Pipeline] and link:/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile[Using a Jenkinsfile] sections of the User Handbook.

. Go back to your text editor/IDE and ensure your `Jenkinsfile` is open.
. Copy and paste the following Declarative Pipeline syntax immediately under the
`Test` stage of your `Jenkinsfile`:
+
[source,groovy]
----
        stage('Deliver for development') {
            when {
                branch 'development'
            }
            steps {
                sh './jenkins/scripts/deliver-for-development.sh'
                input message: 'Finished using the web site? (Click "Proceed" to continue)'
                sh './jenkins/scripts/kill.sh'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy for production') {
            when {
                branch 'production'
            }
            steps {
                sh './jenkins/scripts/deploy-for-production.sh'
                input message: 'Finished using the web site? (Click "Proceed" to continue)'
                sh './jenkins/scripts/kill.sh'
            }
        }
----
so that you end up with:
+
[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
    agent any
    environment {
        CI = 'true'
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm install'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh './jenkins/scripts/test.sh'
            }
        }
        stage('Deliver for development') {
            when {
                branch 'development' // <1>
            }
            steps {
                sh './jenkins/scripts/deliver-for-development.sh'
                input message: 'Finished using the web site? (Click "Proceed" to continue)'
                sh './jenkins/scripts/kill.sh'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy for production') {
            when {
                branch 'production'  // <1>
            }
            steps {
                sh './jenkins/scripts/deploy-for-production.sh'
                input message: 'Finished using the web site? (Click "Proceed" to continue)'
                sh './jenkins/scripts/kill.sh'
            }
        }
    }
}
----
<1> These link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax#when[`when`] directives (along with their `branch` conditions) determine whether or not the
link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax#stage[`stages`] (containing these `when` directives) should be executed.
If a `branch` condition's value (i.e. pattern) matches the name of the branch that Jenkins is running the build from, then the
`stage` that contains this `when` and `branch` construct will be executed.
+
*Notes:*
* For an explanation of the `input message` steps, refer to annotation *4* of the Declarative Pipeline at the link:../build-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm/#add-a-final-deliver-stage-to-your-pipeline[``Add a final deliver stage...'' section of the Build a Node.js and React app] tutorial.
* For an explanation of the `deliver-for-development.sh`, `deploy-for-production.sh` and `kill.sh` script steps, refer to the contents
of these files located in the `jenkins/scripts` directory from the root of the `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` repository.
. Save your edited `Jenkinsfile` and commit it to your local `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` Git repository.
E.g. Within the `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` directory, run the commands: +
`git add .` +
then +
`git commit -m "Add 'Deliver...' and 'Deploy...' stages"` +
and finally +
`git push` to push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub, so it can be picked up by Jenkins.
. Go back to Jenkins again, log in again if necessary and go to the Dashboard.
. Click *Building a Multibranch Pipeline Project* to access the main page of your Multibranch Pipeline project.
. Click the run icon image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline/run-icon.png[alt="Run icon",width=3%] of the `master` branch of your Pipeline project.
. Click on *master* to see a new Pipeline being built.
. Click on `#3` or on the latest build number to see the details of the build.
. Click on *Pipeline Overview* on the left to see the stages of the Pipeline. +
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline/build-3-pipeline-overview.png[alt="Complete Pipeline runs successfully on the 'master' branch",width=100%]
. Notice how Jenkins skips the last two stages you added, since the branch you are running the build from (`master`) does not meet the `when` directives' `branch` conditions in these stages.

=== Pull your updated Jenkinsfile into the other repository branches

Now that you have a completed `Jenkinsfile` to build your application in
Jenkins, you can pull this file from the `master` branch of your local
repository into its `development` and `production` branches.

Within your local repository's `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project`
directory:

. Run the following commands to pull changes from `master` to
`development`:
* `git checkout development` +
and
* `git pull . master`
and then
* `git push` to push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub, so it can be picked up by Jenkins.
. Also run the following commands to pull changes from `master` to `production`:
* `git checkout production` +
and
* `git pull . master`
and then
* `git push` to push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub, so it can be picked up by Jenkins.

+
Your `development` and `production` branches should now have all your
`Jenkinsfile` updates you made on the `master` branch.


=== Run your Pipeline on the development branch

. Go back to Jenkins again, log in again if necessary, navigate to the dashboard, and select *Building a Multibranch Pipeline Project*.
. Click the Run icon image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline/run-icon.png[alt="Run icon",width=3%] of the `development` branch of your Pipeline project on the far right to see Jenkins building the `development` branch with the amended `Jenkinsfile`. +
. Select *development* to see a new Pipeline being built. +
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline/build-development-branch.png[alt="Build development branch",width=100%] +
. Select *#2* (or the latest build number) on the left, and then *Pipeline Overview* on the left. +
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline/deliver-for-development.png[alt="Deliver for development",width=100%] +
. Select the *Deliver for development* stage and then the top green *Shell Script* step to expand its contents and scroll down until you see the `\http://localhost:3000` link. +
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline/deliver-for-development-shell-script.png[alt="Shell Script step 'Deliver for development' stage opened",width=100%] +
*Note:* Since you are building the application on a different branch, the `npm install` step might require a few minutes for `npm` to download the many dependencies required to run your Node.js and React application (stored in a local `node_modules` directory within the Jenkins home directory).
These dependencies are downloaded again because this Jenkins build would be the first time you are running your Pipeline project on the `development` branch and each branch has its own workspace directory (containing its own `node_modules` directory) within the Jenkins home directory.
. +++<kbd>+++Ctrl+++</kbd>+++-Click or +++<kbd>+++Cmd+++</kbd>+++-Click the `\http://localhost:3000` link to view your Node.js and React application running in development mode (with the `npm start` command) in a new web browser tab.
You should see a page/site with the title *Welcome to React* on it.
. When you are finished viewing the page/site, go back to the Jenkins tab and select *#2* (or the last number of your build), and then *Paused for Input* on the left hand side. +
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline/proceed.png[alt="Paused for input. Proceed",width=100%] +
. Select the *Proceed* button to complete the Pipeline's execution.
. Once more, select the *#2* on top of the screen (or the last number of your build) and then *Pipeline Overview* on the left hand side to see the stages of the Pipeline. +
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline/complete-pipeline-runs-successfully-on-development-branch.png[alt="Complete Pipeline runs successfully on the 'development' branch",width=100%] +
. Notice how the *Deliver for development* stage was executed but the *Deploy for production* stage was not.

=== Run your Pipeline on the production branch

. Go back to Jenkins again, log in again if necessary, navigate to the dashboard, and select *Building a Multibranch Pipeline Project*.
. Click the Run icon image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline/run-icon.png[alt="Run icon",width=3%] of the `production` branch of your Pipeline project on the far right to see Jenkins building the `production` branch with the amended `Jenkinsfile`. +
. Select *production* to see a new Pipeline being built. +
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline/build-production-branch.png[alt="Build production branch",width=100%] +
. Select *#2* (or the latest build number) on the left, and then *Pipeline Overview* on the left. +
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline/deploy-for-production.png[alt="Deploy for production",width=100%] +
. Select the *Deploy for production* stage and then the top green *Shell Script* step to expand its contents and scroll down until you see the `\http://localhost:5000` link. +
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline/deploy-for-production-shell-script.png[alt="Shell Script step 'Deploy for production' stage opened",width=100%] +
. +++<kbd>+++Ctrl+++</kbd>+++-Click or +++<kbd>+++Cmd+++</kbd>+++-Click the `\http://localhost:5000` link to view your Node.js and React application in a new web browser tab.
This will be running in production mode from a production build of your source code (generated using the `npm run build` command).
Once again, you should see a page/site with the title *Welcome to React* on it.
However, this time, the application's contents are served by the link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve[npm `serve` module] and are also
likely to continue running in the background in your browser.
. When you are finished viewing the page/site, go back to the Jenkins tab and select *#2* (or the last number of your build), and then *Paused for Input* on the left hand side. +
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline/proceed-for-production.png[alt="Paused for input. Proceed",width=100%] +
. Select the *Proceed* button to complete the Pipeline's execution.
. Once more, select the *#2* on top of the screen (or the last number of your build) and then *Pipeline Overview* on the left hand side to see the stages of the Pipeline. +
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/multibranch-pipeline/complete-pipeline-runs-successfully-on-production-branch.png[alt="Complete Pipeline runs successfully on the 'production' branch",width=100%] +
. The *Deploy for production* stage turns green if Jenkins built your Node.js and React application successfully from your production branch.
Notice how the *Deploy for production* stage was executed but the *Deliver for development* stage was skipped.
*Note:* Since your browser is likely to continue running the application's
content served by the npm `serve` module, your browser will still show the
content you viewed at `\http://localhost:5000` long after Jenkins has killed
off the `serve` process. Read more about how to clear the application and its
content from your browser <<clearing-the-app-from-your-browser,below>>.


=== Follow up (optional)

This section takes you through a simulated development workflow using
Jenkins, whereby changes made to your application (i.e. the `App.js` source
file) can be examined from the `development` branch before they are deployed to
production (from the `production` branch) via the `master` branch.

. Within your local repository's `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project`
directory, run the command `git checkout development` to change to the
`development` branch.
. Go back to your text editor/IDE and open the `App.js` file in the `src`
directory of your local `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` Git
repository.
. Copy and paste the following HTML syntax immediately under the `To get
started...` line of your `App.js` file:
+
[source,html]
----
          <br/>
          This is a new line I added.
----
so that you end up with:
+
[source,javascript]
----
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <p>
          Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
        <a
          className="App-link"
          href="https://reactjs.org"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          Learn React<br/>
          This is a new line I added.
        </a>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
----
. Save the edited `App.js` file and commit it to your local
`building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` Git repository. E.g. Within the
`building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` directory, run the commands: +
`git add src/App.js` +
then +
`git commit -m "Update 'App.js'"`
and finally +
`git push` to push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub, so it can be picked up by Jenkins.

. Back in Jenkins, run your Pipeline on the `development` branch (as you did <<run-your-pipeline-on-the-development-branch,above>>) and check the results through `\http://localhost:3000` to see your new line added.
. Assuming you're happy with the change, then within your local repository's `building-a-multibranch-pipeline-project` directory, run the following set of commands to merge your change into the `production` branch (via the `master` branch):
* `git checkout master` +
and
* `git pull . development` +
and then
* `git push` +
Once done with master, let's move to production:
* `git checkout production` +
and
* `git pull . master` +
and then
* `git push` +
. Back in Jenkins, run your Pipeline on the `production` branch this time (as you did <<run-your-pipeline-on-the-production-branch,above>>) and check the results through `\http://localhost:5000` to see your new line added. +
*Notes:*
* Since your browser is likely to cache the contents of the npm `serve` module, you may need to refresh your browser page to see your change.
* In a real software development environment with small to large teams of people, pulling changes between branches is more likely to be conducted using pull requests on a cloud- or web-hosted Git service (such as GitHub or BitBucket).


=== Clearing the app from your browser

Your browser is likely to continue running your application's content served by the link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve[npm `serve` module], which means that your browser will still show the content you viewed at `\http://localhost:5000` long after Jenkins has killed off the `serve` process.
To clear the application and its content from your browser:

==== On Chrome

. Enter the following into your browser's URL field: +
`chrome://serviceworker-internals/`
. Locate the "ServiceWorker" entry for `\http://localhost:5000`
. Click its *Unregister* button.

==== On Firefox

. Enter the following into your browser's URL field: +
`about:serviceworkers`
. Locate the "Registered Service Worker" entry for `\http://localhost:5000`
. Click its *Unregister* button.


=== Wrapping up

Well done! You've just used Jenkins to build a multibranch Pipeline project with selectively run stages!

This tutorial demonstrated the power of using a single `Jenkinsfile` across multiple branches of your repository to orchestrate different build and delivery outcomes in Jenkins.

Because Jenkins is extremely extensible, it can be modified and configured to handle practically any aspect of build orchestration and automation.

To learn more about what Jenkins can do, check out:

* The link:/doc/tutorials[Tutorials overview] page for other introductory tutorials.
* The link:/doc/book[User Handbook] for more detailed information about using Jenkins, such as link:/doc/book/pipeline[Pipelines] (in particular link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax[Pipeline syntax]) and the link:/doc/book/blueocean[Blue Ocean] interface.
* The link:/node[Jenkins blog] for the latest events, other tutorials and updates.

=== Cleaning Up Your Environment

After completing the tutorial, it's important to clean up your environment to prevent interference with other tutorials you might try later.

To stop the containers and remove associated volumes:

[source,bash]
----
docker compose --profile multi down -v --remove-orphans
----

This command ensures a clean slate for your next project.

[NOTE]
====
The `--remove-orphans` option instructs Docker Compose to remove any containers that are not defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file but are labeled as belonging to the project.
This helps in cleaning up any services that might have been started independently but are considered part of the project.
