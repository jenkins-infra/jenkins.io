This tutorial shows you how to use Jenkins to build a simple Java application with https://maven.apache.org/[Maven].

If you are a Java developer using Maven, but new to CI/CD concepts, or if you are familiar with these concepts, but don't know how to implement building your application using Jenkins, then this tutorial is for you.

This example Java application from a GitHub repository outputs the string "Hello world!", and is accompanied by some unit tests, to check that the main application works as expected.
The test results are saved to a JUnit XML report.

*Duration:* This tutorial takes 20-40 minutes to complete, assuming you meet the below <<prerequisites,prerequisites>>.
The exact duration will depend on the speed of your machine and whether or not you've already <<run-jenkins-in-docker,run Jenkins in Docker>> from link:..[another tutorial].

You can stop this tutorial at any time and continue from where you left off.

If you've already run through link:..[another tutorial], you can skip the <<prerequisites,Prerequisites>> and <<run-jenkins-in-docker,Run Jenkins in Docker>> sections below and proceed to <<fork-sample-repository,forking the sample repository>>.
Make sure you have link:https://git-scm.com/downloads[Git] installed locally.
If you need to restart Jenkins, simply follow the restart instructions in <<stopping-and-restarting-jenkins,Stopping and restarting Jenkins>>, and then proceed.

[[fork-and-clone-the-sample-repository-on-github]]
=== Fork and clone the sample repository

Get the "Hello world!" Java application from GitHub, by forking the sample repository of the application's source code into your own GitHub account, and then cloning this fork locally.

. Make sure you are signed in to your GitHub account.
If you don't yet have a GitHub account, sign up for free at link:https://github.com/[GitHub].
. Fork the link:https://github.com/jenkins-docs/simple-java-maven-app[`simple-java-maven-app`] on GitHub into your local GitHub account.
If you need help, refer to the link:https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/[GitHub documentation on forking a repo] for more information.
. Clone the forked `simple-java-maven-app` repository from GitHub to your machine.
To begin this process, do either of the following, where `<your-username>` is the name of your user account on your operating system:
** If you have the link:https://desktop.github.com/[GitHub Desktop] app installed on your machine:
.. In GitHub, select *Code* in your forked repository, then select *Open with GitHub Desktop*.
.. In GitHub Desktop, before selecting *Clone* in *Clone a Repository*, ensure *Local Path* for your operating system, as follows:
*** macOS is `/Users/<your-username>/Documents/GitHub/simple-java-maven-app`
*** Linux is `/home/<your-username>/GitHub/simple-java-maven-app`
*** Windows is `C:\Users\<your-username>\Documents\GitHub\simple-java-maven-app`
** Alternatively:
.. Open a terminal/command line prompt and `cd` to the appropriate directory, according to your operating system:
*** macOS - `/Users/<your-username>/Documents/GitHub/`
*** Linux - `/home/<your-username>/GitHub/`
*** Windows - `C:\Users\<your-username>\Documents\GitHub\` (Use a Git bash command line window, not the usual Microsoft command prompt)
.. Run the following command to clone your forked repo, replacing `YOUR-GITHUB-ACCOUNT-NAME` with the name of your GitHub account:
+
----
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-ACCOUNT-NAME/simple-java-maven-app
----

=== Create your Pipeline project in Jenkins

. In Jenkins, sign in again if necessary, and select *create new jobs* under *Welcome to Jenkins!*.
If your display is different, select *New Item* at the top left.
. Enter your new Pipeline project name in *Enter an item name*.
. Scroll down and select *Pipeline*, then select *OK* at the end of the page.
. (Optional) Enter a Pipeline *Description*.
. Select *Pipeline* on the left pane.
. Select *Definition*, and then select the *Pipeline script from SCM* option.
This option instructs Jenkins to obtain your Pipeline from source control management (SCM), which is your locally cloned Git repository.
. Select *Git* from the options in *SCM*.
. Enter the directory path of your locally cloned repository <<fork-sample-repository,above>> in *Script Path*.
This directory path from your user account/home directory on your host machine is mapped to the `/home` directory of the Jenkins container, according to your operating system, below:
* For macOS - `/home/Documents/GitHub/simple-java-maven-app`
* For Linux - `/home/GitHub/simple-java-maven-app`
* For Windows - `/home/Documents/GitHub/simple-java-maven-app`
. Select *Save* to save your new Pipeline project.
You're now ready create a `Jenkinsfile` to check into your locally cloned Git repository.

=== Create your initial Pipeline as a Jenkinsfile

You can now create a Pipeline that automates building your Java application with Maven in Jenkins.

Your Pipeline is created as a `Jenkinsfile`, which is committed to your locally cloned Git repository (`simple-java-maven-app`).

This is the foundation of "Pipeline-as-Code", which treats the continuous delivery pipeline as a part of the application, to be versioned and reviewed like any other code.
Read more about Pipeline and what a Jenkinsfile is in the link:/doc/book/pipeline[Pipeline] and link:/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile[Using a Jenkinsfile] sections of the User Handbook.

First, create an initial Pipeline to download a Maven Docker image and run it as a Docker container, which builds your Java application.
Be sure to add a "Build" stage to the Pipeline that begins orchestrating this whole process.

. Using your favorite text editor or IDE, create and save a new text file with the name `Jenkinsfile` at the root of your local `simple-java-maven-app` Git repository.
. Copy the following Declarative Pipeline code and paste it into your empty `Jenkinsfile`:
+
[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker {
            image 'maven:3.9.5-eclipse-temurin-17-alpine' // <1>
            args '-v /root/.m2:/root/.m2' // <2>
        }
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') { // <3>
            steps {
                sh 'mvn -B -DskipTests clean package' // <4>
            }
        }
    }
}
----
<1> This `image` parameter of the link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax#agent[`agent`] section's `docker` parameter downloads the link:https://hub.docker.com/_/maven/[`maven:3.9.5-eclipse-temurin-17-alpine` Docker image], if not already available on your machine, and runs this image as a separate container.
This means that:
* You'll have separate Jenkins and Maven containers running locally in Docker.
* The Maven container becomes the link:/doc/book/glossary/#agent[agent] that Jenkins uses to run your Pipeline project.
However, this container is short-lived: for the duration of your Pipeline's execution.
<2> This `args` parameter creates a reciprocal mapping between the `/root/.m2` directories in the short-lived Maven Docker container and that of your Docker host's filesystem.
A fuller explanation is beyond the scope of this tutorial.
You do this mainly to ensure that the artifacts for building your Java application, which Maven downloads while your Pipeline is being executed, are retained in the Maven repository after the Maven container is gone.
This prevents Maven from downloading the same artifacts during successive Pipeline runs.
NOTE: Unlike the Docker data volume created for `jenkins-data` <<download-and-run-jenkins-in-docker,above>>, the Docker host's filesystem is effectively cleared out each time Docker is restarted, so you lose the downloaded Maven repository artifacts each time Docker restarts.
<3> Defines a link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#stage[`stage`] (directive) called `Build` that appears on the Jenkins UI.
<4> This link:/doc/pipeline/steps/workflow-durable-task-step/#code-sh-code-shell-script[`sh`] step runs the Maven command to cleanly build your Java application without running any tests.
. Save your edited `Jenkinsfile` and commit it to your local `simple-java-maven-app` Git repository.
Within the `simple-java-maven-app` directory, run the commands:
+
.. `git add .`
.. `git commit -m "Add initial Jenkinsfile"`

. In Jenkins, sign in if necessary, and select *Open Blue Ocean* on the left pane.
. Select *Run* from the *This job has not been run* options, then quickly select *OPEN* on the lower-right.
If you cannot select *OPEN* in time, you can alternatively select the top row on the main Blue Ocean interface to display Jenkins running your project.
You may need to wait several minutes for this first run to complete.
After making a clone of your local `simple-java-maven-app` Git repository itself, Jenkins:
.. Initially queues the project to be run on the agent.
.. Downloads the Maven Docker image and runs it in a container on Docker.
+
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/java-maven-01-downloading-maven-docker-image.png[alt="Downloading
Maven Docker image",width=100%]
.. Runs the `Build` stage defined in the `Jenkinsfile` on the Maven container.
During this time, Maven downloads many artifacts necessary to build your Java application, which are ultimately stored in Jenkins' local Maven repository in the Docker host's filesystem.

=== Add a test stage to your Pipeline

. Go back to your text editor/IDE and ensure your `Jenkinsfile` is open.
. Copy and paste the following Declarative Pipeline syntax immediately under the `Build` stage of your `Jenkinsfile`:
+
[source,groovy]
----
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
            post {
                always {
                    junit 'target/surefire-reports/*.xml'
                }
            }
        }
----
so that you end up with:
+
[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker {
            image 'maven:3.9.5-eclipse-temurin-17-alpine'
            args '-v /root/.m2:/root/.m2'
        }
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn -B -DskipTests clean package'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') { // <1>
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test' // <2>
            }
            post {
                always {
                    junit 'target/surefire-reports/*.xml' // <3>
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
----
<1> Defines a link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#stage[`stage`] (directive) called `Test` that appears on the Jenkins UI.
<2> This link:/doc/pipeline/steps/workflow-durable-task-step/#code-sh-code-shell-script[`sh`] step executes the Maven command to run the unit test on your Java application.
This command also generates a JUnit XML report, which is saved to the `target/surefire-reports` directory within the `/var/jenkins_home/workspace/simple-java-maven-app` directory in the Jenkins container.
<3> This link:/doc/pipeline/steps/junit/#code-junit-code-archive-junit-formatted-test-results[`junit`] step (provided by the link:/doc/pipeline/steps/junit[JUnit Plugin]), archives the JUnit XML report generated by the `mvn test` command above, and displays the results through the Jenkins interface.
In Blue Ocean, select *Tests* to access the Pipeline run test results.
The link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#post[`post`] section's `always` condition that contains this `junit` step ensures that the step is _always_ executed _at the completion_ of the `Test` stage, regardless of the stage's outcome.
. Save your edited `Jenkinsfile` and commit it to your local `simple-java-maven-app` Git repository.
Within the `simple-java-maven-app` directory, run the commands:
+
.. `git stage .`
.. `git commit -m "Add 'Test' stage"`

. In Jenkins, sign in if necessary, and access the Blue Ocean interface.
. Select *Run* at the top left, then quickly select *OPEN*, which appears briefly at the lower-right, to display Jenkins running your updated Pipeline project.
Alternatively, you can select the _top_ row on the Blue Ocean interface to display Jenkins running your updated Pipeline project.
+
Note that Jenkins no longer needs to download the Maven Docker image.
Instead, Jenkins runs a new container from the Maven image downloaded previously.
If Docker has not restarted since you last ran the Pipeline <<create-your-initial-pipeline-as-a-jenkinsfile,above>>, then no Maven artifacts are downloaded during the "Build" stage.
Therefore, running your Pipeline this subsequent time should be much faster.

The Blue Ocean interface displays as below if a Pipeline runs successfully.
Notice the additional "Test" stage.
You can select the previous "Build" stage circle to access the output from that stage.

. Select the *X* at the top-right to return to the main Blue Ocean interface.


=== Add a final deliver stage to your Pipeline

. Go back to your text editor/IDE and ensure your `Jenkinsfile` is open.
. Copy and paste the following Declarative Pipeline syntax immediately under the `Test` stage of your `Jenkinsfile`:
+
[source,groovy]
----
        stage('Deliver') {
            steps {
                sh './jenkins/scripts/deliver.sh'
            }
        }
----
Add a `skipStagesAfterUnstable` option, resulting in:
+
[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker {
            image 'maven:3.9.5-eclipse-temurin-17-alpine'
            args '-v /root/.m2:/root/.m2'
        }
    }
    options {
        skipStagesAfterUnstable()
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn -B -DskipTests clean package'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
            post {
                always {
                    junit 'target/surefire-reports/*.xml'
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Deliver') { // <1>
            steps {
                sh './jenkins/scripts/deliver.sh' // <2>
            }
        }
    }
}
----
<1> Defines a new stage called `Deliver` that appears on the Jenkins UI.
<2> This link:/doc/pipeline/steps/workflow-durable-task-step/#code-sh-code-shell-script[`sh`] step runs the shell script `deliver.sh` located in the `jenkins/scripts` directory from the root of the `simple-java-maven-app` repository.
Refer to the `deliver.sh` script file to learn more.
It is generally good practice to keep your Pipeline code, such as your `Jenkinsfile`, streamlined, and place more complex build steps, particularly stages consisting of 2 or more steps, into separate shell script files (like the `deliver.sh` file).
Maintaining your Pipeline code is easier this way.
. Save your updated `Jenkinsfile` and commit it to your local `simple-java-maven-app` Git repository.
+
.. `git stage .`
.. `git commit -m "Add 'Deliver' stage"`
. In Jenkins, sign in if necessary, and access Jenkins' Blue Ocean interface.
. Select *Run* at the top left, then quickly select *OPEN*, which appears briefly at the lower-right, to display Jenkins running your updated Pipeline project.
Alternatively, you can select the _top_ row on the Blue Ocean interface to display Jenkins running your updated Pipeline project.
The Blue Ocean interface displays as below if a Pipeline runs successfully.
Notice the additional "Deliver" stage.
Select the previous "Test" and "Build" stage circles to access the outputs from those stages.
+
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/java-maven-21-deliver-stage-runs-successfully.png[alt="Deliver

The "Deliver" stage output should be something like below, showing you the execution results of your Java application at the end.
[.boxshadow]

=== Wrapping up

Well done!
You've just used Jenkins to build a simple Java application with Maven!

The "Build", "Test" and "Deliver" stages you created above are the basis for building more complex Java applications with Maven in Jenkins, as well as Java and Maven applications that integrate with other technology stacks.

Because Jenkins is extremely extensible, it can be modified and configured to handle practically any aspect of build orchestration and automation.

To learn more about what Jenkins can do, check out:

* The link:/doc/tutorials[Tutorials overview] page for other introductory tutorials.
* The link:/doc/book[User Handbook] for more detailed information about using Jenkins, such as link:/doc/book/pipeline[Pipelines] (in particular link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax[Pipeline syntax]) and the link:/doc/book/blueocean[Blue Ocean] interface.
* The link:/node[Jenkins blog] for the latest events, other tutorials and updates.

Hide this warning due to temporary addition to 'mvn jar:jar install:install'
fix implemented.
*Warning:* It's possible that since Maven downloads artifacts during this final
`Deliver` stage, Maven will attempt to run some of the other commands further
down the `sh` step before the artifacts have finished downloading. This will
cause the build to fail. If you notice the build failing the first time, run
the Pipeline project again and it should succeed.
