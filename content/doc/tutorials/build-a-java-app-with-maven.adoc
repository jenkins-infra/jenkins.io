This tutorial shows you how to use Jenkins to orchestrate building a simple Java
application with https://maven.apache.org/[Maven].

If you are a Java developer who uses Maven and who is new to CI/CD concepts, or
you might be familiar with these concepts but don't know how to implement
building your application using Jenkins, then this tutorial is for you.

The simple Java application (which you'll obtain from a sample repository on
GitHub) outputs the string "Hello world!" and is accompanied by a couple of unit
tests to check that the main application works as expected. The results of these
tests are saved to a JUnit XML report.

*Duration:* This tutorial takes 20-40 minutes to complete (assuming you've
already met the <<prerequisites,prerequisites>> below). The exact duration will
depend on the speed of your machine and whether or not you've already
<<run-jenkins-in-docker,run Jenkins in Docker>> from link:..[another tutorial].

You can stop this tutorial at any point in time and continue from where you left
off.

If you've already run through link:..[another tutorial], you can skip the
<<prerequisites,Prerequisites>> and <<run-jenkins-in-docker,Run Jenkins in
Docker>> sections below and proceed on to <<fork-sample-repository,forking the
sample repository>>. (Just ensure you have
link:https://git-scm.com/downloads[Git] installed locally.) If you need to
restart Jenkins, simply follow the restart instructions in
<<stopping-and-restarting-jenkins,Stopping and restarting Jenkins>> and then
proceed on.

[[fork-and-clone-the-sample-repository-on-github]]
=== Fork and clone the sample repository

Obtain the simple "Hello world!" Java application from GitHub, by forking the
sample repository of the application's source code into your own GitHub account
and then cloning this fork locally.

. Ensure you are signed in to your GitHub account. If you don't yet have a
  GitHub account, sign up for a free one on the https://github.com/[GitHub
  website].
. Fork the
  https://github.com/jenkins-docs/simple-java-maven-app[`simple-java-maven-app`]
  on GitHub into your local GitHub account. If you need help with this process,
  refer to the https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/[Fork A Repo]
  documentation on the GitHub website for more information.
. Clone your forked `simple-java-maven-app` repository (on GitHub) locally to
  your machine. To begin this process, do either of the following (where
  `<your-username>` is the name of your user account on your operating system):
** If you have the GitHub Desktop app installed on your machine:
.. In GitHub, click the green *Clone or download* button on your forked
   repository, then *Open in Desktop*.
.. In GitHub Desktop, before clicking *Clone* on the *Clone a Repository* dialog
   box, ensure *Local Path* for:
*** macOS is `/Users/<your-username>/Documents/GitHub/simple-java-maven-app`
*** Linux is `/home/<your-username>/GitHub/simple-java-maven-app`
*** Windows is `C:\Users\<your-username>\Documents\GitHub\simple-java-maven-app`
** Otherwise:
.. Open up a terminal/command line prompt and `cd` to the appropriate directory
   on:
*** macOS - `/Users/<your-username>/Documents/GitHub/`
*** Linux - `/home/<your-username>/GitHub/`
*** Windows - `C:\Users\<your-username>\Documents\GitHub\` (although use a Git
    bash command line window as opposed to the usual Microsoft command prompt)
.. Run the following command to continue/complete cloning your forked repo: +
   `git clone \https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-ACCOUNT-NAME/simple-java-maven-app` +
   where `YOUR-GITHUB-ACCOUNT-NAME` is the name of your GitHub account.


=== Create your Pipeline project in Jenkins

. Go back to Jenkins, log in again if necessary and click *create new jobs*
  under *Welcome to Jenkins!* +
  *Note:* If you don't see this, click *New Item* at the top left.
. In the *Enter an item name* field, specify the name for your new Pipeline
  project (e.g. `simple-java-maven-app`).
. Scroll down and click *Pipeline*, then click *OK* at the end of the page.
. ( _Optional_ ) On the next page, specify a brief description for your Pipeline
  in the *Description* field (e.g. `An entry-level Pipeline demonstrating how to
  use Jenkins to build a simple Java application with Maven.`)
. Click the *Pipeline* tab at the top of the page to scroll down to the
  *Pipeline* section.
. From the *Definition* field, choose the *Pipeline script from SCM* option.
  This option instructs Jenkins to obtain your Pipeline from Source Control
  Management (SCM), which will be your locally cloned Git repository.
. From the *SCM* field, choose *Git*.
. In the *Repository URL* field, specify the directory path of your locally
  cloned repository <<fork-sample-repository,above>>,
  which is from your user account/home directory on your host machine, mapped to
  the `/home` directory of the Jenkins container - i.e.
* For macOS - `/home/Documents/GitHub/simple-java-maven-app`
* For Linux - `/home/GitHub/simple-java-maven-app`
* For Windows - `/home/Documents/GitHub/simple-java-maven-app`
. Click *Save* to save your new Pipeline project. You're now ready to begin
  creating your `Jenkinsfile`, which you'll be checking into your locally cloned
  Git repository.


=== Create your initial Pipeline as a Jenkinsfile

You're now ready to create your Pipeline that will automate building your Java
application with Maven in Jenkins. Your Pipeline will be created as a
`Jenkinsfile`, which will be committed to your locally cloned Git repository
(`simple-java-maven-app`).

This is the foundation of "Pipeline-as-Code", which treats the continuous
delivery pipeline as a part of the application to be versioned and reviewed like
any other code. Read more about Pipeline and what a Jenkinsfile is in the
link:/doc/book/pipeline[Pipeline] and link:/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile[Using
a Jenkinsfile] sections of the User Handbook.

First, create an initial Pipeline to download a Maven Docker image and run it as
a Docker container (which will build your simple Java application). Also add a
"Build" stage to the Pipeline that begins orchestrating this whole process.

. Using your favorite text editor or IDE, create and save new text file with the
  name `Jenkinsfile` at the root of your local `simple-java-maven-app` Git
  repository.
. Copy the following Declarative Pipeline code and paste it into your empty
  `Jenkinsfile`:
+
[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker {
            image 'maven:3.8.1-adoptopenjdk-11' // <1>
            args '-v /root/.m2:/root/.m2' // <2>
        }
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') { // <3>
            steps {
                sh 'mvn -B -DskipTests clean package' // <4>
            }
        }
    }
}
----
<1> This `image` parameter (of the link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax#agent[`agent`]
section's `docker` parameter) downloads the
https://hub.docker.com/_/maven/[`maven:3.8.1-adoptopenjdk-11` Docker image] (if it's not
already available on your machine) and runs this image as a separate container.
This means that:
* You'll have separate Jenkins and Maven containers running locally in Docker.
* The Maven container becomes the link:/doc/book/glossary/#agent[agent] that
  Jenkins uses to run your Pipeline project. However, this container is
  short-lived - its lifespan is only that of the duration of your Pipeline's
  execution.
<2> This `args` parameter creates a reciprocal mapping between the `/root/.m2`
(i.e. Maven repository) directories in the short-lived Maven Docker container
and that of your Docker host's filesystem. Explaining the details behind this is
beyond the scope of this tutorial. However, the main reason for doing this is to
ensure that the artifacts necessary to build your Java application (which Maven
downloads while your Pipeline is being executed) are retained in the Maven
repository beyond the lifespan of the Maven container. This prevents Maven from
having to download the same artifacts during successive runs of your Jenkins
Pipeline, which you'll be conducting later on. Be aware that unlike the Docker
data volume you created for `jenkins-data`
<<download-and-run-jenkins-in-docker,above>>, the Docker host's filesystem is
effectively cleared out each time Docker is restarted. This means you'll lose
the downloaded Maven repository artifacts each time Docker restarts.
<3> Defines a link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#stage[`stage`] (directive) called
`Build` that appears on the Jenkins UI.
<4> This
link:/doc/pipeline/steps/workflow-durable-task-step/#code-sh-code-shell-script[`sh`]
step (of the link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#steps[`steps`] section) runs the
Maven command to cleanly build your Java application (without running any
tests).
. Save your edited `Jenkinsfile` and commit it to your local
  `simple-java-maven-app` Git repository. E.g. Within the
  `simple-java-maven-app` directory, run the commands: +
  `git add .` +
  then +
  `git commit -m "Add initial Jenkinsfile"`
. Go back to Jenkins again, log in again if necessary and click *Open Blue
  Ocean* on the left to access Jenkins's Blue Ocean interface.
. In the *This job has not been run* message box, click *Run*, then quickly
  click the *OPEN* link which appears briefly at the lower-right to see Jenkins
  running your Pipeline project. If you weren't able to click the *OPEN* link,
  click the row on the main Blue Ocean interface to access this feature. +
  *Note:* You may need to wait several minutes for this first run to complete.
  After making a clone of your local `simple-java-maven-app` Git repository
  itself, Jenkins:
.. Initially queues the project to be run on the agent.
.. Downloads the Maven Docker image and runs it in a container on Docker.
+
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/java-maven-01-downloading-maven-docker-image.png[alt="Downloading
Maven Docker image",width=100%]
.. Runs the `Build` stage (defined in the `Jenkinsfile`) on the Maven container.
   During this time, Maven downloads many artifacts necessary to build your Java
   application, which will ultimately be stored in Jenkins's local Maven
   repository (in the Docker host's filesystem).

=== Add a test stage to your Pipeline

. Go back to your text editor/IDE and ensure your `Jenkinsfile` is open.
. Copy and paste the following Declarative Pipeline syntax immediately under the
  `Build` stage of your `Jenkinsfile`:
+
[source,groovy]
----
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
            post {
                always {
                    junit 'target/surefire-reports/*.xml'
                }
            }
        }
----
so that you end up with:
+
[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker {
            image 'maven:3.8.1-adoptopenjdk-11'
            args '-v /root/.m2:/root/.m2'
        }
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn -B -DskipTests clean package'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') { // <1>
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test' // <2>
            }
            post {
                always {
                    junit 'target/surefire-reports/*.xml' // <3>
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
----
<1> Defines a link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#stage[`stage`] (directive) called
`Test` that appears on the Jenkins UI.
<2> This
link:/doc/pipeline/steps/workflow-durable-task-step/#code-sh-code-shell-script[`sh`]
step (of the link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#steps[`steps`] section) executes
the Maven command to run the unit test on your simple Java application. This
command also generates a JUnit XML report, which is saved to the
`target/surefire-reports` directory (within the
`/var/jenkins_home/workspace/simple-java-maven-app` directory in the Jenkins
container).
<3> This
link:/doc/pipeline/steps/junit/#code-junit-code-archive-junit-formatted-test-results[`junit`]
step (provided by the link:/doc/pipeline/steps/junit[JUnit Plugin]) archives the
JUnit XML report (generated by the `mvn test` command above) and exposes the
results through the Jenkins interface. In Blue Ocean, the results are accessible
through the *Tests* page of a Pipeline run. The
link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#post[`post`] section's `always` condition that
contains this `junit` step ensures that the step is _always_ executed _at the
completion_ of the `Test` stage, regardless of the stage's outcome.
. Save your edited `Jenkinsfile` and commit it to your local
  `simple-java-maven-app` Git repository. E.g. Within the
  `simple-java-maven-app` directory, run the commands: +
  `git stage .` +
  then +
  `git commit -m "Add 'Test' stage"`
. Go back to Jenkins again, log in again if necessary and ensure you've accessed
  Jenkins's Blue Ocean interface.
. Click *Run* at the top left, then quickly click the *OPEN* link which appears
  briefly at the lower-right to see Jenkins running your amended Pipeline
  project. If you weren't able to click the **OPEN** link, click the _top_ row
  on the Blue Ocean interface to access this feature. +
  *Note:* You'll notice from this run that Jenkins no longer needs to download
  the Maven Docker image. Instead, Jenkins only needs to run a new container
  from the Maven image downloaded previously. Also, if Docker had not restarted
  since you last ran the Pipeline <<create-your-initial-pipeline-as-a-jenkinsfile,above>>,
  then no Maven artifacts need to be downloaded during the "Build" stage.
  Therefore, running your Pipeline this subsequent time should be much faster. +
  If your amended Pipeline ran successfully, here's what the Blue Ocean
  interface should look like. Notice the additional "Test" stage. You can click
  on the previous "Build" stage circle to access the output from that stage.

. Click the *X* at the top-right to return to the main Blue Ocean interface.


=== Add a final deliver stage to your Pipeline

. Go back to your text editor/IDE and ensure your `Jenkinsfile` is open.
. Copy and paste the following Declarative Pipeline syntax immediately under the
  `Test` stage of your `Jenkinsfile`:
+
[source,groovy]
----
        stage('Deliver') {
            steps {
                sh './jenkins/scripts/deliver.sh'
            }
        }
----
and add a `skipStagesAfterUnstable` option so that you end up with:
+
[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker {
            image 'maven:3.8.1-adoptopenjdk-11'
            args '-v /root/.m2:/root/.m2'
        }
    }
    options {
        skipStagesAfterUnstable()
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn -B -DskipTests clean package'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
            post {
                always {
                    junit 'target/surefire-reports/*.xml'
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Deliver') { // <1>
            steps {
                sh './jenkins/scripts/deliver.sh' // <2>
            }
        }
    }
}
----
<1> Defines a new stage called `Deliver` that appears on the Jenkins UI.
<2> This
link:/doc/pipeline/steps/workflow-durable-task-step/#code-sh-code-shell-script[`sh`]
step (of the link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#steps[`steps`] section) runs the
shell script `deliver.sh` located in the `jenkins/scripts` directory from the
root of the `simple-java-maven-app` repository. Explanations about what this
script does are covered in the `deliver.sh` file itself. As a general principle,
it's a good idea to keep your Pipeline code (i.e. the `Jenkinsfile`) as tidy as
possible and place more complex build steps (particularly for stages consisting
of 2 or more steps) into separate shell script files like the `deliver.sh` file.
This ultimately makes maintaining your Pipeline code easier, especially if your
Pipeline gains more complexity.
. Save your edited `Jenkinsfile` and commit it to your local
  `simple-java-maven-app` Git repository. E.g. Within the
  `simple-java-maven-app` directory, run the commands: +
  `git stage .` +
  then +
  `git commit -m "Add 'Deliver' stage"`
. Go back to Jenkins again, log in again if necessary and ensure you've accessed
  Jenkins's Blue Ocean interface.

=== Wrapping up

Well done! You've just used Jenkins to build a simple Java application with
Maven!

The "Build", "Test" and "Deliver" stages you created above are the basis for
building more complex Java applications with Maven in Jenkins, as well as Java
and Maven applications that integrate with other technology stacks.

Because Jenkins is extremely extensible, it can be modified and configured to
handle practically any aspect of build orchestration and automation.

To learn more about what Jenkins can do, check out:

* The link:/doc/tutorials[Tutorials overview] page for other introductory
  tutorials.
* The link:/doc/book[User Handbook] for more detailed information about using
  Jenkins, such as link:/doc/book/pipeline[Pipelines] (in particular
  link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax[Pipeline syntax]) and the
  link:/doc/book/blueocean[Blue Ocean] interface.
* The link:/node[Jenkins blog] for the latest events, other tutorials and
  updates.

Hide this warning due to temporary addition to 'mvn jar:jar install:install'
fix implemented.
*Warning:* It's possible that since Maven downloads artifacts during this final
`Deliver` stage, Maven will attempt to run some of the other commands further
down the `sh` step before the artifacts have finished downloading. This will
cause the build to fail. If you notice the build failing the first time, run
the Pipeline project again and it should succeed.
