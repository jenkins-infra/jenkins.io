=== Download and run Jenkins in Docker

In this tutorial, you'll be running Jenkins as a Docker container from a Docker
image of Jenkins with Blue Ocean (pre-bundled). Read more about these concepts
in the Docker documentation's https://docs.docker.com/get-started/[Getting
Started, Part 1: Orientation and setup] page and the
https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/[Docker overview] page for an
extensive overview of Docker's capabilities.

*Tip:* If you've already run though this procedure (perhaps from link:..[another
introductory tutorial]), then you can skip this section and
<<fork-and-clone-the-sample-repository-on-github,jump to the next>>. However,
if it's been a while since you last ran through this procedure, then it is
recommended that you run through it again to acquire any updates to this Docker
image.

. Open up a terminal/command prompt window.
. Pull the https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkinsci/blueocean/[latest Docker image for
Jenkins with Blue Ocean (pre-bundled)] by running the command: +
  `docker pull jenkinsci/blueocean` +
  This command downloads the latest Docker image for Jenkins, with Blue Ocean,
  that will run Jenkins as a container in your locally running Docker instance
  (also known as your Docker host).
. Create the following Docker data volume that will be used to persistently
store all data in the Jenkins home directory (explained in a bit more detail
later) by running the command: +
  `docker volume create jenkins-data` +
  *Note:* This data volume allows you to shut down Docker (for example, part way
  through the tutorial) without you losing any work you've already done.
. To run Jenkins, start the downloaded Jenkins/Blue Ocean Docker image as a
  Docker container using the appropriate command:
** *On macOS and Linux:*
+
[source]
----
docker run \
  --rm \  # <1>
  -u root \ # <2>
  -p 8080:8080 \ # <3>
  -v jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home \ # <4>
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v "$HOME":/home \ # <5>
  jenkinsci/blueocean
----
<1> Automatically removes the Docker container (which is the instantiation of
this Jenkins/Blue Ocean Docker image) when it is shut down. This keeps things
tidy if you need to quit Jenkins.
<2> Sets the default user within the container to be root. This is not
recommended practice for running Docker containers in production. However, for
the sake of this tutorial, this is fine.
<3> Makes the Jenkins/Blue Ocean Docker container accessible through port 8080.
<4> Maps the `jenkins-data` data volume
(which you created in the previous step) with the `/var/jenkins_home` directory
in the container.
<5> Maps the `$HOME` directory on the host (i.e. your local) machine (usually
the `/Users/<your-username>` directory) to the `/home` directory in the
container.
+
*Note:* If copying and pasting the command snippet above doesn't work, try
copying and pasting this annotation-free version here:
+
[source]
----
docker run \
  --rm \
  -u root \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v "$HOME":/home \
  jenkinsci/blueocean
----

+
** *On Windows:* +
  The following command is effectively the same command shown for macOS/Linux
  above but the `-v "$HOME":/home` is replaced with `-v "%HOMEPATH%":/home`
  (assuming that your user home directory on Windows is on the C drive). Also,
  if you're using the Windows command prompt, replace the backslash symbols `\`
  at the end of each line with carat symbols instead `^`, giving you:
+
----
docker run --rm ^
  -u root ^
  -p 8080:8080 ^
  -v jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home ^
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ^
  -v "%HOMEPATH%":/home ^
  jenkinsci/blueocean
----
+

+
If you have some experience with Docker, you can add an option like `--name
jenkins-tutorials`, which would give the Jenkins/Blue Ocean Docker container the
name "jenkins-tutorials". This makes it easier to refer to the container if, for
instance you wish to access the container through a terminal/command prompt.

+
. After the 2 sets of asterisks appear in the terminal/command prompt window,
  browse to `http://localhost:8080` and wait until the *Unlock Jenkins* page
  appears. +
  image:tutorials/setup-jenkins-01-unlock-jenkins-page.jpg[alt="Unlock Jenkins
  page",width=100%] +
. From your terminal/command prompt window again, copy the
  automatically-generated alphanumeric password (between the 2 sets of
  asterisks). +
  image:tutorials/setup-jenkins-02-copying-initial-admin-password.png[alt="Copying
  initial admin password",width=100%] +
. On the *Unlock Jenkins* page, paste this password in the *Administrator
  password* field and click *Continue*.
. On the *Customize Jenkins* page, click *Install suggested plugins*. The
  *Getting Started* page is displayed, showing the progression of Jenkins being
  configured and the suggested plugins being installed. (This process may take a
  few minutes.)
. When the *Create First Admin User* page appears, specify your details in the
  respective fields and click *Save and Finish*.
. When the *Jenkins is almost ready!* page appears, click *Restart*. +
  *Note:* If the page doesn't change after a minute, use your web browser to
  refresh the page manually.

Throughout the remainder of this tutorial, you can stop the Jenkins/Blue Ocean
Docker container by typing `Ctrl-C` in the terminal/command prompt window from
which you ran the `docker run ...` command above.

To restart the Jenkins/Blue Ocean Docker container, run the same `docker run
...` command you ran in step 4 (above).


[NOTE]
====
If you don't wish to run Jenkins in Docker, you can run Jenkins locally on your
machine by:

. Ensuring you have a Java 8 Runtime Environment (JRE) or Java
  Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine (in addition to meeting the
  <<prerequisites,prerequisites above>>).
. Downloading the http://mirrors.jenkins.io/war-stable/latest/jenkins.war[latest
  stable Jenkins WAR file] to an appropriate directory on your machine.
. Opening up a terminal/command prompt window to the download directory.
. Running `java -jar jenkins.war`.
. Browsing to `http://localhost:8080`.
. Following the instructions to complete the installation.

This process does not automatically install the Blue Ocean features,
which would need to installed separately via the
link:../../book/managing[**Manage Jenkins**] >
link:../../book/managing/plugins/[**Manage Plugins**] page in Jenkins. Read more
about the specifics for installing Blue Ocean on the
link:../../book/blueocean/getting-started/[Getting Started with Blue Ocean]
page.
