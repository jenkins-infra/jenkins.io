This tutorial shows you how to use Jenkins to orchestrate building a simple
https://nodejs.org/en/[Node.js] and https://reactjs.org/[React] application
with the https://www.npmjs.com/[Node Package Manager (npm)].

If you are a Node.js and React developer who is new to CI/CD concepts, or you
might be familiar with these concepts but don't know how to implement building
your application using Jenkins, then this tutorial is for you.

The simple Node.js and React application (which you'll obtain from a sample
repository on GitHub) generates a web page with the content "Welcome to React"
and is accompanied by a test to check that the application renders
satisfactorily.

*Duration:* This tutorial takes 20-40 minutes to complete (assuming you've
already met the <<prerequisites,prerequisites>> below). The exact duration will
depend on the speed of your machine and whether or not you've already
<<run-jenkins-in-docker,run Jenkins in Docker>> from link:..[another tutorial].

You can stop this tutorial at any point in time and continue from where you left
off.

If you've already run though link:..[another tutorial], you can skip the
<<prerequisites,Prerequisites>> and <<run-jenkins-in-docker,Run Jenkins in
Docker>> sections below and proceed on to <<fork-sample-repository,forking the
sample repository>>. (Just ensure you have
link:https://git-scm.com/downloads[Git] installed locally.) If you need to
restart Jenkins, simply follow the restart instructions in
<<stopping-and-restarting-jenkins,Stopping and restarting Jenkins>> and then
proceed on.

[[fork-sample-repository]]
[[fork-and-clone-the-sample-repository-on-github]]
=== Fork and clone the sample repository

Obtain the simple "Welcome to React" Node.js and React application from GitHub,
by forking the sample repository of the application's source code into your own
GitHub account and then cloning this fork locally.

. Ensure you are signed in to your GitHub account. If you don't yet have a
  GitHub account, sign up for a free one on the https://github.com/[GitHub
  website].
. Fork the
  https://github.com/jenkins-docs/simple-node-js-react-npm-app[`simple-node-js-react-npm-app`]
  on GitHub into your local GitHub account. If you need help with this process,
  refer to the https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/[Fork A Repo]
  documentation on the GitHub website for more information.
. Clone your forked `simple-node-js-react-npm-app` repository (on GitHub)
  locally to your machine. To begin this process, do either of the following
  (where `<your-username>` is the name of your user account on your operating
  system):
** If you have the GitHub Desktop app installed on your machine:
.. In GitHub, click the green *Clone or download* button on your forked
   repository, then *Open in Desktop*.
.. In GitHub Desktop, before clicking *Clone* on the *Clone a Repository* dialog
   box, ensure *Local Path* for:
*** macOS is `/Users/<your-username>/Documents/GitHub/simple-node-js-react-npm-app`
*** Linux is `/home/<your-username>/GitHub/simple-node-js-react-npm-app`
*** Windows is `C:\Users\<your-username>\Documents\GitHub\simple-node-js-react-npm-app`
** Otherwise:
.. Open up a terminal/command line prompt and `cd` to the appropriate directory
   on:
*** macOS - `/Users/<your-username>/Documents/GitHub/`
*** Linux - `/home/<your-username>/GitHub/`
*** Windows - `C:\Users\<your-username>\Documents\GitHub\` (although use a Git
    bash command line window as opposed to the usual Microsoft command prompt)
.. Run the following command to continue/complete cloning your forked repo: +
   `git clone \https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-ACCOUNT-NAME/simple-node-js-react-npm-app` +
   where `YOUR-GITHUB-ACCOUNT-NAME` is the name of your GitHub account.


=== Create your Pipeline project in Jenkins

. Go back to Jenkins, log in again if necessary and click *create new jobs*
  under *Welcome to Jenkins!* +
  *Note:* If you don't see this, click *New Item* at the top left.
. In the *Enter an item name* field, specify the name for your new Pipeline
  project (e.g. `simple-node-js-react-npm-app`).
. Scroll down and click *Pipeline*, then click *OK* at the end of the page.
. ( _Optional_ ) On the next page, specify a brief description for your Pipeline
  in the *Description* field (e.g. `An entry-level Pipeline demonstrating how to
  use Jenkins to build a simple Node.js and React application with npm.`)
. Click the *Pipeline* tab at the top of the page to scroll down to the
  *Pipeline* section.
. From the *Definition* field, choose the *Pipeline script from SCM* option.
  This option instructs Jenkins to obtain your Pipeline from Source Control
  Management (SCM), which will be your locally cloned Git repository.
. From the *SCM* field, choose *Git*.
. In the *Repository URL* field, specify the directory path of your locally
  cloned repository <<fork-sample-repository,above>>,
  which is from your user account/home directory on your host machine, mapped to
  the `/home` directory of the Jenkins container - i.e.
* For macOS - `/home/Documents/GitHub/simple-node-js-react-npm-app`
* For Linux - `/home/GitHub/simple-node-js-react-npm-app`
* For Windows - `/home/Documents/GitHub/simple-node-js-react-npm-app`
. Click *Save* to save your new Pipeline project. You're now ready to begin
  creating your `Jenkinsfile`, which you'll be checking into your locally cloned
  Git repository.


=== Create your initial Pipeline as a Jenkinsfile

You're now ready to create your Pipeline that will automate building your
Node.js and React application in Jenkins. Your Pipeline will be created as a
`Jenkinsfile`, which will be committed to your locally cloned Git repository
(`simple-node-js-react-npm-app`).

This is the foundation of "Pipeline-as-Code", which treats the continuous
delivery pipeline as a part of the application to be versioned and reviewed like
any other code. Read more about Pipeline and what a Jenkinsfile is in the
link:/doc/book/pipeline[Pipeline] and link:/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile[Using
a Jenkinsfile] sections of the User Handbook.

First, create an initial Pipeline to download a Node Docker image and run it as
a Docker container (which will build your simple Node.js and React application).
Also add a "Build" stage to the Pipeline that begins orchestrating this whole
process.

. Using your favorite text editor or IDE, create and save new text file with the
  name `Jenkinsfile` at the root of your local `simple-node-js-react-npm-app`
  Git repository.
. Copy the following Declarative Pipeline code and paste it into your empty
  `Jenkinsfile`:
+
[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker {
            image 'node:lts-buster-slim' // <1>
            args '-p 3000:3000' // <2>
        }
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') { // <3>
            steps {
                sh 'npm install' // <4>
            }
        }
    }
}
----
<1> This `image` parameter (of the link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax#agent[`agent`]
section's `docker` parameter) downloads the
https://hub.docker.com/_/node/[`node:lts-buster-slim` Docker image] (if it's not
already available on your machine) and runs this image as a separate container.
This means that:
* You'll have separate Jenkins and Node containers running locally in Docker.
* The Node container becomes the link:/doc/book/glossary/#agent[agent] that
  Jenkins uses to run your Pipeline project. However, this container is
  short-lived - its lifespan is only that of the duration of your Pipeline's
  execution.
<2> This `args` parameter makes the Node container (temporarily) accessible
through port 3000. The significance of this is explained in the
`jenkins/scripts/deliver.sh` file of your cloned repository, and is covered in a
subsequent section of this tutorial.
<3> Defines a link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#stage[`stage`] (directive) called
`Build` that appears on the Jenkins UI.
<4> This
link:/doc/pipeline/steps/workflow-durable-task-step/#code-sh-code-shell-script[`sh`]
step (of the link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#steps[`steps`] section) executes
the `npm` command to ensure that all dependencies required to run your
application have been downloaded to the `node_modules` workspace directory
(within the `/var/jenkins_home/workspace/simple-node-js-react-npm-app` directory
in the Jenkins container).
. Save your edited `Jenkinsfile` and commit it to your local
  `simple-node-js-react-npm-app` Git repository. E.g. Within the
  `simple-node-js-react-npm-app` directory, run the commands: +
  `git add .` +
  then +
  `git commit -m "Add initial Jenkinsfile"`
. Go back to Jenkins again, log in again if necessary and click *Open Blue
  Ocean* on the left to access Jenkins's Blue Ocean interface.
. In the *This job has not been run* message box, click *Run*, then quickly
  click the *OPEN* link which appears briefly at the lower-right to see Jenkins
  building your Pipeline project. If you weren't able to click the *OPEN* link,
  click the row on the main Blue Ocean interface to access this feature. +
  *Note:* You may need to wait several minutes for this first run to complete.
  After making a clone of your local `simple-node-js-react-npm-app` Git
  repository itself, Jenkins:
.. Initially queues the project to be run on the agent.
.. Downloads the Node Docker image and runs it in a container on Docker.
+
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/node-js-react-01-downloading-node-docker-image.png[alt="Downloading
Node Docker image",width=100%]
.. Runs the `Build` stage (defined in the `Jenkinsfile`) on the Node container.
   During this time, `npm` downloads many dependencies necessary to run your
   Node.js and React application, which will ultimately be stored in the
   `node_modules` workspace directory (within the Jenkins home directory).
+
[.boxshadow]

The Blue Ocean interface turns green if Jenkins built your Node.js and React
application successfully.

=== Add a test stage to your Pipeline

. Go back to your text editor/IDE and ensure your `Jenkinsfile` is open.
. Copy and paste the following Declarative Pipeline syntax immediately under the
  `agent` section of your `Jenkinsfile`:
+
[source,groovy]
----
    environment {
        CI = 'true'
    }
----
as well as the following immediately under the `Build` stage:
+
[source,groovy]
----
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh './jenkins/scripts/test.sh'
            }
        }
----
so that you end up with:
+
[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker {
            image 'node:lts-buster-slim'
            args '-p 3000:3000'
        }
    }
    environment {
        CI = 'true' // <1>
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm install'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') { // <2>
            steps {
                sh './jenkins/scripts/test.sh' // <3>
            }
        }
    }
}
----
<1> The link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax#environment[`environment`] directive sets
the environment variable `CI` with a boolean value of `true`, which is available
to all steps in this Pipeline. When the `npm test` command in `test.sh` (which
is run during the `Test` stage defined further down the Pipeline) detects the
environment variable `CI` with a value of `true`, then this command is run in
"non-watch" (i.e. non-interactive) mode. In "watch" mode, `npm test` expects
user input, which can pause running builds of CI/CD applications indefinitely.
As an alternative to specifying the `environment` directive in a Jenkins
Pipeline, you could also specify this environment variable in the `package.json`
file (to pass on to the `npm test` command) by:
.. Uncommenting the `npm install --save-dev cross-env` command in
   `jenkins/scripts/test.sh` (to install the `cross-env` dependency during the
   `Test` stage). Read more about this in the `test.sh` file itself.
.. Updating the following line in the `package.json` file (at the root of the
   `simple-node-js-react-npm-app` repository) from:
   * `"test": "react-scripts test --env=jsdom",` +
     to
   * `"test": "cross-env CI=true react-scripts test --env=jsdom",`
<2> Defines a link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#stage[`stage`] (directive) called
`Test` that appears on the Jenkins UI.
<3> This
link:/doc/pipeline/steps/workflow-durable-task-step/#code-sh-code-shell-script[`sh`]
step (of the link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#steps[`steps`] section) runs the
shell script `test.sh` located in the `jenkins/scripts` directory from the root
of the `simple-node-js-react-npm-app` repository. Explanations about what this
script does are covered in the `test.sh` file itself. As a general principle,
it's a good idea to keep your Pipeline code (i.e. the `Jenkinsfile`) as tidy as
possible and place more complex build scripting steps into separate shell script
files like the `test.sh` file. This ultimately facilitates the maintenance of
your Pipeline, especially if it gains more complexity.
. Save your edited `Jenkinsfile` and commit it to your local
  `simple-node-js-react-npm-app` Git repository. E.g. Within the
  `simple-node-js-react-npm-app` directory, run the commands: +
  `git stage .` +
  then +
  `git commit -m "Add 'Test' stage"`
. Go back to Jenkins again, log in again if necessary and ensure you've accessed
  Jenkins's Blue Ocean interface.
. Click *Run* at the top left, then quickly click the *OPEN* link which appears
  briefly at the lower-right to see Jenkins running your amended Pipeline
  project. If you weren't able to click the **OPEN** link, click the _top_ row
  on the Blue Ocean interface to access this feature. +
  *Note:* You'll notice from this run that Jenkins no longer needs to download
  the Node Docker image. Instead, Jenkins only needs to run a new container from
  the Node image downloaded previously. Also, from now on, no (new) `npm`
  dependencies should need to be downloaded during the "Build" stage. Therefore,
  running your Pipeline this subsequent time should be much faster. +
  If your amended Pipeline ran successfully, here's what the Blue Ocean
  interface should look like. Notice the additional "Test" stage. You can click
  on the previous "Build" stage circle to access the output from that stage.
[.boxshadow]

. Click the *X* at the top-right to return to the main Blue Ocean interface.


=== Add a final deliver stage to your Pipeline

. Go back to your text editor/IDE and ensure your `Jenkinsfile` is open.
. Copy and paste the following Declarative Pipeline syntax immediately under the
  `Test` stage of your `Jenkinsfile`:
+
[source,groovy]
----
        stage('Deliver') {
            steps {
                sh './jenkins/scripts/deliver.sh'
                input message: 'Finished using the web site? (Click "Proceed" to continue)'
                sh './jenkins/scripts/kill.sh'
            }
        }
----
so that you end up with:
+
[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker {
            image 'node:lts-buster-slim'
            args '-p 3000:3000'
        }
    }
    environment { // <1>
        CI = 'true'
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm install'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh './jenkins/scripts/test.sh'
            }
        }
        stage('Deliver') { // <2>
            steps {
                sh './jenkins/scripts/deliver.sh' // <3>
                input message: 'Finished using the web site? (Click "Proceed" to continue)' // <4>
                sh './jenkins/scripts/kill.sh' // <5>
            }
        }
    }
}
----
<1> This link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax#environment[`environment`] directive
might not be present in your Pipeline if you chose to specify the `CI`
environment variable in the `package.json` file
<<add-a-test-stage-to-your-pipeline,above>>.
<2> Defines a new stage called `Deliver` that appears on the Jenkins UI.
<3> This
link:/doc/pipeline/steps/workflow-durable-task-step/#code-sh-code-shell-script[`sh`]
step (of the link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#steps[`steps`] section) runs the
shell script `deliver.sh` located in the `jenkins/scripts` directory from the
root of the `simple-node-js-react-npm-app` repository. Explanations about what
this script does are covered in the `deliver.sh` file itself.
<4> This
link:/doc/pipeline/steps/pipeline-input-step/#code-input-code-wait-for-interactive-input[`input`]
step (provided by the link:/doc/pipeline/steps/pipeline-input-step[Pipeline:
Input Step] plugin) pauses the running build and prompts the user (with a custom
message) to proceed or abort.
<5> This
link:/doc/pipeline/steps/workflow-durable-task-step/#code-sh-code-shell-script[`sh`]
step runs the shell script `kill.sh`, also located in the `jenkins/scripts`
directory. Explanations about what this script does are covered in the `kill.sh`
file itself.
. Save your edited `Jenkinsfile` and commit it to your local
  `simple-node-js-react-npm-app` Git repository. E.g. Within the
  `simple-node-js-react-npm-app` directory, run the commands: +
  `git stage .` +
  then +
  `git commit -m "Add 'Deliver' stage"`
. Go back to Jenkins again, log in again if necessary and ensure you've accessed
  Jenkins's Blue Ocean interface.
. Click *Run* at the top left, then quickly click the *OPEN* link which appears
  briefly at the lower-right to see Jenkins running your amended Pipeline
  project. If you weren't able to click the **OPEN** link, click the _top_ row
  on the Blue Ocean interface to access this feature. +
  If your amended Pipeline ran successfully, here's what the Blue Ocean
  interface should look like. Notice the additional "Deliver" stage. Click on
  the previous "Test" and "Build" stage circles to access the outputs from those
  stages.
+
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/node-js-react-21-deliver-stage-pauses-for-user-input.png[alt="Deliver
stage pauses for user input",width=100%]
. Ensure you are viewing the "Deliver" stage (click it if necessary), then click
  the green *`./jenkins/scripts/deliver.sh`* step to expand its content and
  scroll down until you see the `\http://localhost:3000` link.
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/node-js-react-22-deliver-stage-opened-deliver-sh-step.png[alt="Deliver

. Click the `\http://localhost:3000` link to view your Node.js and React
  application running (in development mode) in a new web browser tab. You should
  see a page/site with the title *Welcome to React* on it. +
  *Tip:* If you're feeling a little adventurous, you can try accessing the
  terminal/command prompt of your Jenkins Docker container, then using vi
  editor, tweak and save the `App.js` source file and see the results appear on
  the *Welcome to React* page. To do this, run the following commands:
+
[source]
----
docker exec -it <docker-container-name> bash # <1>
cd /var/jenkins_home/workspace/simple-node-js-react-npm-app/src # <2>
vi App.js # <3>
----
<1> This command provides access to the terminal/command prompt of your Jenkins
Docker container. The `<docker-container-name>` can be obtained using the
command `docker ps`. Otherwise, it would be `jenkins-tutorials` (if you
specified this in the command you used to run this container
<<run-jenkins-in-docker,above>> - i.e. `--name jenkins-tutorials`).
<2> Once in the container, change directory to the Node.js and React source
directory (in the Jenkins workspace directory within Jenkins home).
<3> Access, edit and save changes to your application's `App.js` file using vi
editor.
. When you are finished viewing the page/site, click the *Proceed* button to
  complete the Pipeline's execution.
+
[.boxshadow]

=== Wrapping up

Well done! You've just used Jenkins to build a simple Node.js and React
application with npm!

The "Build", "Test" and "Deliver" stages you created above are the basis for
building more complex Node.js and React applications in Jenkins, as well as
Node.js and React applications that integrate with other technology stacks.

Because Jenkins is extremely extensible, it can be modified and configured to
handle practically any aspect of build orchestration and automation.
