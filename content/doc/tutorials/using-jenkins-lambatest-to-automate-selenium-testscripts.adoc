[[LamdbaTestPlugin-ConfigureLambdaTestTunnelForLocalTesting]]
== *Configure LambdaTest Tunnel For Local Testing*

**Lambda Tunnel **is a feature of LambdaTest that allows you to perform
cross browser testing on your locally hosted web pages and web apps.
Lambda Tunnel establishes an SSH tunnel between your local machine and
LambdaTest cloud servers to provide you with a testing environment to
ensure cross browser compatibility of a web application before making it
live on the Production environment. The plugin is responsible for
downloading the binary for the platform that the build job is running on
and starting and tearing down the secure tunnel.

Under your Build Environment details, you will find a checkbox to *Use
Local Tunnel*. Provide LambdaTest Credentials under it and hit
the **Add **button before saving the Build Environment details.

We would recommend keeping the LambdaTest Local Path empty, that way,
the plugin will download the LT binary file automatically. However, if
you wish to use a binary by downloading externally then you need to
provide the location of the file as the LambdaTest Local Path. But if
your Jenkins works on the master-slave configuration set up, then it
would be best to leave the path empty for allowing the plugin to
download the relevant binary file with respect to the operating system
of your local machine.
