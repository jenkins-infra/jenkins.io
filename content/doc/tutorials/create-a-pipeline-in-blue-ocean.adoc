This tutorial shows you how to use the link:/doc/book/blueocean/[Blue Ocean]
feature of Jenkins to create a Pipeline that will orchestrate building a simple
application.

Before starting this tutorial, it is recommended that you run through at least
one of the initial set of tutorials from the link:..[Tutorials overview] page
first to familiarize yourself with CI/CD concepts (relevant to a technology
stack you're most familiar with) and how these concepts are implemented in
Jenkins.

This tutorial uses the same application that the
link:../build-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm[Build a Node.js and React app
with npm] tutorial is based on. Therefore, you'll be building the same
application although this time, completely through Blue Ocean. Since Blue Ocean
provides a simplified Git-handling experience, you'll be interacting directly
with the repository on GitHub (as opposed to a local clone of this repository).

*Duration:* This tutorial takes 20-40 minutes to complete (assuming you've
already met the <<prerequisites,prerequisites>> below). The exact duration will
depend on the speed of your machine and whether or not you've already
<<run-jenkins-in-docker,run Jenkins in Docker>> from link:..[another tutorial].

You can stop this tutorial at any point in time and continue from where you left
off.

If you've already run though link:..[another tutorial], you can skip the
<<prerequisites,Prerequisites>> and <<run-jenkins-in-docker,Run Jenkins in
Docker>> sections below and proceed on to <<fork-sample-repository,forking the
sample repository>>. If you need to restart Jenkins, simply follow the restart
instructions in <<stopping-and-restarting-jenkins,Stopping and restarting
Jenkins>> and then proceed on.

[[fork-sample-repository]]
=== Fork the sample repository on GitHub

Fork the simple "Welcome to React" Node.js and React application on GitHub into
your own GitHub account.

. Ensure you are signed in to your GitHub account. If you don't yet have a
  GitHub account, sign up for a free one on the https://github.com/[GitHub
  website].
. Fork the
  https://github.com/jenkins-docs/creating-a-pipeline-in-blue-ocean[`creating-a-pipeline-in-blue-ocean`]
  on GitHub into your local GitHub account. If you need help with this process,
  refer to the https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/[Fork A Repo]
  documentation on the GitHub website for more information. +
  *Note:* This is a different repository to the one used in the
  link:../build-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm[Build a Node.js and React app
  with npm] tutorial. Although these repositories contain the same application
  code, ensure you fork and use the correct one before continuing on.


=== Create your Pipeline project in Blue Ocean

. Go back to Jenkins and ensure you have accessed the Blue Ocean interface. To
  do this, make sure you:
* have browsed to `\http://localhost:8080/blue` and are logged in +
  or
* have browsed to `\http://localhost:8080/`, are logged in and have clicked *Open
  Blue Ocean* on the left.
. In the *Welcome to Jenkins* box at the center of the Blue Ocean interface,
  click *Create a new Pipeline* to begin the Pipeline creation wizard. +
  *Note:* If you don't see this box, click *New Pipeline* at the top right.
. In *Where do you store your code?*, click *GitHub*.
. In *Connect to GitHub*, click *Create an access key here*. This opens GitHub
  in a new browser tab. +
  *Note:* If you previously configured Blue Ocean to connect to GitHub using a
  personal access token, then Blue Ocean takes you directly to step 9
  <<choose-github-account,below>>.
. In the new tab, sign in to your GitHub account (if necessary) and on the
  GitHub *New Personal Access Token* page, specify a brief *Token description*
  for your GitHub access token (e.g. `Blue Ocean`). +
  *Note:* An access token is usually an alphanumeric string that respresents
  your GitHub account along with permissions to access various GitHub features
  and areas through your GitHub account. This access token will have the
  appropriate permissions pre-selected, which Blue Ocean requires to access and
  interact with your GitHub account.
. Scroll down to the end of the page (leaving all other *Select scopes* options
  with their default settings) and click *Generate token*.
. On the resulting *Personal access tokens* page, copy your newly generated
  access token.
. Back in Blue Ocean, paste the access token into the *Your GitHub access token*
  field and click *Connect*. +
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-01-connecting-to-github.png[alt="Connecting
to GitHub",width=80%] +
  [[choose-github-account]]Jenkins now has access to your GitHub account
  (provided by your access token).
. In *Which organization does the repository belong
  to?*, click your GitHub account (where you forked the repository
  <<fork-sample-repository,above>>).
. In *Choose a repository*, click your forked repository
  *creating-a-pipeline-in-blue-ocean*.
. Click *Create Pipeline*. +
  Blue Ocean detects that there is no Jenkinsfile at the root level of the
  repository's `master` branch and proceed to help you create one. (Therefore,
  you'll need to click another *Create Pipeline* at the end of the page to
  proceed.) +
  *Note:* Under the hood, a Pipeline project created through Blue Ocean is
  actually "multibranch Pipeline". Therefore, Jenkins looks for the presence of
  at least one Jenkinsfile in any branch of your repository.


=== Create your initial Pipeline

. Following on from creating your Pipeline project
  (<<create-your-pipeline-project-in-blue-ocean,above>>), in the Pipeline
  editor, select *docker* from the *Agent* dropdown in the *Pipeline Settings*
  panel on the right. +
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-11-initial-pipeline-editor-page.png[alt="Initial
to GitHub",width=100%]
. In the *Image* and *Args* fields that appear, specify `node:6-alpine` and
  `-p 3000:3000` respectively. +
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-12-agent-section.png[alt="Configuring the
agent",width=50%] +
  *Note:* For an explanation of these values, refer to annotations *1* and *2*
  of the Declarative Pipeline in the
  link:../build-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm/#create-your-initial-pipeline-as-a-jenkinsfile[``Create
  your initial Pipeline...'' section of the Build a Node.js and React app]
  tutorial.
. Back in the main Pipeline editor, click the *+* icon, which opens the new
  stage panel on the right. +
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-13-add-build-stage.png[alt="Add 'Build'
stage",width=30%]
. In this panel, type `Build` in the *Name your stage* field and then click the
  *Add Step* button below, which opens the *Choose step type* panel. +
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-14-adding-the-build-stage.png[alt="Adding
the Build stage",width=50%]
. In this panel, click *Shell Script* near the top of the list (to choose that
  step type), which opens the *Build / Shell Script* panel, where you can enter
  this step's values.
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-15-choosing-a-step-type.png[alt="Choosing a
step type",width=50%] +
  *Tip:* The most commonly used step types appear closest to the top of this
  list. To find other steps further down this list, you can filter this list
  using the *Find steps by name* option.
. In the *Build / Shell Script* panel, specify `npm
  install`. +
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-16-specifying-a-shell-step-value.png[alt="Specifying
a shell step value",width=80%] +
  *Note:* For an explanation of this step, refer to annotation *4* of the
  Declarative Pipeline in the
  link:../build-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm/#create-your-initial-pipeline-as-a-jenkinsfile[``Create your initial Pipeline...`` section of the Build a Node.js and React app]
  tutorial.
. ( _Optional_ ) Click the top-left back arrow icon
  image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-16a-return-from-step-icon.png[alt="Return
  from step icon",width=3%] to return to the main Pipeline editor.
. Click the *Save* button at the top right to begin saving your new Pipeline
  with its "Build" stage.
. In the *Save Pipeline* dialog box, specify the commit message in the
  *Description* field (e.g. `Add initial Pipeline (Jenkinsfile)`).
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-18-save-pipeline-dialog-box.png[alt="Save
Pipeline dialog box",width=70%] +
. Leaving all other options as is, click *Save & run* and Jenkins proceeds to
  build your Pipeline.
. When the main Blue Ocean interface appears, click the row to see Jenkins build
  your Pipeline project. +
  *Note:* You may need to wait several minutes for this first run to complete.
  During this time, Jenkins does the following:
.. Commits your Pipeline as a `Jenkinsfile` to the only branch (i.e. `master`)
   of your repository.
.. Initially queues the project to be built on the agent.
.. Downloads the Node Docker image and runs it in a container on Docker.
.. Executes the `Build` stage (defined in the `Jenkinsfile`) on the Node
   container. (During this time, `npm` downloads many dependencies necessary to
   run your Node.js and React application, which will ultimately be stored in
   the local `node_modules` directory within the Jenkins home directory).
+
[.boxshadow]

'npm' dependencies",width=100%]

+
The Blue Ocean interface turns green if Jenkins built your application
successfully.
[.boxshadow]

Pipeline runs successfully",width=100%]
. Click the *X* at the top-right to return to the main Blue Ocean interface.
+
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-19b-main-blue-ocean-interface.png[alt="Main
Blue Ocean interface",width=100%] +
  *Note:* Before continuing on, you can check that Jenkins has created a
  `Jenkinsfile` for you at the root of your forked GitHub repository (in the
  repository's sole `master` branch).


=== Add a test stage to your Pipeline

. From the main Blue Ocean interface, click *Branches* at the top-right to
  access your repository's branches page, where you can access the `master`
  branch. +
[.boxshadow]

  image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-21a-edit-pipeline-on-branch.png[alt="Edit
  Pipeline on branch",width=3%]
  to open the Pipeline editor for this branch. +
. In the main Pipeline editor, click the *+* icon to the right of the *Build*
  stage you created <<create-your-initial-pipeline,above>> to open the new stage
  panel on the right. +
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-22-add-test-stage.png[alt="Add 'Test'
stage",width=45%]
. In this panel, type `Test` in the *Name your stage* field and then click the
  *Add Step* button below to open the *Choose step type* panel.
. In this panel, click *Shell Script* near the top of the list.
. In the resulting *Test / Shell Script* panel, specify
  `./jenkins/scripts/test.sh` and then click the top-left back arrow icon
  image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-16a-return-from-step-icon.png[alt="Return
  from step icon",width=3%] to return to the Pipeline stage editor. +
. At the lower-right of the panel, click *Settings* to reveal this section of
  the panel.
. Click the *+* icon at the right of the *Environment* heading (for which you'll
  configure an environment directive).
. In the *Name* and *Value* fields that appear, specify `CI` and `true`,
  respectively.
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-23-environment-directive.png[alt="Environment
directive",width=50%] +
  *Note:* For an explanation of this directive and its step, refer to
  annotations *1* and *3* of the Declarative Pipeline in the
  link:../build-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm/#add-a-test-stage-to-your-pipeline[``Add a test stage...`` section of the Build a Node.js and React app]
  tutorial.
. ( _Optional_ ) Click the top-left back arrow icon
  image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-16a-return-from-step-icon.png[alt="Return
  from step icon",width=3%] to return to the main Pipeline editor.
. Click the *Save* button at the top right to begin saving your Pipeline with
  with its new "Test" stage.
. In the *Save Pipeline* dialog box, specify the commit message in the
  *Description* field (e.g. `Add 'Test' stage`).
. Leaving all other options as is, click *Save & run* and Jenkins proceeds to
  build your amended Pipeline.
. When the main Blue Ocean interface appears, click the _top_ row to see Jenkins
  build your Pipeline project. +
  *Note:* You'll notice from this run that Jenkins no longer needs to download
  the Node Docker image. Instead, Jenkins only needs to run a new container from
  the Node image downloaded previously. Therefore, running your Pipeline this
  subsequent time should be much faster. +
  If your amended Pipeline ran successfully, here's what the Blue Ocean
  interface should look like. Notice the additional "Test" stage. You can click
  on the previous "Build" stage circle to access the output from that stage.

Blue Ocean interface with all previous runs displayed",width=100%]


=== Follow up (optional)

If you check the contents of the `Jenkinsfile` that Blue Ocean created at the
root of your forked `creating-a-pipeline-in-blue-ocean` repository, notice the
location of the link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax#environment[`environment`]
directive. This directive's location within the "Test" stage means that the
environment variable `CI` (with its value of `true`) is only available within
the scope of this "Test" stage.

You can set this directive in Blue Ocean so that its environment variable is
available globally throughout Pipeline (as is the case in the
link:../build-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm/[Build a Node.js and React
app with npm] tutorial). To do this:

. From the main Blue Ocean interface, click *Branches* at the top-right to
  access your repository's `master` branch.
. Click the `master` branch's "Edit Pipeline" icon
  image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-21a-edit-pipeline-on-branch.png[alt="Edit
  Pipeline on branch",width=3%] to open the Pipeline editor for this branch.
. In the main Pipeline editor, click the *Test* stage you created
  <<add-a-test-stage-to-your-pipeline,above>> to begin editing it.
. In the stage panel on the right, click *Settings* to reveal this section of
  the panel.
. Click the minus (*-*) icon at the right of the `CI` environment directive (you
  created earlier) to delete it.
. Click the top-left back arrow icon
  image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-16a-return-from-step-icon.png[alt="Return
  from step icon",width=3%] to return to the main Pipeline editor.
. In the *Pipeline Settings* panel, click the *+* icon at the right of the
  *Environment* heading (for which you'll configure a _global_ environment
  directive).
. In the *Name* and *Value* fields that appear, specify `CI` and `true`,
  respectively.
. Click the *Save* button at the top right to begin saving your Pipeline with
  with its relocated environment directive.
. In the *Save Pipeline* dialog box, specify the commit message in the
  *Description* field (e.g. `Make environment directive global`).
. Leaving all other options as is, click *Save & run* and Jenkins proceeds to
  build your amended Pipeline.
. When the main Blue Ocean interface appears, click the _top_ row to see Jenkins
  build your Pipeline project. +
  You should see the same build process you saw when you completed adding the
  final deliver stage (<<add-a-final-deliver-stage-to-your-pipeline,above>>).
  However, when you inspect the `Jenkinsfile` again, you'll notice that the
  `environment` directive is now a sibling of the `agent` section.


=== Wrapping up

Well done! You've just used the Blue Ocean feature of Jenkins to build a simple
Node.js and React application with npm!

The "Build", "Test" and "Deliver" stages you created above are the basis for
building other applications in Jenkins with any technology stack, including
more complex applications and ones that combine multiple technology stacks
together.

Because Jenkins is extremely extensible, it can be modified and configured to
handle practically any aspect of build orchestration and automation.

* The link:/doc/tutorials[Tutorials overview] page for other introductory
  tutorials.
* The link:/doc/book[User Handbook] for more detailed information about using
  Jenkins, such as link:/doc/book/pipeline[Pipelines] (in particular
  link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax[Pipeline syntax]) and the
