This tutorial shows you how to use the link:/doc/book/blueocean/[Blue Ocean] feature of Jenkins to create a Pipeline that orchestrates building a simple application.

Before you start this tutorial, be sure to run through at least one of the initial tutorials from the link:..[tutorials overview] page.
This will help you learn about CI/CD concepts, relevant to the technology stack you're most familiar with, and how these concepts are implemented in Jenkins.

This tutorial uses the same application that the link:../build-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm[build a Node.js and React app with npm] tutorial is based on.
Therefore, you're building the same application, but this time, completely through Blue Ocean.
Since Blue Ocean provides a simplified Git-handling experience, you'll be interacting directly with the repository on GitHub, as opposed to a local clone.

*Duration:* This tutorial takes 20-40 minutes to complete if you've already met the <<prerequisites,prerequisites>> below.
The exact duration depends on the speed of your machine and whether or not you've already <<run-jenkins-in-docker,run Jenkins in Docker>> from link:..[another tutorial].

include::doc/book/blueocean/_blue-ocean-status.adoc[]

You can stop this tutorial at any point in time and continue from where you left
off.

If you've already run though link:..[another tutorial], you can skip the <<prerequisites,prerequisites>> and <<run-jenkins-in-docker,run Jenkins in Docker>> sections below and proceed to <<fork-sample-repository,forking the sample repository>>.
If you need to restart Jenkins, follow the restart instructions in <<stopping-and-restarting-jenkins,stopping and restarting Jenkins>> and then proceed.

[[fork-sample-repository]]
== Fork the sample repository on GitHub

Fork the simple "Welcome to React" Node.js and React application on GitHub into your own GitHub account.

. Ensure you are signed in to your GitHub account.
If you don't yet have a GitHub account, sign up for a free on the https://github.com/[GitHub website].
. Fork the https://github.com/jenkins-docs/creating-a-pipeline-in-blue-ocean[`creating-a-pipeline-in-blue-ocean`]
repository on GitHub into your local GitHub account.
If you need help with this process, refer to the https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/[fork a repo] documentation on the GitHub website for more information.

NOTE: This is a different repository than the one used in the link:../build-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm[build a Node.js and React app with npm] tutorial.
Although these repositories contain the same application code, ensure you fork and use the correct one before continuing.


== Create your Pipeline project in Blue Ocean

. Go back to Jenkins and ensure you have accessed the Blue Ocean interface.
To do this, make sure you have:
* browsed to `\http://localhost:8080/blue` and are logged in.
* browsed to `\http://localhost:8080/`, are logged in, and have selected *Open Blue Ocean* on the left side of the screen.

. In the *Welcome to Jenkins* box at the center of the Blue Ocean interface, select *Create a new Pipeline* to start the Pipeline creation wizard.
If you don't see this box, select *New Pipeline* in the upper right.

. In *Where do you store your code?*, select *GitHub*.
. In *Connect to GitHub*, select *Create an access key here*.
This opens GitHub in a new browser tab.
+
NOTE: If you previously configured Blue Ocean to connect to GitHub using a personal access token, Blue Ocean takes you directly to step 9 <<choose-github-account,below>>.

. In the new tab, sign in to your GitHub account if necessary. On the GitHub *New Personal Access Token* page, specify a brief *Token description* for your GitHub access token, for example `Blue Ocean`.
+
TIP: An access token is usually an alphanumeric string that represents your GitHub account, along with permissions to access various GitHub features and areas through your account.
This access token has the appropriate permissions pre-selected that Blue Ocean requires to access and interact with your GitHub account.

. Scroll down to the end of the page, while leaving all other *Select scopes* options with their default settings, and select *Generate token*.
. On the *Personal access tokens* page, copy your newly-generated access token.
. Back in Blue Ocean, paste the access token into the *Your GitHub access token* field, and select *Connect*.
+
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-01-connecting-to-github.png[alt="Connecting to GitHub",width=80%]
+
[[choose-github-account]]Jenkins now has access to your GitHub account, using your access token.
. In *Which organization does the repository belong to?*, select your GitHub account where you forked the repository <<fork-sample-repository,above>>.
. In *Choose a repository*, select your forked repository `creating-a-pipeline-in-blue-ocean`.
. Select *Create Pipeline*.
* Blue Ocean detects that there is no Jenkinsfile at the root level of the repository's `master` branch and helps you create one.
You must select *Create Pipeline* again at the end of the page to proceed.

TIP: Under the hood, a Pipeline project created through Blue Ocean is actually a "multibranch Pipeline".
Therefore, Jenkins looks for the presence of at least one Jenkinsfile in any branch of your repository.

=== Create your initial Pipeline

. Following on from creating your Pipeline project <<create-your-pipeline-project-in-blue-ocean,above>>, in the Pipeline editor, select *Docker* from the *Agent* dropdown in the *Pipeline Settings* panel on the right side of the page.
+
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-11-initial-pipeline-editor-page.png[alt="Initial to GitHub",width=100%]
. In the *Image* and *Args* fields that appear, specify `node:lts-alpine` and `-p 3000:3000` respectively.
+
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-12-agent-section.png[alt="Configuring the agent",width=50%]
+
NOTE: For an explanation of these values, refer to annotations *1* and *2* of the Declarative Pipeline in the
link:../build-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm/#create-your-initial-pipeline-as-a-jenkinsfile["Create your initial Pipeline..."] section of the build a Node.js and React app tutorial.

. In the main Pipeline editor, select the *+* icon, to open the new stage panel on the right side of the icon.
+
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-13-add-build-stage.png[alt="Add 'Build' stage",width=30%]

. In this panel, enter `Build` in the *Name your stage* field, and then select the *Add Step* button below.
The *Choose step type* panel opens.
+
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-14-adding-the-build-stage.png[alt="Adding the Build stage",width=50%]

. In this panel, select *Shell Script* near the top of the list to configure that step type, which opens the *Build / Shell Script* panel. 
Here you can enter this step's values.
+
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-15-choosing-a-step-type.png[alt="Choosing a step type",width=50%]
+
TIP: The most commonly used step types appear closest to the top of this list. 
To find other steps further down this list, you can filter this list using the *Find steps by name* option.

. In the *Build / Shell Script* panel, specify `npm install`.
+
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-16-specifying-a-shell-step-value.png[alt="Specifying a shell step value",width=80%]
+
NOTE: For an explanation of this step, refer to annotation *4* of the Declarative Pipeline in the link:../build-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm/#create-your-initial-pipeline-as-a-jenkinsfile["Create your initial Pipeline..."] section of the build a Node.js and React app tutorial.

. ( _Optional_ ) Select the back arrow icon image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-16a-return-from-step-icon.png[alt="Return from step icon",width=3%] in the upper left to return to the main Pipeline editor.
. Select *Save* in the upper right side of the screen to begin saving your new Pipeline with its "Build" stage.
. In the *Save Pipeline* dialog box, enter the commit message in the *Description* field, for example `Add initial Pipeline (Jenkinsfile)`.
+
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-18-save-pipeline-dialog-box.png[alt="Save Pipeline dialog box",width=70%]
. Leave all other options set to their default, and then select *Save & run*.
Jenkins proceeds to build your Pipeline.
. When the main Blue Ocean interface appears, select the row to see Jenkins build your Pipeline project.
You'll need to wait for this first run to complete before proceeding.
During this time, Jenkins does the following:
.. Commits your Pipeline as a `Jenkinsfile` to the only branch of your repository.
.. Initially queues the project to be built on the agent.
.. Downloads the Node Docker image and runs it in a container on Docker.
.. Executes the `Build` stage defined in the `Jenkinsfile` on the Node container.
+
NOTE: During this time, `npm` downloads the dependencies necessary to run your Node.js and React application, which will be stored in the local `node_modules` directory in the Jenkins home directory.
+
[.boxshadow]

[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-19b-main-blue-ocean-interface.png[alt="Main Blue Ocean interface",width=100%]

WARNING: Before continuing on, verify that Jenkins has created a `Jenkinsfile` for you at the root of your forked GitHub repository, in the repository's sole `master` branch.


=== Add a test stage to your Pipeline

. From the main Blue Ocean interface, select *Branches* in the upper right to access your repository's branches page, where you can access the `master` branch.
+
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-21-repository-branches-page.png[alt="Repository branches page",width=100%]
. Select the `master` branch's "Edit Pipeline" icon image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-21a-edit-pipeline-on-branch.png[alt="Edit Pipeline on branch",width=3%] to open the Pipeline editor for this branch.
. In the main Pipeline editor, select the *+* icon to the right of the *Build* stage you created <<create-your-initial-pipeline,above>> to open the new stage panel on the right.
+
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-22-add-test-stage.png[alt="Add 'Test' stage",width=45%]
. In this panel, enter `Test` in the *Name your stage* field, and then select the *Add Step* button below to open the *Choose step type* panel.
. In this panel, select *Shell Script* near the top of the list.
. In the resulting *Test / Shell Script* panel, specify `./jenkins/scripts/test.sh` and then select the back arrow icon image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-16a-return-from-step-icon.png[alt="Return from step icon",width=3%] in the upper left to return to the Pipeline stage editor.
. At the lower right of the panel, select *Settings* to reveal this section of the panel.
. Select the *+* icon at the right of the *Environment* heading where you'll configure an environment directive.
. In the *Name* and *Value* fields that appear, specify `CI` and `true`, respectively.
+
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-23-environment-directive.png[alt="Environment directive",width=50%]
+
NOTE: For an explanation of this directive and its step, refer to annotations *1* and *3* of the Declarative Pipeline in the link:../build-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm/#add-a-test-stage-to-your-pipeline["Add a test stage..." section of the Build a Node.js and React app] tutorial.
. ( _Optional_ ) Select the back arrow icon image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-16a-return-from-step-icon.png[alt="Return from step icon",width=3%] in the upper left to return to the main Pipeline editor.

. In the *Save Pipeline* dialog box, specify the commit message in the *Description* field, for example `Add 'Test' stage`.
. Leave all other options set to their default, and then select *Save & run*.
Jenkins proceeds to build your amended Pipeline.
. When the main Blue Ocean interface appears, select the _top_ row to see Jenkins build your Pipeline project.

* If your amended Pipeline ran successfully, here's what the Blue Ocean interface should look like, notice the additional "Test" stage.
You can select the previous "Build" stage circle to access the output from that stage.
[.boxshadow]
image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-24-test-stage-runs-successfully-with-output.png[alt="Test stage runs successfully (with output)",width=100%]
+
TIP: You'll notice during this run that Jenkins no longer needs to download the Node Docker image.
Instead, Jenkins only needs to run a new container from the Node image downloaded previously.
Subsequent runs of your Pipeline should be much faster.

. Select the *X* at the top-right corner to return to the main Blue Ocean interface.


=== Add a final deliver stage to your Pipeline

. From the main Blue Ocean interface, select *Branches* in the upper right to access your repository's `master` branch.

image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-38-main-blue-ocean-interface-with-all-previous-runs-displayed.png[alt="Main Blue Ocean interface with all previous runs displayed",width=100%]

=== Follow up (optional)

If you check the contents of the `Jenkinsfile` that Blue Ocean created at the root of your forked `creating-a-pipeline-in-blue-ocean` repository, note the location of the link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax#environment[`environment`] directive.
This directive's location within the "Test" stage means that the environment variable `CI`, with its value of `true`, is only available within the scope of this "Test" stage.

You can set this directive in Blue Ocean, so that its environment variable is available globally throughout Pipeline.
This is also configured in the link:../build-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm/[build a Node.js and React app with npm] tutorial.

To do this:

. From the main Blue Ocean interface, select *Branches* in the upper right to access your repository's `master` branch.
. Select the `master` branch's "Edit Pipeline" icon image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-21a-edit-pipeline-on-branch.png[alt="Edit Pipeline on branch",width=3%] to open the Pipeline editor for this branch.
. In the main Pipeline editor, select the *Test* stage you created <<add-a-test-stage-to-your-pipeline,above>> to begin editing it.
. In the stage panel, select *Settings* to reveal this section of the panel.
. Select the minus (*-*) icon associated with the `CI` environment directive you created earlier to delete it.
. Select the back arrow icon image:tutorials/pipeline-in-blueocean-16a-return-from-step-icon.png[alt="Return from step icon",width=3%] to return to the main Pipeline editor.
. In the *Pipeline Settings* panel, select the *+* icon to the right side of the *Environment* heading.
Here, you'll configure a _global_ environment directive.
. In the *Name* and *Value* fields, specify `CI` and `true`, respectively.
. Select the *Save* button to begin saving your Pipeline with with its relocated environment directive.
. In the *Save Pipeline* dialog box, enter the commit message in the *Description* field, for example `Make environment directive global`.
. Leave all other options set to their default, and then select *Save & run*.
Jenkins proceeds to build your amended Pipeline.
. When the main Blue Ocean interface appears, select the _top_ row to see Jenkins build your Pipeline project.
This starts the same build process as when you completed adding the final deliver stage <<add-a-final-deliver-stage-to-your-pipeline,above>>.
However, when you inspect the `Jenkinsfile` again, you'll notice that the `environment` directive is now a sibling of the `agent` section.

== Wrapping up

Well done! You've used the Blue Ocean feature of Jenkins to build a simple Node.js and React application with npm.

The "Build," "Test," and "Deliver" stages you created are the basis for building other applications in Jenkins with any technology stack, including more complex applications and ones that combine multiple technology stacks.

Because Jenkins is extremely extensible, it can be modified and configured to handle almost any aspect of build orchestration and automation.

To learn more about what Jenkins can do, check out:

* The link:/doc/tutorials[Tutorials overview] page for other introductory tutorials.
* The link:/doc/book[User Handbook] for more detailed information about using Jenkins, such as link:/doc/book/pipeline[Pipelines], link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax[Pipeline syntax], and the link:/doc/book/blueocean[Blue Ocean] interface.
* The link:/node[Jenkins blog] for the latest events, other tutorials, and updates.
