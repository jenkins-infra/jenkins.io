title: Using Jenkins to build a Java/Maven project
section: doc
---

:toc:
:imagesdir: /doc/book/resources

This tutorial shows you how to build a simple Java application using Maven,
whose overall build process will be orchestrated in Jenkins.

If you are a Java/Maven developer who is new to CI/CD concepts, or you might be
familiar with these concepts but don't know how to implement building your
project using Jenkins, then this tutorial is for you.

The simple Java application (which you’ll obtain from a sample repository on
GitHub) outputs the string "Hello world!" and is accompanied by a unit test to
check that the main application works as expected.

*Duration:* This tutorial takes 20-40 minutes to complete (assuming you've
already met the <<prerequisites,prerequisites>> below). The exact duration will
depend on the speed of your machine and whether or not you've already
<<download-and-run-jenkins-in-docker,downloaded and run Jenkins in Docker>> from
link:..[another introductory tutorial].

You can stop this tutorial at any point in time and continue from where you left
off.

=== Fork and clone the sample repository on GitHub

Obtain the simple "Hello world!" Java application from GitHub, by forking the
sample repository of the application's source code into your own GitHub account
and then cloning this fork locally.

. Ensure you are signed in to your GitHub account. If you don't yet have a GitHub account,
  sign up for a free one on the https://github.com/[GitHub website].
. Fork the
  https://github.com/gilesgas/simple-java-maven-app[`simple-java-maven-app`] on
  GitHub into your local GitHub account. If you need help with this process,
  refer to the https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/[Fork A Repo]
  documentation on the GitHub website for more information.
. Begin cloning your forked `simple-java-maven-app` repository (on GitHub)
  locally to your machine by opening up a terminal/command line window to the
  directory in which the repository will be cloned. In this tutorial, we'll
  assume that `simple-java-maven-app` will be cloned within the following
  directories on these platforms, which you should `cd` into now:
* macOS - `/Users/<your-username>/Documents/GitHub`
* Linux - `/home/<your-username>/GitHub`
* Windows - `C:\Users\<your-username>\Documents\GitHub`

+
where `<your-username>` is your user account's name on your operating system.

+
*Note:*

** On a Windows machine, use a Git bash command line window (as opposed to the
   usual Microsoft command prompt).
** Alternatively, and in particular if you have the GitHub Desktop app installed
   on your machine, in GitHub, you can click the green *Clone or download*
   button on your forked repository and follow the instructions to clone the
   repository locally. If you use GitHub Desktop, you can omit the following
   step.

+
. Run the following command to continue/complete cloning your forked repo: +
  `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-ACCOUNT-NAME/simple-java-maven-app` +
  where `YOUR-GITHUB-ACCOUNT-NAME` is the name of your GitHub account.


=== Create your Pipeline project in Jenkins

. Go back to Jenkins, log in again if necessary and click *create new jobs*
  under *Welcome to Jenkins!*
. In the *Enter an item name* field, specify the name for your new Pipeline
  project. In this tutorial, we'll assume `simple-java-maven-app`.
. Scroll down and click *Pipeline*, then click *OK* at the end of the page.
. ( _Optional_ ) On the next page, specify a brief description for your Pipeline
  in the *Description* field (e.g. `An entry-level Pipeline demonstrating how to
  build a simple Java Maven project using Jenkins.`)
. Click the *Pipeline* tab at the top of the page to scroll down to the
  *Pipeline* section.
. From the *Definition* field, choose the *Pipeline script from SCM* option.
  This option instructs Jenkins to obtain your Pipeline from Source Control
  Management (SCM), which will be your locally cloned Git repository.
. From the *SCM* field, choose *Git*.
. In the *Repository URL* field, specify the directory path of your locally
  cloned repository <<fork-and-clone-the-sample-repository-on-github,above>>,
  which is from your user account/home directory on your host machine, mapped to
  the `/home` directory of the Jenkins/Blue Ocean container - i.e.
* For macOS - `/home/Documents/GitHub/simple-java-maven-app`
* For Linux - `/home/GitHub/simple-java-maven-app`
* For Windows - `/home/Documents/GitHub/simple-java-maven-app`
. Click *Save* to save your new Pipeline project. You're now ready to begin
  creating your `Jenkinsfile`, which you'll be checking into your locally cloned
  Git repository.


=== Create your initial Pipeline as a Jenkinsfile

You're now ready to create your Pipeline that will automate building your
Java/Maven project in Jenkins. Your Pipeline will be created as a `Jenkinsfile`,
which will be committed to your locally cloned Git repository
(`simple-java-maven-app`).

This is the foundation of "Pipeline-as-Code", which treats the continuous
delivery pipeline a part of the application to be versioned and reviewed like
any other code. Read more about Pipeline and what a Jenkinsfile is in the
link:/doc/book/pipeline[Pipeline] and link:/doc/book/pipeline/jenkinsfile[Using
a Jenkinsfile] sections of the User Handbook.

First, we'll create an initial Pipeline to download a Maven Docker image and run
it as a Docker container (which will build your simple Java application). We'll
also add a build stage to the Pipeline that begins orchestrating this whole
process.

. Using your favorite text editor or IDE, create and save new text file with the
  name `Jenkinsfile` at the root of your local `simple-java-maven-app` Git
  repository.
. Copy the following Declarative Pipeline code and paste it into your empty
  `Jenkinsfile`:
+
[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker {
            image 'maven:3-alpine' // <1>
            args '-v /root/.m2:/root/.m2' // <2>
        }
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') { // <3>
            steps {
                sh 'mvn -B -DskipTests clean package' // <4>
            }
        }
    }
}
----
<1> This `image` parameter (of the link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax#agent[`agent`]
section's `docker` parameter) downloads the
https://hub.docker.com/_/maven/[`maven:3-apline` Docker image] (if it's not
already available in your Docker host) and runs this image as a separate
container. This means that:
* You'll have separate Jenkins/Blue Ocean and Maven containers running locally
  in Docker.
* The Maven container becomes the link:/doc/book/glossary/#agent[agent] that
  Jenkins uses to build your Pipeline project. However, this container is
  short-lived - its lifespan is only that of the duration of your Pipeline's
  execution.
<2> This `args` parameter creates a reciprocal mapping between the `/root/.m2`
(i.e. Maven repository) directories in the short-lived Maven Docker container
and that of your Docker host's filesystem. Explaining the details behind this is
beyond the scope of this tutorial. However, the main reason for doing this is to
ensure that the artifacts necessary to build your Java application (which Maven
downloads while your Pipeline is being executed) are retained in the Maven
repository beyond the lifespan of the Maven container. This prevents Maven from
having to download the same artifacts during successive runs of your Jenkins
Pipeline, which you'll be conducting later on. Be aware that unlike the Docker
data volume you created for `jenkins-data`
<<download-and-run-jenkins-in-docker,above>>, the Docker host's filesystem is
effectively cleared out each time Docker is restarted. This means you'll lose
the downloaded Maven repository artifacts each time Docker restarts.
<3> Defines a stage called `Build` that appears on the Jenkins UI.
<4> This `sh` step (of the link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#steps[`steps`]
section) runs the Maven command to cleanly build your Java application (without
running any tests).
+
. Save your amended `Jenkinsfile` and commit it to your local
  `simple-java-maven-app` Git repository. E.g. Within the
  `simple-java-maven-app` directory, run the commands: +
  `git add .` +
  then +
  `git commit -m "Add initial Jenkinsfile"`
. Go back to Jenkins again, log in again if necessary and click *Open Blue
  Ocean* on the left to access Jenkins's Blue Ocean interface.
. In the *This job has not been run* message box, click *Run*, then quickly
  click the *OPEN* link which appears briefly at the lower-right to see Jenkins
  building your Pipeline project. If you weren't able to click the *OPEN* link,
  click the row on the main Blue Ocean interface to access this feature.

+
*Note:* You may need to wait several minutes for this first run to complete.
After making a clone of your local `simple-java-maven-app` Git repository
itself, Jenkins:

.. Initially queues the project to be built on the agent.
.. Downloads the Maven Docker image and runs it in a container on Docker. +
   image:tutorials/java-maven-01-downloading-maven-docker-image.png[alt="Downloading
   Maven Docker image",width=100%]
.. Executes the `Build` stage (defined in the `Jenkinsfile`) on the Maven
   container. During this time, Maven will download many artifacts necessary to
   build your Java application, which will ultimately be stored in Jenkins's
   local Maven repository (in the Docker host's filesystem). +

The Blue Ocean interface turns green if Jenkins built your Java application
successfully. +

=== Add a test stage to your Pipeline

. Go back to your text editor/IDE and ensure your `Jenkinsfile` is open.
. Copy and paste the following Declarative Pipeline syntax immediately under the
  `Build` stage of your `Jenkinsfile`:
+
[source,groovy]
----
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
----
+
so that you end up with:
+
[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker {
            image 'maven:3-alpine'
            args '-v /root/.m2:/root/.m2'
        }
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn -B -DskipTests clean package'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') { // <1>
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test' // <2>
            }
        }
    }
}
----
+
<1> Defines a new stage called `Test` that appears on the Jenkins UI.
<2> This `sh` step (of the link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#steps[`steps`]
section) runs the Maven command to run a unit test on your simple Java
application.
+
. Save your amended `Jenkinsfile` and commit it to your local
  `simple-java-maven-app` Git repository. E.g. Within the
  `simple-java-maven-app` directory, run the commands: +
  `git stage .` +
  then +
  `git commit -m "Add 'Test' stage"`
. Go back to Jenkins again, log in again if necessary and ensure you've accessed
  Jenkins's Blue Ocean interface.
. Click *Run* at the top left, then quickly click the *OPEN* link which appears
  briefly at the lower-right to see Jenkins building your amended Pipeline
  project. If you weren't able to click the **OPEN** link, click the _top_ row
  on the Blue Ocean interface to access this feature.

+
*Note:* You'll notice from this run that Jenkins no longer needs to download the
Maven Docker image. Instead, Jenkins only needs to spin up a new container from
the image downloaded previously. Also, if Docker had not restarted since you
last ran the Pipeline <<create-your-initial-pipeline-as-a-jenkinsfile,above>>,
no Maven artifacts need to be downloaded. Therefore, running your Pipeline this
subsequent time should be much faster. +
If your amended Pipeline ran successfully, here's what the Blue Ocean interface
should look like. Notice the additional "Test" stage. You can click on the
previous "Build" stage circle to access the output from that stage. +

stage runs successfully (with output)",width=100%]

+
. Click the *X* at the top-right to return to the main Blue Ocean interface.


=== Add a final deliver stage to your Pipeline

. Go back to your text editor/IDE and ensure your `Jenkinsfile` is open.
. Copy and paste the following Declarative Pipeline syntax immediately under the
  `Test` stage of your `Jenkinsfile`:
+
[source,groovy]
----
        stage('Deliver') {
            steps {
                sh './jenkins/scripts/deliver.sh'
            }
        }
----
+
so that you end up with:
+
[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
    agent {
        docker {
            image 'maven:3-alpine'
            args '-v /root/.m2:/root/.m2'
        }
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn -B -DskipTests clean package'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Deliver') { // <1>
            steps {
                sh './jenkins/scripts/deliver.sh' // <2>
            }
        }
    }
}
----
+
<1> Defines a new stage called `Deliver` that appears on the Jenkins UI.
<2> This `sh` step (of the link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#steps[`steps`]
section) runs the shell script `deliver.sh` located in the `jenkins/scripts`
directory from the root of the `simple-java-maven-app` repository. As a general
principle, it's a good idea to keep your Pipeline code (i.e. the `Jenkinsfile`)
as tidy as possible and place more complex build scripting steps into separate
shell script files like the `deliver.sh` file. This ultimately makes maintaining
your Pipeline code easier, especially if your Pipeline gains more complexity.

+
. Save your amended `Jenkinsfile` and commit it to your local
  `simple-java-maven-app` Git repository. E.g. Within the
  `simple-java-maven-app` directory, run the commands: +
  `git stage .` +
  then +
  `git commit -m "Add 'Deliver' stage"`
. Go back to Jenkins again, log in again if necessary and ensure you've accessed
  Jenkins's Blue Ocean interface.
. Click *Run* at the top left, then quickly click the *OPEN* link which appears
  briefly at the lower-right to see Jenkins building your amended Pipeline
  project. If you weren't able to click the **OPEN** link, click the _top_ row
  on the Blue Ocean interface to access this feature. +
  If your amended Pipeline ran successfully, here's what the Blue Ocean
  interface should look like. Notice the additional "Deliver" stage. Click on
  the previous "Test" and "Build" stage circles to access the outputs from those
  stages. +
  image:tutorials/java-maven-23-deliver-stage-runs-successfully.png[alt="Deliver
  stage runs successfully",width=100%] +
  Here's what the output of the "Deliver" stage should look like, showing you
  the execution results of your Java application. +
  image:tutorials/java-maven-25-deliver-stage-output-only.png[alt="Deliver
  stage output only",width=100%]
. Click the *X* at the top-right to return to the main Blue Ocean interface,
  which lists your previous Pipeline runs in reverse chronological order. +

  Blue Ocean interface with all previous runs displayed",width=100%]

////
Hide this warning due to temporary addition to 'mvn jar:jar install:install'
fix implemented.
*Warning:* It's possible that since Maven downloads artifacts during this final
`Deliver` stage, Maven will attempt to run some of the other commands further
down the `sh` step before the artifacts have finished downloading. This will
cause the build to fail. If you notice the build failing the first time, run
the Pipeline project again and it should succeed.
