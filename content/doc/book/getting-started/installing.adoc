= Installing Jenkins

[NOTE]
====
This is still very much a work in progress
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
This section is part of _Getting Started_.
It provides instructions for *basic* Jenkins configuration on a number of platforms.
It *DOES NOT* cover the full range of considerations or options for installing Jenkins.
See link:/doc/book/appendix/advanced-installation/[Advanced Jenkins Installation]
====

== Overview


== Pre-install

=== System Requirements

[WARNING]
====
These are *starting points*.
For a full discussion of factors see link:/doc/book/hardware-recommendations/[Discussion of hardware recommendations].
====

Minimum Recommended Configuration:

* Java 8 (either JRE or JDK)
* 256MB free memory
* 1GB+ free disk space

Recommended Configuration for Small Team:

* Java 8
* 1GB+ free memory
* 50GB+ free disk space


=== Experimentation, Staging, or Production?

How you configure Jenkins will differ significantly depending on your intended use cases.
This section is specifically targeted to initial use and experimentation.
For other scenarios, see link:/doc/book/appendix/advanced-installation/[Advanced Jenkins Installation].

=== Stand-alone or Servlet?

Jenkins can run stand-alone in its own process using its own built-in web server (Jetty).
It can also run as one servlet in an existing framework, such as Tomcat or Glassfish application servers.
This section is specifically targeted to stand-alone install and execution.
For other scenarios, see link:/doc/book/appendix/advanced-installation/[Advanced Jenkins Installation]

== Installation

[WARNING]
====
These are *clean install* instructions for *non-production* environments.
If you have a *non-production* Jenkins server already running on a system and want to upgrade, see link:/doc/book/getting-started/upgrading/[Upgrading Jenkins].
If you are installing or upgrading a production Jenkins server, see link:/doc/book/appendix/advanced-installation/[Advanced Jenkins Installation].
====

=== Unix/Linux

==== Debian/Ubuntu
On Debian-based distributions, such as Ubuntu, you can install Jenkins through `apt`.

Recent versions are available in link:https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/[an apt repository]. Older but stable LTS versions are in link:https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/[this apt repository].

[source,bash]
----
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins
----

This package installation will:

* Setup Jenkins as a daemon launched on start. See `/etc/init.d/jenkins` for more details.
* Create a '`jenkins`' user to run this service.
* Direct console log output to the file `/var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log`. Check this file if you are troubleshooting Jenkins.
* Populate `/etc/default/jenkins` with configuration parameters for the launch, e.g `JENKINS_HOME`
* Set Jenkins to listen on port 8080. Access this port with your browser to start configuration.

[NOTE]
====
If your `/etc/init.d/jenkins` file fails to start Jenkins, edit the `/etc/default/jenkins` to replace the line
`----HTTP_PORT=8080----` with `----HTTP_PORT=8081----`
Here, "8081" was chosen but you can put another port available.
====

==== OpenIndiana Hipster

On a system running link:http://www.openindiana.org/[OpenIndiana Hipster]
Jenkins can be installed in either the local or global zone using the
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_Packaging_System[Image Packaging
System] (IPS).

[NOTE]
====
Disclaimer: This platform is NOT officially supported by the Jenkins team,
use it at your own risk. Packaging and integration described in this section
is maintained by the OpenIndiana Hipster team, bundling the generic `jenkins.war`
to work in that operating environment.
====

For the common case of running the newest packaged weekly build as a standalone (Jetty) server, simply execute:

[source,bash]
----
pkg install jenkins
svcadm enable jenkins
----

The common packaging integration for a standalone service will:

* Create a `jenkins` user to run the service and to own the directory structures under `/var/lib/jenkins`.
* Pull the OpenJDK8 and other packages required to execute Jenkins, including
  the `jenkins-core-weekly` package with the latest `jenkins.war`.
+
CAUTION: Long-Term Support (LTS) Jenkins releases currently do not support OpenZFS-based
systems, so no packaging is provided at this time.
* Set up Jenkins as an SMF service instance (`svc:/network/http:jenkins`) which
 Â can then be enabled with the `svcadm` command demonstrated above.
* Set up Jenkins to listen on port 8080.
* Configure the log output to be managed by SMF at `/var/svc/log/network-http:jenkins.log`.

Once Jenkins is running, consult the log
(`/var/svc/log/network-http:jenkins.log`) to retrieve the generated
administrator password for the initial set up of Jenkins, usually it will be 
found at `/var/lib/jenkins/home/secrets/initialAdminPassword`. Then navigate to
link:http://localhost:8080[localhost:8080] to <<setupwizard, complete configuration of the
Jenkins instance>>.


To change attributes of the service, such as environment variables like `JENKINS_HOME`
or the port number used for the Jetty web server, use the `svccfg` utility:

[source,bash]
----
svccfg -s svc:/network/http:jenkins editprop
svcadm refresh svc:/network/http:jenkins
----

You can also refer to `/lib/svc/manifest/network/jenkins-standalone.xml` for more
details and comments about currently supported tunables of the SMF service.
Note that the `jenkins` user account created by the packaging is specially privileged
to allow binding to port numbers under 1024.

The current status of Jenkins-related packages available for the given release
of OpenIndiana can be queried with:

[source,bash]
----
pkg info -r '*jenkins*'
----

Upgrades to the package can be performed by updating the entire operating
environment with `pkg update`, or specifically for Jenkins core software with:

[source,bash]
----
pkg update jenkins-core-weekly
----

[CAUTION]
====
Procedure for updating the package will restart the currently running Jenkins
process. Make sure to prepare it for shutdown and finish all running jobs
before updating, if needed.
====



==== Solaris, OmniOS, SmartOS, and other siblings

Generally it should suffice to install Java 8 and link:/download[download] the
`jenkins.war` and run it as a standalone process or under an application server
such as link:http://tomcat.apache.org[Apache Tomcat].


Some caveats apply:

* Headless JVM and fonts: For OpenJDK builds on minimalized-footprint systems,
  there may be
  link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+got+java.awt.headless+problem[issues
  running the headless JVM], because Jenkins needs some fonts to render certain
  pages.
* ZFS-related JVM crashes: When Jenkins runs on a system detected as a `SunOS`,
  it tries to load integration for advanced ZFS features using the bundled
  `libzfs.jar` which maps calls from Java to native `libzfs.so` routines
  provided by the host OS. Unfortunately, that library was made for binary
  utilities built and bundled by the OS along with it at the same time, and was
  never intended as a stable interface exposed to consumers. As the forks of
  Solaris legacy, including ZFS and later the OpenZFS initiative evolved, many
  different binary function signatures were provided by different host
  operating systems - and when Jenkins `libzfs.jar` invoked the wrong
  signature, the whole JVM process crashed. A solution was proposed and
  integrated in `jenkins.war` since weekly release 2.55 (and not yet in any LTS
  to date) which enables the administrator to configure which function
  signatures should be used for each function known to have different variants,
  apply it to their application server initialization options and then run and
  update the generic `jenkins.war` without further workarounds. See
  link:https://github.com/kohsuke/libzfs4j[the libzfs4j Git repository] for
  more details, including a script to try and "lock-pick" the configuration
  needed for your particular distribution (in particular if your kernel updates
  bring a new incompatible `libzfs.so`).

Also note that forks of the OpenZFS initiative may provide ZFS on various
BSD, Linux, and macOS distributions. Once Jenkins supports detecting ZFS
capabilities, rather than relying on the `SunOS` check, the above caveats for
ZFS integration with Jenkins should be considered.


=== macOS

To install from the website, using a package:

* link:http://mirrors.jenkins.io/osx/latest[Download the latest package]
* Open the package and follow the instructions

Jenkins can also be installed using `brew`:

* Install the latest release version
[source,bash]
----
brew install jenkins
----

* Install the LTS version
[source,bash]
----
brew install jenkins-lts
----


=== Windows

To install from the website, using the installer:

* link:http://mirrors.jenkins.io/windows/latest[Download the latest package]
* Open the package and follow the instructions


=== Docker
You must have link:http://docker.io[Docker] properly installed on your machine.
See the link:https://www.docker.io/gettingstarted/#h_installation[Docker installation guide] for details.


First, pull the official link:https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jenkins[jenkins] image from Docker repository.

[source,bash]
----
docker pull jenkins/jenkins
----

Next, run a container using this image and map data directory from the container to the host; e.g in the example below `/var/jenkins_home` from the container is mapped to `jenkins/` directory from the current path on the host. Jenkins `8080` port is also exposed to the host as `49001`.

[source,bash]
----
docker run -d -p 49001:8080 -v $PWD/jenkins:/var/jenkins_home -t jenkins/jenkins
----

=== Other
See link:/doc/book/appendix/advanced-installation/[Advanced Jenkins Installation]


[[setupwizard]]
== Post-install (Setup Wizard)

=== Create Admin User and Password for Jenkins

Jenkins is initially configured to be secure on first launch.
Jenkins can no longer be accessed without a username and
password and open ports are limited. During the initial run of
Jenkins a security token is generated and printed in the console
log:

----
*************************************************************

Jenkins initial setup is required. A security token is required to proceed.
Please use the following security token to proceed to installation:

41d2b60b0e4cb5bf2025d33b21cb

*************************************************************
----

The install instructions for each of the platforms above includes the default location for when you can find this log output.
This token must be entered in the "Setup Wizard" the first time you open the Jenkins UI.
This token will also serve as the default password for the user 'admin' if you skip the user-creation step in the Setup Wizard.

=== Initial Plugin Installation

The Setup Wizard will also install the initial plugins for this Jenkins server.
The recommended set of plugins available are based on the most common use cases.
You are free to add more during the Setup Wizard or install them later as needed.
