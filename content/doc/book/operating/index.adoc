= Operating Jenkins

This chapter for system administrators of Jenkins servers and nodes. It will
cover system maintenance topics including security, monitoring, and backup/restore.

Users not involved with system-level tasks will find this chapter of limited use.
Individual sections may assume knowledge of information
from previous sections, but such assumptions will be explicitly called out and cross-referenced.

If you are not yet familiar with basic Jenkins terminology and features, start with
<<getting-started#,Getting Started with Jenkins>>.

If you are already familiar with Jenkins basics and would like to delve deeper into how to use specific features, see
<<using#,Using Jenkins>>.

If you are a Jenkins administrator and want to know more about managing Jenkins nodes and instances, see
<<managing#,Managing Jenkins>>.
