= Pipeline Development Tools

Jenkins Pipeline includes
<<getting-started#built-in-documentation, built-in documentation>> and the
<<getting-started#snippet-generator, Snippet Generator>> which are key resources
when developing Pipelines. They provide detailed help and information that is customized
to the currently installed version of Jenkins and related plugins.
In this section, we'll discuss other tools and resources
that may help with development of Jenkins Pipelines.


== Blue Ocean Editor

The
<<../blueocean/pipeline-editor#, Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor>> provides a
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG[WYSIWYG]
way to create Declarative Pipelines. The editor offers a structural view of all the stages,
parallel branches, and steps in a Pipeline. The editor validates Pipeline changes as they are
made, eliminating many errors before they are even committed.  Behind the scenes
it still generates Declarative Pipeline code.

[[linter]]
== Command-line Pipeline Linter

Jenkins can validate, or
"link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)[lint]",
a Declarative Pipeline from the command line before actually running it.
This can be done using a Jenkins CLI command or by making an
HTTP POST
request with appropriate parameters.
We recommended using the
<<../managing/cli#ssh, SSH interface>>
to run the linter. See the <<../managing/cli, Jenkins CLI documentation>> for details on how to properly configure
Jenkins for secure command-line access.

.Linting via the CLI with SSH
[source,bash]
----
# ssh (Jenkins CLI)
# JENKINS_SSHD_PORT=[sshd port on master]
# JENKINS_HOSTNAME=[Jenkins master hostname]
ssh -p $JENKINS_SSHD_PORT $JENKINS_HOSTNAME declarative-linter < Jenkinsfile
----

.Linting via HTTP POST using `curl`
[source,bash]
----
# curl (REST API)
# Assuming "anonymous read access" has been enabled on your Jenkins instance.
# JENKINS_URL=[root URL of Jenkins master]
# JENKINS_CRUMB is needed if your Jenkins master has CRSF protection enabled as it should
JENKINS_CRUMB=`curl "$JENKINS_URL/crumbIssuer/api/xml?xpath=concat(//crumbRequestField,\":\",//crumb)"`
curl -X POST -H $JENKINS_CRUMB -F "jenkinsfile=<Jenkinsfile" $JENKINS_URL/pipeline-model-converter/validate
----

=== Examples

Below are two examples of the Pipeline Linter in action.
This first example shows the output of the linter when it is passed
an invalid `Jenkinsfile`, one that is missing part of the `agent` declaration.

.Jenkinsfile
[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
  agent
  stages {
    stage ('Initialize') {
      steps {
        echo 'Placeholder.'
      }
    }
  }
}
----

.Linter output for invalid Jenkinsfile
[source,bash]
----
# pass a Jenkinsfile that does not contain an "agent" section
ssh -p 8675 localhost declarative-linter < ./Jenkinsfile
Errors encountered validating Jenkinsfile:
WorkflowScript: 2: Not a valid section definition: "agent". Some extra configuration is required. @ line 2, column 3.
     agent
     ^

WorkflowScript: 1: Missing required section "agent" @ line 1, column 1.
   pipeline &#125;
   ^
----

In this second example, the `Jenkinsfile` has been updated to include the
missing `any` on `agent`.  The linter now reports that the Pipeline is valid.

.Jenkinsfile
[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage ('Initialize') {
      steps {
        echo 'Placeholder.'
      }
    }
  }
}
----

.Linter output for valid Jenkinsfile
[source,bash]
----
ssh -p 8675 localhost declarative-linter < ./Jenkinsfile
Jenkinsfile successfully validated.
----

[[replay]]
== "Replay" Pipeline Runs with Modifications

Typically a Pipeline will be defined inside of the classic Jenkins web UI,
or by committing to a `Jenkinsfile` in source control. Unfortunately,
neither approach is ideal for rapid iteration, or prototyping, of a Pipeline.
The "Replay" feature allows for quick modifications and execution of an existing
Pipeline without changing the Pipeline configuration or creating a new commit.

=== Usage

To use the "Replay" feature:

. Select a previously completed run in the build history.
+
image::pipeline/replay-previous-run.png[Previous Pipeline Run]
+
. Click "Replay" in the left menu
+
image::pipeline/replay-left-bar.png[Replay Left-menu Button]
+
. Make modifications and click "Run". In this example, we changed "ruby-2.3" to "ruby-2.4".
+
image::pipeline/replay-modified.png[Replay Left-menu Button]
+
. Check the results of changes

Once you are satisfied with the changes,
you can use Replay to view them again, copy them back to your Pipeline job
or `Jenkinsfile`, and then commit them using your usual engineering processes.

=== Features

* *Can be called multiple times on the same run* -
allows for easy parallel testing of different changes.
* *Can also be called on Pipeline runs that are still in-progress* -
As long as a Pipeline contained syntactically correct Groovy and was able to start,
it can be Replayed.
* *Referenced Shared Library code is also modifiable* - If a Pipeline run references a
<<shared-libraries, Shared Library>>, the code from the shared library will
also be shown and modifiable as part of the Replay page.

=== Limitations

* *Pipeline runs with syntax errors cannot be replayed* -
meaning their code cannot be viewed and any changes made in them cannot be retrieved.
When using Replay for more significant modifications, save your changes
to a file or editor outside of Jenkins before running them.
See link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-37589[JENKINS-37589]
* *Replayed Pipeline behavior may differ from runs started by other methods* -
For Pipelines that are not part of a Multi-branch Pipeline,
the commit information may differ for the original run and the Replayed run.
See link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-36453[JENKINS-36453]


[[unit-test]]
== Pipeline Unit Testing Framework

NOTE: The Pipeline Unit Testing Framework is a third-party tool that is not supported
by the Jenkins Project.

The link:https://github.com/lesfurets/JenkinsPipelineUnit[Pipeline Unit Testing Framework]
allows you to
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing[unit test]
Pipelines and <<shared-libraries, Shared Libraries>>
before running them in full. It provides a mock execution environment where real
Pipeline steps are replaced with mock objects that you can use to check for expected
behavior. New and rough around the edges, but promising.
The link:https://github.com/lesfurets/JenkinsPipelineUnit/blob/master/README.md[README]
for that project contains examples and usage instructions.
