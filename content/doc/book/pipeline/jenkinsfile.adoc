= The Jenkinsfile

This section builds on the information covered in <<getting-started#, Getting Started>>,
and introduces more useful steps, common patterns, and demonstrates some
non-trivial `Jenkinsfile` examples.

Creating a `Jenkinsfile`, which is checked into source control
footnoteref:[scm, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_control_management],
provides a number of immediate benefits:

* Code review/iteration on the Pipeline
* Audit trail for the Pipeline
* Single source of truth
  footnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Source_of_Truth]
  for the Pipeline, which can be viewed and edited by multiple members of the project.


While the syntax for defining a Pipeline, either in the web UI or with a
`Jenkinsfile`, is the same, it's generally considered best practice to define
the Pipeline in a `Jenkinsfile` and check that in to source control.


== Creating a Jenkinsfile

As discussed in the <<getting-started#defining-a-pipeline-in-scm, Getting Started>>
section, a `Jenkinsfile` is a text file that contains the definition of a
Jenkins Pipeline and is checked into source control. Consider the following
Pipeline which implements a basic three-stage continuous delivery pipeline.

[pipeline]
----
// Script //
node { // <1>
    stage('Build') { // <2>
        /* .. snip .. */
    }
    stage('Test') {
        /* .. snip .. */
    }
    stage('Deploy') {
        /* .. snip .. */
    }
}
// Declarative not yet implemented //
----
<1> `node` allocates an executor and workspace in the Jenkins environment.
<2> `stage` describes distinct parts of the Pipeline for better visualization of progress/status.

Not all Pipelines will have these same three stages, but this is a good
continuous delivery starting point to define them for most projects. The
sections below will demonstrate the creation and execution of a simple Pipeline
in a test installation of Jenkins.

[NOTE]
====
It is assumed that there is already a source control repository set up for
the project and a Pipeline has been defined in Jenkins following
<<getting-started#defining-a-pipeline-in-scm, these instructions>>.
====

Using a text editor, ideally one which supports
link:http://groovy-lang.org[Groovy]
syntax highlighting, create a new `Jenkinsfile` in the root directory of the
project.


In the example above, `node` is a crucial first step as it allocates an
executor and workspace for the Pipeline. In essence, without `node`, a Pipeline
cannot do any work! From within `node`, the first order of business will be to
checkout the source code for this project.  Since the `Jenkinsfile` is being
pulled directly from source control, Pipeline provides a quick and easy way to
access the right revision of the source code

[pipeline]
----
// Script //
node {
    checkout scm // <1>
    /* .. snip .. */
}
// Declarative not yet implemented //
----
<1> The `checkout` step will checkout code from source control; `scm` is a
special variable which instructs the `checkout` step to clone the specific
revision which triggered this Pipeline run.

=== Build

For many projects the beginning of "work" in the Pipeline would be the "build"
stage. Typically this stage of the Pipeline will be where source code is
assembled, compiled, or packaged. The `Jenkinsfile` is *not* a replacement for an
existing build tool such as GNU/Make, Maven, Gradle, etc, but rather can be
viewed as a glue layer to bind the multiple phases of a project's development
lifecycle (build, test, deploy, etc) together.

Jenkins has a number of plugins for invoking practically any build tool in
general use, but this example will simply invoke `make` from a shell step
(`sh`).  The `sh` step assumes the system is Unix/Linux-based, for
Windows-based systems the `bat` could be used instead.

[pipeline]
----
// Script //
node {
    /* .. snip .. */
    stage('Build') {
        sh 'make' // <1>
        archiveArtifacts artifacts: '**/target/*.jar', fingerprint: true // <2>
    }
    /* .. snip .. */
}
// Declarative not yet implemented //
----
<1> The `sh` step invokes the `make` command and will only continue if a
zero exit code is returned by the command. Any non-zero exit code will fail the
Pipeline.
<2> `archiveArtifacts` captures the files built matching the include pattern
(`**/target/*.jar`) and saves them to the Jenkins master for later retrieval.


[CAUTION]
====
Archiving artifacts is not a substitute for using external artifact
repositories such as Artifactory or Nexus and should be considered only for
basic reporting and file archival.
====

=== Test

Running automated tests is a crucial component of any successful continuous
delivery process. As such, Jenkins has a number of test recording, reporting,
and visualization facilities provided by a
link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/?labels=report[number of plugins].
At a fundamental level, when there are test failures, it is useful to have
Jenkins record the failures for reporting and visualization in the web UI.  The
example below uses the `junit` step, provided by the
link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/junit[JUnit plugin].

In the example below, if tests fail, the Pipeline is marked "unstable", as
denoted by a yellow ball in the web UI. Based on the recorded test reports,
Jenkins can also provide historical trend analysis and visualization.

[pipeline]
----
// Script //
node {
    /* .. snip .. */
    stage('Test') {
        /* `make check` returns non-zero on test failures,
         * using `true` to allow the Pipeline to continue nonetheless
         */
        sh 'make check || true' // <1>
        junit '**/target/*.xml' // <2>
    }
    /* .. snip .. */
}
// Declarative not yet implemented //
----
<1> Using an inline shell conditional (`sh 'make || true'`) ensures that the
`sh` step always sees a zero exit code, giving the `junit` step the opportunity
to capture and process the test reports. Alternative approaches to this are
covered in more detail in the <<handling-failures>> section below.
<2> `junit` captures and associates the JUnit XML files matching the inclusion
pattern (`**/target/*.xml`).

=== Deploy

Deployment can imply a variety of steps, depending on the project or
organization requirements, and may be anything from publishing built artifacts
to an Artifactory server, to pushing code to a production system.

At this stage of the example Pipeline, both the "Build" and "Test" stages have
successfully executed. In essense, the "Deploy" stage will only execute
assuming previous stages completed successfully, otherwise the Pipeline would
have exited early.

[pipeline]
----
// Script //
node {
    /* .. snip .. */
    stage('Deploy') {
        if (currentBuild.result == 'SUCCESS') { // <1>
            sh 'make publish'
        }
    }
    /* .. snip .. */
}
// Declarative not yet implemented //
----
<1> Accessing the `currentBuild.result` variable allows the Pipeline Script to
determine if there were any test failures. In which case, the value would be
`UNSTABLE`.

Assuming everything has executed successfully in the example Jenkins Pipeline,
each successful Pipeline run will have associated build artifacts archived,
test results reported upon and the full console output all in Jenkins.

A Pipeline Script can include conditional tests (shown above), loops,
try/catch/finally blocks and even functions. The next section will cover this
more advanced Pipeline Script syntax in more detail.


== Advanced Syntax for Pipeline Scripts

Pipeline Script is a domain-specific language
footnoteref:[dsl, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language]
based on Groovy, most
link:http://groovy-lang.org/semantics.html[Groovy syntax]
can be in Pipeline Script without modification.

=== String Interpolation

Groovy's "String" interpolation support can be confusing to many newcomers to
the language. While Groovy supports declaring a string with either single quotes, or
double quotes, for example:

[source,groovy]
----
def singlyQuoted = 'Hello'
def doublyQuoted = "World"
----

Only the latter string will support the dollar-sign (`$`) based string
interpolation, for example:

[source,groovy]
----
def username = 'Jenkins'
echo 'Hello Mr. ${username}'
echo "I said, Hello Mr. ${username}"
----

Would result in:

[source]
----
Hello Mr. ${username}
I said, Hello Mr. Jenkins
----

Understanding how to use Groovy's string interpolation is vital for using some
of Pipeline Script's more advanced features.

=== Working with the Environment

Jenkins Pipeline exposes environment variables via the global variable `env`,
which is available from anywhere within a `Jenkinsfile`. The full list of
environment variables accessible from within Jenkins Pipeline is documented at
link:http://localhost:8080/pipeline-syntax/globals#env[localhost:8080/pipeline-syntax/globals#env],
assuming a Jenkins master is running on `localhost:8080`, and includes:

BUILD_ID:: The current build ID, identical to BUILD_NUMBER for builds created in Jenkins versions 1.597+
JOB_NAME:: Name of the project of this build, such as "foo" or "foo/bar".
JENKINS_URL:: Full URL of Jenkins, such as http://example.com:port/jenkins/ (NOTE: only available if Jenkins URL set in "System Configuration")


Referencing or using these environment variables can be accomplished like
accessing any key in a Groovy
link:http://groovy-lang.org/syntax.html#_maps[Map],
for example:

[pipeline]
----
// Script //
node {
    echo "Running ${env.BUILD_ID} on ${env.JENKINS_URL}"
}
// Declarative not yet implemented //
----


==== Setting environment variables

Setting an environment variable within a Jenkins Pipeline can be done with the
`withEnv` step, which allows overriding specified environment variables for a
given block of Pipeline Script, for example:

[pipeline]
----
// Script //
node {
    /* .. snip .. */
    withEnv(["PATH+MAVEN=${tool 'M3'}/bin"]) {
        sh 'mvn -B verify'
    }
}
// Declarative not yet implemented //
----


=== Build Parameters

If you configured your pipeline to accept parameters using the *Build with
Parameters* option, those parameters are accessible as Groovy variables of the
same name.


Assuming that a String parameter named "Greeting" has been configured for the
Pipeline project in the web UI, a `Jenkinsfile` can access that parameter via
`$Greeting`:

[pipeline]
----
// Script //
node {
    echo "${Greeting} World!"
}
// Declarative not yet implemented //
----

/////
TODO: Expand this section with more examples
/////

=== Handling Failures

Pipeline Script relies on Groovy's built-in `try`/`catch`/`finally` semantics
for handling failures during execution of the Pipeline.

In the <<test>> example above, the `sh` step was modified to never return a
non-zero exit code (`sh 'make check || true'`). This approach, while valid,
means the following stages need to check `currentBuild.result` to know if
there has been a test failure or not.

An alternative way of handling this, which preserves the early-exit behavior of
failures in Pipeline, while still giving `junit` the chance to capture test
reports, is to use a series of `try`/`finally` blocks:

[pipeline]
----
// Script //
node {
    /* .. snip .. */
    stage('Test') {
        try {
            sh 'make check'
        }
        finally {
            junit '**/target/*.xml'
        }
    }
    /* .. snip .. */
}
// Declarative not yet implemented //
----

=== Using multiple nodes

In all previous uses of the `node` step, it has been used without any
arguments. This means Jenkins will allocate an executor wherever one is
available. The `node` step can take an optional "label" parameter, which is
helpful for more advanced use-cases such as  executing builds/tests across
multiple platforms.

In the example below, the "Build" stage will be performed on one node and
the built results will be reused on two different nodes, labelled "linux" and
"windows" respectively, during the "Test" stage.

[pipeline]
----
// Script //
stage('Build') {
    node {
        checkout scm
        sh 'make'
        stash includes: '**/target/*.jar', name: 'app' // <1>
    }
}

stage('Test') {
    node('linux') { // <2>
        checkout scm
        try {
            unstash 'app' // <3>
            sh 'make check'
        }
        finally {
            junit '**/target/*.xml'
        }
    }
    node('windows') {
        checkout scm
        try {
            unstash 'app'
            bat 'make check' // <4>
        }
        finally {
            junit '**/target/*.xml'
        }
    }
}
// Declarative not yet implemented //
----
<1> The `stash` step allows capturing files matching an inclusion pattern
(`**/target/*.jar`) for reuse within the _same_ Pipeline. Once the Pipeline has
completed its execution, stashed files are deleted from the Jenkins master.
<2> The optional parameter to `node` allows for any valid Jenkins label
expression. Consult the inline help for `node` in the <<getting-started#snippet-generator#, Snippet Generator>> for more details.
<3> `unstash` will retrieve the named "stash" from the Jenkins master into the
Pipeline's current workspace.
<4> The `bat` script allows for executing batch scripts on Windows-based
platforms.

=== Executing in parallel

The example in the <<using-multiple-nodes,section above>> runs tests across two
different platforms in a linear series. In practice, if the `make check`
execution takes 30 minutes to complete, the "Test" stage would now take 60
minutes to complete!

Fortunately, Pipeline has built-in functionality for executing portions of
Pipeline Script in parallel, implemented in the aptly named `parallel` step.

Refactoring the example above to use the `parallel` step:

[pipeline]
----
// Script //
stage('Build') {
    /* .. snip .. */
}

stage('Test') {
    parallel linux: {
        node('linux') {
            checkout scm
            try {
                unstash 'app'
                sh 'make check'
            }
            finally {
                junit '**/target/*.xml'
            }
        }
    },
    windows: {
        node('windows') {
            /* .. snip .. */
        }
    }
}
// Declarative not yet implemented //
----

Instead of executing the tests on the "linux" and "windows" labelled nodes in
series, they will now execute in parallel assuming the requisite capacity
exists in the Jenkins environment.


=== Optional step arguments

Groovy allows parentheses around function arguments to be omitted.

Many Pipeline steps also use the named-parameter syntax as a shorthand for
creating a Map in Groovy, which uses the syntax `[key1: value1, key2: value2]`.
Making statements like the following functionally equivalent:

[source, groovy]
----
git url: 'git://example.com/amazing-project.git', branch: 'master'
git([url: 'git://example.com/amazing-project.git', branch: 'master'])
----

For convenience, when calling steps taking only one parameter (or only one
mandatory parameter), the parameter name may be omitted, for example:

[source, groovy]
----
sh 'echo hello' /* short form  */
sh([script: 'echo hello'])  /* long form */
----
