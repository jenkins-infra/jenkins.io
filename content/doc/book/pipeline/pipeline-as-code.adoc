= Pipeline as Code


_Pipeline as Code_ describes a set of features that allow Jenkins users to
define pipelined job processes with code, stored and versioned in a source
repository.  These features allow Jenkins to discover, manage, and run jobs for
multiple source repositories and branches -- eliminating the need for manual job
creation and management.

To use _Pipeline as Code_, projects must contain a file named `Jenkinsfile` in
the repository root, which contains a "Pipeline script."

Additionally, one of the enabling jobs needs to be configured in Jenkins:

* _Multibranch Pipeline_: build multiple branches of a _single_ repository automatically
* _Organization Folders_: scan a *GitHub Organization* or *Bitbucket Team* to
  discover an organization's repositories, automatically creating managed
  _Multibranch Pipeline_ jobs for them
* _Pipeline_: Regular Pipeline jobs have an option when specifying the pipeline to "Use SCM".


Fundamentally, an organization's repositories can be viewed as a hierarchy,
where each repository may have child elements of branches and pull requests.

.Example Repository Structure
[source]
....
+--- GitHub Organization
    +--- Project 1
        +--- master
        +--- feature-branch-a
        +--- feature-branch-b
    +--- Project 2
        +--- master
        +--- pull-request-1
        +--- etc...
....
[source]

Prior to _Multibranch Pipeline_ jobs and _Organization Folders_,
plugin:cloudbees-folder[Folders]
could be used to create this hierarchy in Jenkins by organizing repositories
into folders containing jobs for each individual branch.

_Multibranch Pipeline_ and _Organization Folders_ eliminate the manual process
by detecting branches and repositories, respectively, and creating appropriate
folders with jobs in Jenkins automatically.


== The Jenkinsfile

Presence of the `Jenkinsfile` in the root of a repository makes it eligible for
Jenkins to automatically manage and execute jobs based on repository branches.

The `Jenkinsfile` should contain a Pipeline script, specifying the steps to
execute the job.  The script has all the power of Pipeline available, from
something as simple as invoking a Maven builder, to a series of interdependent
steps, which have coordinated parallel execution with deployment and validation
phases.

A simple way to get started with Pipeline is to use the _Snippet Generator_
available in the configuration screen for a Jenkins _Pipeline_ job.  Using the
_Snippet Generator_, you can create a Pipeline script as you might through the
dropdowns in other Jenkins jobs.


== Folder Computation

_Multibranch Pipeline_ projects and _Organization Folders_ extend the existing
folder functionality by introducing 'computed' folders.  Computed folders
automatically run a process to manage the folder contents.  This computation, in
the case of _Multibranch Pipeline_ projects, creates child items for each
eligible branch within the child.  For _Organization Folders_, computation
populates child items for repositories as individual _Multibranch Pipelines_.

Folder computation may happen automatically via webhook callbacks, as branches
and repositories are created or removed.  Computation may also be triggered by
the _Build Trigger_ defined in the configuration, which will automatically run a
computation task after a period of inactivity (this defaults to run after one
day).

image::folder-computation-build-trigger-schedule.png[scaledwidth="75%"]

Information about the last execution of the folder computation is available in
the *Folder Computation* section.

[role="image-border"]
image::folder-computation-main.png[scaledwidth="75%",width="75%"]

The log from the last attempt to compute the folder is available from this page.
If folder computation doesn't result in an expected set of repositories, the log
may have useful information to diagnose the problem.

[role="image-border"]
image::folder-computation-log.png[scaledwidth="75%",width="75%"]


== Configuration

Both _Multibranch Pipeline_ projects and _Organization Folders_ have
configuration options to allow precise selection of repositories.  These
features also allow selection of two types of credentials to use when connecting
to the remote systems:

* _scan_ credentials, which are used for accessing the GitHub or Bitbucket APIs
* _checkout_ credentials, which are used when the repository is cloned from the
  remote system; it may be useful to choose an SSH key or _"- anonymous -"_,
  which uses the default credentials configured for the OS user

IMPORTANT: If you are using a _GitHub Organization_, you should link:https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo,public_repo,admin:repo_hook,admin:org_hook&amp;description=Jenkins+Access[create a GitHub access token] to use to avoid storing your password in Jenkins and prevent any issues when using the GitHub API.
When using a GitHub access token, you must use standard _Username with password_ credentials, where the username is the same as your GitHub username and the password is your access token.

=== Multibranch Pipeline Projects

_Multibranch Pipeline_ projects are one of the fundamental enabling features for
_Pipeline as Code_.  Changes to the build or deployment procedure can evolve
with project requirements and the job always reflects the current state of the
project.  It also allows you to configure different jobs for different branches
of the same project, or to forgo a job if appropriate.  The `Jenkinsfile` in the
root directory of a branch or pull request identifies a multibranch project.

NOTE:  _Multibranch Pipeline_ projects expose the name of the branch being built with
the `BRANCH_NAME` environment variable and provide a special `checkout scm`
Pipeline command, which is guaranteed to check out the specific commit that the
Jenkinsfile originated.  If the Jenkinsfile needs to check out the repository
for any reason, make sure to use `checkout scm`, as it also accounts for
alternate origin repositories to handle things like pull requests.

To create a _Multibranch Pipeline_, go to: _New Item -> Multibranch Pipeline_.
Configure the SCM source as appropriate.  There are options for many different
types of repositories and services including Git, Mercurial, Bitbucket, and
GitHub.  If using GitHub, for example, click *Add source*, select GitHub and
configure the appropriate owner, scan credentials, and repository.

Other options available to _Multibranch Pipeline_ projects are:

* *API endpoint* - an alternate API endpoint to use a self-hosted GitHub Enterprise
* *Checkout credentials* - alternate credentials to use when checking out the code (cloning)
* *Include branches* - a regular expression to specify branches to include
* *Exclude branches* - a regular expression to specify branches to exclude; note that this will take precedence over includes
* *Property strategy* - if necessary, define custom properties for each branch

After configuring these items and saving the configuration, Jenkins will
automatically scan the repository and import appropriate branches.

=== Organization Folders

Organization Folders offer a convenient way to allow Jenkins to automatically manage which repositories are automatically included in Jenkins.
Particularly, if your organization utilizes _GitHub Organizations_ or _Bitbucket Teams_, any time a developer creates a new repository
with a `Jenkinsfile`, Jenkins will automatically detect it and create a _Multibranch Pipeline_ project for it.
This alleviates the need for administrators or developers to manually create projects for these new repositories.

To create an _Organization Folder_ in Jenkins, go to: *New Item -> GitHub Organization* or *New Item -> Bitbucket Team* and follow the configuration steps for each item,
making sure to specify appropriate _Scan Credentials_ and a specific *owner* for the GitHub Organization or Bitbucket Team name, respectively.

Other options available are:

* *Repository name pattern* - a regular expression to specify which repositories are *included*
* *API endpoint* - an alternate API endpoint to use a self-hosted GitHub Enterprise
* *Checkout credentials* - alternate credentials to use when checking out the code (cloning)

After configuring these items and saving the configuration, Jenkins will automatically scan the organization and import appropriate repositories and resulting branches.


=== Orphaned Item Strategy

Computed folders can remove items immediately or leave them based on a desired retention strategy.
By default, items will be removed as soon as the folder computation determines they are no longer present.
If your organization requires these items remain available for a longer period of time, simply configure the Orphaned Item Strategy appropriately.
It may be useful to keep items in order to examine build results of a branch after it's been removed, for example.

[role="image-border"]
image::orphaned-item-strategy.png[alt = "Orphaned Item Strategy section in Jenkins configuration page for organization folder, showing the 'discard old items' option as checked, with fields for 'Days to keep old items' and 'Max # of old items to keep', both with empty input boxes. Checkbox to 'Abort builds' is unchecked.",scaledwidth="75%",width="80%"]

=== Icon and View Strategy

You can also configure a custom icon for folder display by installing the "Custom Folder Icon" plugin.
For example, it might be useful to display an aggregate health of the child builds.
Alternately, you might reference the same icon you use in your GitHub organization account.

[role="image-border"]
image::folder-icon.png[alt = "Appearance section in Jenkins configuration page for organization folder, showing icon field with 'Custom Folder Icon' option selected. This section includes an option to choose an image file for the icon, along with an Apply button to save your changes.",scaledwidth="75%", width="80%"]


== Example

To demonstrate using an Organization Folder to manage repositories, we'll use
the fictitious organization: CloudBeers, Inc..

Go to *New Item*.
Enter 'cloudbeers' for the item name.
Select *GitHub Organization* and click *OK*.

[role="image-border"]
image::organization-folder-creation.png[alt = "Jenkins New Item page with item name as 'CloudBeersInc' and Organization Folder option selected from the options for item type given as follows: Freestyle project, Pipeline, Multi-configuration project, Folder, Multi-branch Pipeline and Organization Folder.",scaledwidth="75%"]

Optionally, enter a better descriptive name for the _Description_, such as 'CloudBeers GitHub'.
In the _Repository Sources_ section, complete the section for "GitHub Organization".
Make sure the *owner* matches the GitHub Organization name exactly, in our case it must be: _cloudbeers_.
This defaults to the same value that was entered for the item name in the first step.
Next, select or add new "Scan credentials" - we'll enter our GitHub username and access token as the password.

[role="image-border"]
image::github-configuration-for-organization-folder.png[alt = "Projects section in the Jenkins configuration page for a GitHub Organization repository source includes fields to specify the API endpoint, credentials, and repository owner, which is set to 'CloudBeersInc'. Additionally, there are options to enable avatar display and define behaviors such as discovering branches, pull requests from origin, and pull requests from forks. Each behavior has a strategy dropdown for specific configurations, along with options for setting trust levels for pull requests from forks.",scaledwidth="75%", width="80%"]

After saving, the "Folder Computation" will run to scan for eligible repositories, followed by multibranch builds.

[role="image-border"]
image::organization-repositories-scan.png[alt = "Jenkins Build Queue and Build Executor Status view. The Build Queue section shows 'No builds in the queue'. The Build Executor Status section displays ongoing builds under the 'Built-In Node' with progress indicators. Three jobs are actively running: 'PR-demo repository (master branch) from the CloudBeersInc organization', 'community-docs repository (main branch) from the CloudBeersInc organization', and 'multibranch-demo repository (master branch) from the CloudBeersInc organization'. Each has a blue progress bar. Below, the 'docker-ssh-jenkins-agent' is listed as idle with a status of '1 Idle' at the bottom.",scaledwidth="75%"]

Refresh the page after the job runs to ensure the view of repositories has been updated.

[role="image-border"]
image::organization-folder-repositories.png[alt = "Jenkins dashboard view for the 'CloudBeersInc' organization. The status section shows the repository count as 'Repositories (3)' with a table listing three repositories: 'community-docs', 'multibranch-demo', and 'PR-demo'. Each repository entry includes columns labeled 'S' for status of last build, 'W' for weather status of recent aggregated builds, 'Name', and 'Description'. The 'multibranch-demo' repository contains a description stating, 'Simple demonstration of how to use multibranch pipelines'. Icon size options (S, M, L) are available below the table.",scaledwidth="75%"]

A this point, you're finished with basic project configuration and can now explore your imported repositories.
You can also investigate the results of the jobs run as part of the initial _Folder Computation_.

== Continuous Delivery with Pipeline

////
TODO: This section is remedial and doesn't flow properly. Suggest rewrite
////
Continuous delivery allows organizations to deliver software with lower risk.
The path to continuous delivery starts by modeling the software delivery
pipeline used within the organization and then focusing on the automation of it
all. Early, directed feedback, enabled by pipeline automation enables software
delivery more quickly over traditional methods of delivery.

Jenkins is the Swiss army knife in the software delivery toolchain. Developers
and operations (DevOps) personnel have different mindsets and use different
tools to get their respective jobs done. Since Jenkins integrates with a huge
variety of toolsets, it serves as the intersection point between development and
operations teams.

Many organizations have been orchestrating pipelines with existing Jenkins
plugins for several years. As their automation sophistication and their own
Jenkins experience increases, organizations inevitably want to move beyond
simple pipelines and create complex flows specific to their delivery process.

These Jenkins users require a feature that treats complex pipelines as a
first-class object, and so the plugin:workflow-aggregator[Pipeline plugin]
was developed .

=== Pre-requisites

Continuous delivery is a process - rather than a tool - and requires a mindset
and culture that must percolate from the top-down within an organization. Once
the organization has bought into the philosophy, the next and most difficult
part is mapping the flow of software as it makes its way from development to
production.

The root of such a pipeline will always be an orchestration tool like a Jenkins,
but there are some key requirements that such an integral part of the pipeline
must satisfy before it can be tasked with enterprise-critical processes:

* *Zero or low downtime disaster recovery*: A commit, just as a mythical hero,
  encounters harder and longer challenges as it makes its way down the pipeline.
  It is not unusual to see pipeline executions that last days. A hardware or a
  Jenkins failure on day six of a seven-day pipeline has serious consequences
  for on-time delivery of a product.
* *Audit runs and debug ability*: Build managers like to see the exact execution
  flow through the pipeline, so they can easily debug issues.


To ensure a tool can scale with an organization and suitably automate existing delivery pipelines without changing them, the tool should also support:

* *Complex pipelines*: Delivery pipelines are typically more complex than
  canonical examples (linear process: Dev->Test->Deploy, with a couple of
  operations at each stage). Build managers want constructs that help
  parallelize parts of the flow, run loops, perform retries and so forth. Stated
  differently, build managers want programming constructs to define pipelines.

* *Manual interventions*: Pipelines cross intra-organizational boundaries
  necessitating manual handoffs and interventions. Build managers seek
  capabilities such as being able to pause a pipeline for a human to intervene
  and make manual decisions.

The Pipeline plugin allows users to create such a pipeline through a new job
type called Pipeline. The flow definition is captured in a Groovy script, thus
adding control flow capabilities such as loops, forks and retries. Pipeline
allows for stages with the option to set concurrencies, preventing multiple
builds of the same pipeline from trying to access the same resource at the same
time.

=== Concepts

.Pipeline Job Type

There is just one job to capture the entire software delivery pipeline in an
organization. Of course, you can still connect two Pipeline job types together
if you want. A Pipeline job type uses a Groovy-based DSL for job definitions.
    The DSL affords the advantage of defining jobs programmatically:


[source, groovy]
----
node('linux'){
  git url: 'https://github.com/jglick/simple-maven-project-with-tests.git'
  def mvnHome = tool 'M3'
  env.PATH = "${mvnHome}/bin:${env.PATH}"
  sh 'mvn -B clean verify'
}
----

.Stages

Intra-organizational (or conceptual) boundaries are captured through a primitive
called "stages." A deployment pipeline consists of various stages, where each
subsequent stage builds on the previous one. The idea is to spend as few
resources as possible early in the pipeline and find obvious issues, rather than
spend a lot of computing resources for something that is ultimately discovered
to be broken.

[[throttled-concurrent]]
.Throttled stage concurrency with Pipeline
image::stage-concurrency.png[scaledwidth="90%"]

Consider a simple pipeline with three stages. A naive implementation of this
pipeline can sequentially trigger each stage on every commit. Thus, the
deployment step is triggered immediately after the Selenium test steps are
complete. However, this would mean that the deployment from commit two overrides
the last deployment in motion from commit one. The right approach is for commits
two and three to wait for the deployment from commit one to complete,
consolidate all the changes that have happened since commit one and trigger the
deployment. If there is an issue, developers can easily figure out if the issue
was introduced in commit two or commit three.

Pipeline provides this functionality by enhancing the stage primitive.  For
example, a stage can have a concurrency level of one defined to indicate that at
any point only one thread should be running through the stage. This achieves the
desired state of running a deployment as fast as it should run.

[source, groovy]
----
 stage name: 'Production', concurrency: 1
 node {
     unarchive mapping: ['target/x.war' : 'x.war']
     deploy 'target/x.war', 'production'
     echo 'Deployed to http://localhost:8888/production/'
 }
----

.Gates and Approvals

Continuous delivery means having binaries in a release ready state whereas
continuous deployment means pushing the binaries to production - or automated
deployments. Although continuous deployment is a sexy term and a desired state,
in reality organizations still want a human to give the final approval before
bits are pushed to production.  This is captured through the "input" primitive
in Pipeline. The input step can wait indefinitely for a human to intervene.

[source, groovy]
----
input message: "Does http://localhost:8888/staging/ look good?"
----

.Deployment of Artifacts to Staging/Production

Deployment of binaries is the last mile in a pipeline. The numerous servers
employed within the organization and available in the market make it difficult
to employ a uniform deployment step. Today, these are solved by third-party
deployer products whose job it is to focus on deployment of a particular stack
to a data center. Teams can also write their own extensions to hook into the
Pipeline job type and make the deployment easier.

Meanwhile, job creators can write a plain old Groovy function to define any
custom steps that can deploy (or undeploy) artifacts from production.

[source, groovy]
----
def deploy(war, id) {
    sh "cp ${war} /tmp/webapps/${id}.war"
}
----

.Restartable flows

All Pipelines are resumable, so if Jenkins needs to be restarted while a flow is
running, it should resume at the same point in its execution after Jenkins
starts back up. Similarly, if a flow is running a lengthy sh or bat step when an
agent unexpectedly disconnects, no progress should be lost when connectivity is
restored.

There are some cases when a flow build will have done a great deal of work and
proceeded to a point where a transient error occurred: one which does not
reflect the inputs to this build, such as source code changes. For example,
after completing a lengthy build and test of a software component, final
deployment to a server might fail because of network problems.


.Pipeline Stage View

When you have complex builds pipelines, it is useful to see the progress of each
stage and to see where build failures are occurring in the pipeline. This can
enable users to debug which tests are failing at which stage or if there are
other problems in their pipeline. Many organization also want to make their
pipelines user-friendly for non-developers without having to develop a homegrown
UI, which can prove to be a lengthy and ongoing development effort.

The Pipeline Stage View feature offers extended visualization of Pipeline build
history on the index page of a flow project. This visualization also includes
helpful metrics like average run time by stage and by build, and a user-friendly
interface for interacting with input steps.

.Pipeline Stage View plugin
image::workflow-big-responsive.png[scaledwidth="90%"]

The only prerequisite for this plugin is a pipeline with defined stages in the
flow. There can be as many stages as you desired and they can be in a linear
sequence, and the stage names will be displayed as columns in the Stage View
interface.

==== Artifact traceability with fingerprints

Traceability is important for DevOps teams who need to be able to trace code
from commit to deployment. It enables impact analysis by showing relationships
between artifacts and allows for visibility into the full lifecycle of an
artifact, from its code repository to where the artifact is eventually deployed
in production.

Jenkins and the Pipeline feature support tracking versions of artifacts using
file fingerprinting, which allows users to trace which downstream builds are
using any given artifact. To fingerprint with Pipeline, simply add a
"fingerprint: true" argument to any artifact archiving step. For example:

[source, groovy]
----
archiveArtifacts artifacts: '**', fingerprint: true
----

will archive any WAR artifacts created in the Pipeline and fingerprint them for
traceability. This trace log of this artifact and a list of all fingerprinted
artifacts in a build will then be available in the left-hand menu of Jenkins:

To find where an artifact is used and deployed to, simply follow the "more
details" link through the artifact's name and view the entries for the artifact
in its "Usage" list.
