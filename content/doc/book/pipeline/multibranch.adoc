= Branches and Pull Requests

In the <<jenkinsfile#, previous section>> a `Jenkinsfile` which could be
checked into source control was implemented. This section covers the concept of
*Multibranch* Pipelines which build on the `Jenkinsfile` foundation to provide
more dynamic and automatic functionality in Jenkins.

== Creating a Multibranch Pipeline

The *Multibranch Pipeline* project type enables you to implement different
Jenkinsfiles for different branches of the same project.
In a Multibranch Pipeline project, Jenkins automatically discovers, manages and
executes Pipelines for branches which contain a `Jenkinsfile` in source control.

This eliminates the need for manual Pipeline creation and management.

To create a Multibranch Pipeline:

* Click *New Item* on Jenkins home page.

* Enter a name for your Pipeline, select *Multibranch Pipeline* and click *OK*.

[CAUTION]
====
Jenkins uses the name of the Pipeline to create directories on disk. Pipeline
names which include spaces may uncover bugs in scripts which do not expect
paths to contain spaces.

* Add a *Branch Source* (for example, Git) and enter the location of the
  repository.

* *Save* the Multibranch Pipeline project.

Upon *Save*, Jenkins automatically scans the designated repository and creates
appropriate items for each branch in the repository which contains a
`Jenkinsfile`.

By default, Jenkins will not automatically re-index the repository for branch
additions or deletions (unless using an <<organization-folders,Organization Folder>>),
so it is often useful to configure a Multibranch Pipeline to periodically
re-index in the configuration:

=== Additional Environment Variables

Multibranch Pipelines expose additional information about the branch being
built through the `env` global variable, such as:

BRANCH_NAME:: Name of the branch for which this Pipeline is executing, for
example `master`.

CHANGE_ID:: An identifier corresponding to some kind of change request, such as a pull request number

Additional environment variables are listed in the
<<getting-started#global-variable-reference#, Global Variable Reference>>.


=== Supporting Pull Requests

With the "GitHub" or "Bitbucket" Branch Sources, Multibranch Pipelines can be
used for validating pull/change requests. This functionality is provided,
respectively, by the
plugin:github-branch-source[GitHub Branch Source]
and
plugin:cloudbees-bitbucket-branch-source[Bitbucket Branch Source]
plugins. Please consult their documentation for further information on how to
use those plugins.


[[organization-folders]]
== Using Organization Folders

Organization Folders enable Jenkins to monitor an entire GitHub
Organization, or Bitbucket Team/Project and automatically create new
Multibranch Pipelines for repositories which contain branches and pull requests
containing a `Jenkinsfile`.

Currently, this functionality exists only for GitHub and Bitbucket, with
functionality provided by the
plugin:github-organization-folder[GitHub Organization Folder]
and
plugin:cloudbees-bitbucket-branch-source[Bitbucket Branch Source]
plugins.
