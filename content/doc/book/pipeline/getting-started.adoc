= Getting Started

Jenkins Pipeline is a suite of plugins which supports implementing and
integrating continuous delivery pipelines into Jenkins. Pipeline provides an
extensible set of tools for modeling simple-to-complex delivery pipelines "as
code" via the Pipeline DSL.
footnoteref:[dsl,link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language[Domain-Specific Language]]

This section introduces some of the key concepts to Jenkins Pipeline and
help introduce the basics of defining and working with Pipelines inside of a
running Jenkins instance.

== Prerequisites

To use Jenkins Pipeline, you will need:

* Jenkins 2.x or later (older versions back to 1.642.3 may work but are not
  recommended)
* Pipeline plugin
footnoteref:[pipeline, link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-aggregator[Pipeline plugin]]

To learn how to install and manage plugins, consult <<../managing/plugins#, Managing Plugins>>.

== Defining a Pipeline

Pipeline Script is written in
link:http://groovy-lang.org/[Groovy].
The relevant bits of
link:http://groovy-lang.org/semantics.html[Groovy syntax]
will be introduced as necessary in this document, so while an understanding of
Groovy is helpful, it is not required to use Pipeline Script.

A basic Pipeline can be created in either of the following ways:

* By entering a script directly in the Jenkins web UI.
* By creating a `Jenkinsfile` which can be checked into a project's source
  control repository.

The syntax for defining a Pipeline with either approach is the same, but while
Jenkins supports entering Pipeline Script directly into the web UI, it's
generally considered best practice to define the Pipeline in a `Jenkinsfile`
which Jenkins will then load directly from source control.
footnoteref:[scm, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_control_management]


=== Defining a Pipeline in the Web UI

To create a basic Pipeline in the Jenkins web UI, follow these steps:

* Click *New Item* on Jenkins home page.

image::new-item-selection.png["Click *New Item* on the Jenkins home page", role=center]

* Enter a name for your Pipeline, select *Pipeline* and click *OK*.

[CAUTION]
====
Jenkins uses the name of the Pipeline to create directories on disk. Pipeline
names which include spaces may uncover bugs in scripts which do not expect
paths to contain spaces.
====

* In the *Script* text area, enter a Pipeline script and click *Save*.

image::hello-world-script.png["In the *Script* text area, enter a Pipeline script and click Save", role=center]

* Click *Build Now* to run the Pipeline.

image::build-now.png["Click *Build Now* to run the Pipeline", role=center]


* Click *#1* under "Build History" and then click *Console Output* to see the
  full output from the Pipeline.

image::hello-world-console-output.png["Click *Console Output* for the Pipeline", role=center]

The example above shows a successful run of a basic Pipeline created in the Jenkins
web UI, using two steps.

[pipeline]
----
// Script //
node { // <1>
    echo 'Hello World' // <2>
}
// Declarative not yet implemented //
----
<1> `node` allocates an executor and workspace in the Jenkins environment.
<2> `echo` writes simple string in the Console Output.

=== Defining a Pipeline in SCM

Complex pipelines are hard to write and maintain within the text area of the
Pipeline configuration page. If necessary, you can write Pipeline scripts
(Jenkinsfiles) in a text editor and access them in Jenkins with the *Pipeline
Script from SCM* option.

Loading pipeline scripts using the `checkout scm` step leverages the
idea of "Pipeline as Code" and allows easy maintenance of Pipelines with source
control and text-editors.

To do this, select *Pipeline script from SCM* when defining the pipeline.

With the *Pipeline script from SCM* option selected, you do not enter any Groovy
code in the Jenkins UI; you just indicate by specifying a path where in source
code you want to retrieve the pipeline from. When you update the designated
repository, a new build is triggered, as long as your job is configured with an
SCM polling trigger.

[TIP]
====
The first line of a `Jenkinsfile` should be `#!groovy`
footnoteref:[shebang, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)]
which text editors, IDEs, GitHub, etc will use to syntax highlight the
`Jenkinsfile` properly as Groovy code.

== Built-in Documentation

Pipeline ships with built-in documentation features to make it
easier to create Pipelines of varying complexities. This built-in documentation
is automatically generated and updated based on the plugins installed in the
Jenkins instance.

The built-in documentation can be found globally at:
link:http://localhost:8080[localhost:8080/pipeline-syntax/],
assuming you have a Jenkins instance running on localhost port 8080. The same
documentation is also linked as *Pipeline Syntax* in the side-bar for any
configured Pipeline project.

image::pipeline-syntax-sidebar.png[Pipeline Syntax in the side-bar, role=center]

[[snippet-generator]]
=== Snippet Generator

The built-in "Snippet Generator" utility is helpful for creating bits of
code for individual steps, discovering new steps provided by plugins, or
experimenting with different parameters for a particular step.

The Snippet Generator is dynamically populated with a list of the steps
available to the Jenkins instance. The number of steps available is dependent
on the plugins installed which explicitly expose steps for use in Pipeline.

To generate a step snippet with the Snippet Generator:

. Navigate to the *Pipeline Syntax* link (referenced above) from a configured Pipeline, or at link:http://localhost:8080/pipeline-syntax[localhost:8080/pipeline-syntax].
. Select the desired step in the *Sample Step* dropdown menu
. Use the dynamically populated area below the *Sample Step* dropdown to configure the selected step.
. Click *Generate Pipeline Script* to create a snippet of Pipeline which can be
copied and pasted into a Pipeline.

image::snippet-generator.png[Snippet Generator, role=center]

To access additional information and/or documentation about the step selected,
click on the help icon (indicated by the red arrow in the image above).

=== Global Variable Reference

In addition to the Snippet Generator, which only surfaces steps, Pipeline also
provides a built-in "*Global Variable Reference*." Like the Snippet Generator,
it is also dynamically populated by plugins. Unlike the Snippet Generator
however, the Global Variable Reference only contains documentation for
*variables* provided by Pipeline or plugins, which are available for
Pipelines.

The variables provided by default in Pipeline are:

env::

Environment variables accessible from Pipeline Script, for example:
`env.PATH` or `env.BUILD_ID`. Consult the built-in
link:http://localhost:8080/pipeline-syntax/globals#env[Global Variable Reference]
for a complete, and up to date, list of environment variables
available in Pipeline.

params::

Exposes all parameters defined for the Pipeline as a read-only
link:http://groovy-lang.org/syntax.html#_maps[Map],
for example: `params.MY_PARAM_NAME`.

currentBuild::

May be used to discover information about the currently executing Pipeline,
with properties such as `currentBuild.result`, `currentBuild.displayName`,
etc. Consult the built-in
link:http://localhost:8080/pipeline-syntax/globals#currentBuild[Global Variable Reference]
for a complete, and up to date, list of properties available on `currentBuild`.


== Further Reading

This section merely scratches the surface of what can be done with Jenkins
Pipeline, but should provide enough of a foundation for you to start
experimenting with a test Jenkins instance.

In the next section, <<jenkinsfile#, The Jenkinsfile>>, more Pipeline steps
will be discussed along with patterns for implementing successful, real-world,
Jenkins Pipelines.
