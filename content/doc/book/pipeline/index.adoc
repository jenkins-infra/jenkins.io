[[overview]]
== What is Jenkins Pipeline?

Jenkins Pipeline (or simply "Pipeline" with a capital "P") is a suite of plugins
which supports implementing and integrating _continuous delivery pipelines_ into
Jenkins.

A _continuous delivery (CD) pipeline_ is an automated expression of your process
for getting software from version control right through to your users and
customers. Every change to your software (committed in source control) goes
through a complex process on its way to being released. This process involves
building the software in a reliable and repeatable manner, as well as
progressing the built software (called a "build") through multiple stages of
testing and deployment.

Pipeline provides an extensible set of tools for modeling simple-to-complex
delivery pipelines "as code" via the
link:syntax[Pipeline domain-specific language (DSL) syntax].
footnoteref:[dsl,link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language[Domain-specific language]]

The definition of a Jenkins Pipeline is written into a text file (called a
link:jenkinsfile[`Jenkinsfile`]) which in turn can be committed to a project's
source control repository.
footnoteref:[scm,link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control[Source control management]]
This is the foundation of "Pipeline-as-code"; treating the CD pipeline a part of
the application to be versioned and reviewed like any other code.

Creating a `Jenkinsfile` and committing it to source control provides a number
of immediate benefits:

* Automatically creates a Pipeline build process for all branches and pull
  requests.
* Code review/iteration on the Pipeline (along with the remaining source code).
* Audit trail for the Pipeline.
* Single source of truth
  footnote:[link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth[Single source of truth]]
  for the Pipeline, which can be viewed and edited by multiple
  members of the project.

While the syntax for defining a Pipeline, either in the web UI or with a
`Jenkinsfile` is the same, it is generally considered best practice to define
the Pipeline in a `Jenkinsfile` and check that in to source control.


=== Declarative versus Scripted Pipeline syntax

A `Jenkinsfile` can be written using two types of syntax - Declarative and
Scripted.

Declarative and Scripted Pipelines are constructed fundamentally differently.
Declarative Pipeline is a more recent feature of Jenkins Pipeline which:

* provides richer syntactical features over Scripted Pipeline syntax, and
* is designed to make writing and reading Pipeline code easier.

Many of the individual syntactical components (or "steps") written into a
`Jenkinsfile`, however, are common to both Declarative and Scripted Pipeline.
Read more about how these two types of syntax differ in <<pipeline-concepts>>
and <<pipeline-syntax-overview>> below.


[[why]]
== Why Pipeline?

Jenkins is, fundamentally, an automation engine which supports a number of
automation patterns. Pipeline adds a powerful set of automation tools onto
Jenkins, supporting use cases that span from simple continuous integration to
comprehensive CD pipelines. By modeling a series of related tasks, users can
take advantage of the many features of Pipeline:

* *Code*: Pipelines are implemented in code and typically checked into source
  control, giving teams the ability to edit, review, and iterate upon their
  delivery pipeline.
* *Durable*: Pipelines can survive both planned and unplanned restarts of the
  Jenkins master.
* *Pausable*: Pipelines can optionally stop and wait for human input or approval
  before continuing the Pipeline run.
* *Versatile*: Pipelines support complex real-world CD requirements, including
  the ability to fork/join, loop, and perform work in parallel.
* *Extensible*: The Pipeline plugin supports custom extensions to its DSL
  footnoteref:[dsl] and multiple options for integration with other plugins.

While Jenkins has always allowed rudimentary forms of chaining Freestyle Jobs
together to perform sequential tasks,
footnote:[Additional plugins have been used to implement complex behaviors
utilizing Freestyle Jobs such as the Copy Artifact, Parameterized Trigger, and
Promoted Builds plugins] Pipeline makes this concept a first-class citizen in
Jenkins.

Building on the core Jenkins value of extensibility, Pipeline is also extensible
both by users with link:shared-libraries[Pipeline Shared Libraries] and by
plugin developers.

== Pipeline concepts

The following concepts are key aspects of Jenkins Pipeline, which tie in closely
to Pipeline syntax (see the link:#pipeline-syntax-overview[overview] below).


=== Pipeline

A Pipeline is a user-defined model of a CD pipeline. A Pipeline's code defines
your entire build process, which typically includes stages for building an
application, testing it and then delivering it.

Also, a `pipeline` block is a
link:#declarative-pipeline-fundamentals[key part of Declarative Pipeline syntax].


=== Node

A node is a machine which is part of the Jenkins environment and is capable of
executing a Pipeline.

Also, a `node` block is a
link:#scripted-pipeline-fundamentals[key part of Scripted Pipeline syntax].


=== Stage

A `stage` block defines a conceptually distinct subset of tasks performed
through the entire Pipeline (e.g. "Build", "Test" and "Deploy" stages),
which is used by many plugins to visualize or present Jenkins Pipeline
status/progress.
footnoteref:[blueocean,link:../blueocean[Blue Ocean],
plugin:pipeline-stage-view[Pipeline: Stage View plugin]]


=== Step

A single task. Fundamentally, a step tells Jenkins _what_ to do at a
particular point in time (or "step" in the process). For example, to execute
the shell command `make` use the `sh` step: `sh 'make'`. When a plugin
extends the Pipeline DSL, footnoteref:[dsl] that typically means the plugin has
implemented a new _step_.


== Pipeline syntax overview

The following Pipeline code skeletons illustrate the fundamental differences
between link:#declarative-pipeline-fundamentals[Declarative Pipeline syntax] and
link:#scripted-pipeline-fundamentals[Scripted Pipeline syntax].

Be aware that both link:#stage[stages] and link:#step[steps] (above) are common
elements of both Declarative and Scripted Pipeline syntax.


=== Declarative Pipeline fundamentals

In Declarative Pipeline syntax, the `pipeline` block defines all the work done
throughout your entire Pipeline.

[pipeline]
----
// Declarative //
pipeline {
    agent any // <1>
    stages {
        stage('Build') { // <2>
            steps {
                // // <3>
            }
        }
        stage('Test') { // <4>
            steps {
                // // <5>
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') { // <6>
            steps {
                // // <7>
            }
        }
    }
}
// Script //
----
<1> Execute this Pipeline or any of its stages, on any available agent.
<2> Defines the "Build" stage.
<3> Perform some steps related to the "Build" stage.
<4> Defines the "Test" stage.
<5> Perform some steps related to the "Test" stage.
<6> Defines the "Deploy" stage.
<7> Perform some steps related to the "Deploy" stage.


=== Scripted Pipeline fundamentals

In Scripted Pipeline syntax, one or more `node` blocks do the core work
throughout the entire Pipeline. Although this is not a mandatory requirement of
Scripted Pipeline syntax, confining your Pipeline's work inside of a `node`
block does two things:

. Schedules the steps contained within the block to run by adding an item
  to the Jenkins queue. As soon as an executor is free on a node, the
  steps will run.
. Creates a workspace (a directory specific to that particular
  Pipeline) where work can be done on files checked out from source control. +
  *Caution:* Depending on your Jenkins configuration, some workspaces may
  not get automatically cleaned up after a period of inactivity. See tickets
  and discussion linked from
  https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-2111[JENKINS-2111] for more
  information.

[pipeline]
----
// Declarative //
// Script //
node {  // <1>
    stage('Build') { // <2>
        // // <3>
    }
    stage('Test') { // <4>
        // // <5>
    }
    stage('Deploy') { // <6>
        // // <7>
    }
}
----
<1> Execute this Pipeline or any of its stages, on any available agent.
<2> Defines the "Build" stage. `stage` blocks are optional in Scripted Pipeline
syntax. However, implementing `stage` blocks in a Scripted Pipeline provides
clearer visualization of each `stage`'s subset of tasks/steps in the Jenkins UI.
<3> Perform some steps related to the "Build" stage.
<4> Defines the "Test" stage.
<5> Perform some steps related to the "Test" stage.
<6> Defines the "Deploy" stage.
<7> Perform some steps related to the "Deploy" stage.


== Pipeline example

Here is an example of a `Jenkinsfile` using Declarative Pipeline syntax - its
Scripted syntax equivalent can be accessed by clicking the *Toggle Scripted
Pipeline* link below:

[pipeline]
----
// Declarative //
pipeline { // <1>
    agent any // <2>
    options {
        skipStagesAfterUnstable()
    }
    stages {
        stage('Build') { // <3>
            steps { // <4>
                sh 'make' // <5>
            }
        }
        stage('Test'){
            steps {
                sh 'make check'
                junit 'reports/**/*.xml' // <6>
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'make publish'
            }
        }
    }
}
// Script //
node { // <7>
    stage('Build') { // <3>
        sh 'make' // <5>
    }
    stage('Test') {
        sh 'make check'
        junit 'reports/**/*.xml' // <6>
    }
    if (currentBuild.currentResult == 'SUCCESS') {
        stage('Deploy') {
            sh 'make publish'
        }
    }
}
----
<1> link:syntax#declarative-pipeline[`pipeline`] is Declarative
Pipeline-specific syntax that defines a "block" containing all content and
instructions for executing the entire Pipeline.
<2> link:syntax#agent[`agent`] is Declarative Pipeline-specific syntax that
instructs Jenkins to allocate an executor (on a node) and workspace for the
entire Pipeline.
<3> `stage` is a syntax block that describes a
link:#stage[stage of this Pipeline]. Read more about `stage` blocks in
Declarative Pipeline syntax on the link:syntax#stage[Pipeline syntax] page. As
mentioned link:#scripted-pipeline-fundamentals[above], `stage` blocks are
optional in Scripted Pipeline syntax.
<4> link:syntax#steps[`steps`] is Declarative Pipeline-specific syntax that
describes the steps to be run in this `stage`.
<5> `sh` is a Pipeline link:syntax#steps[step] (provided by the
plugin:workflow-durable-task-step[Pipeline: Nodes and Processes plugin]) that
executes the given shell command.
<6> `junit` is another a Pipeline link:syntax#steps[step] (provided by the
plugin:junit[JUnit plugin]) for aggregating test reports.
<7> `node` is Scripted Pipeline-specific syntax that instructs Jenkins to
execute this Pipeline (and any stages contained within it), on any available
agent/node. This is effectively equivalent to `agent` in Declarative
Pipeline-specific syntax.
