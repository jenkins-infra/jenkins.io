= Pipeline
This chapter will cover all aspects of the Jenkins Pipeline, from running pipeline jobs
to writing your own pipeline code.

This chapter is intended to be used by Jenkins users of all skill levels,
but beginners may need to refer to some sections of "<<using#,Using Jenkins>>"
to understand some topics covered in this chapter.

The sections are ordered from simpler to progressively more complex subjects.
The earlier sections are intended for those new to pipeline or unfamiliar with its
latest features.  The later sections with discuss expert-level considerations
and corner-cases.

If you are not yet familiar with basic Jenkins terminology and features, start with
<<getting-started#,Getting Started with Jenkins>>.

If you are already familiar with Jenkins basics and would like to delve deeper
into generally how to use various features, see
<<using#,Using Jenkins>>.

If you are a Jenkins administrator and want to know more about managing Jenkins nodes and instances, see
<<managing#,Managing Jenkins>>.

If you are a system administrator and want learn how to back-up, restore, maintain as Jenkins servers and nodes, see
<<operating#,Operating Jenkins>>.


[WARNING]
====
*To Contributors*:
This chapter functions as a continuation of "<<getting-started#,Getting Started with Jenkins>>"
and "<<using#,Using Jenkins>>", but the format will be slightly different - see the description above.
The first sections should lead users through the basics of pipeline, and later sections can switch to
feature reference for experienced users. All sections should still
be written and ordered to only assume knowledge from "Getting Started", "Using Jenkins", or
from previous sections in this chapter.
