This chapter will cover all aspects of Jenkins Pipeline, from running Pipelines
to writing Pipeline code, and even extending Pipeline itself.

For an overview of content in the Jenkins User Handbook, see
<<getting-started#,User Handbook Overview>>.

[[overview]]
== What is Jenkins Pipeline?

Jenkins Pipeline (or simply "Pipeline" with a capital "P") is a suite of plugins
which supports implementing and integrating _continuous delivery pipelines_ into
Jenkins.

A _continuous delivery pipeline_ is an automated expression of your process for
getting software from version control right through to your users and customers.
Every change to your software (committed in source control) goes through a
complex process on its way to being released. This process involves building the
software in a reliable and repeatable manner, as well as the progression of the
built software (called a "build") through multiple stages of testing and
deployment.

Pipeline provides an extensible set of tools for modeling simple-to-complex
delivery pipelines "as code" via the <<pipeline/syntax#,Pipeline Domain-specific
language (DSL) syntax>>.
footnoteref:[dsl,link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language[Domain-specific
language]]

Typically, the definition of a Jenkins Pipeline is written into a text file
(called a link:jenkinsfile[`Jenkinsfile`]) which in turn is checked into a
project's source control repository.
footnoteref:[scm,link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_control_management[Source
control management]] This is the foundation of "Pipeline-as-Code"; treating the
continuous delivery pipeline a part of the application to be versioned and
reviewed like any other code. Creating a `Jenkinsfile` provides a number of
immediate benefits:

* Automatically create Pipelines for all Branches and Pull Requests
* Code review/iteration on the Pipeline
* Audit trail for the Pipeline
* Single source of truth
  footnote:[link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth[Single
  source of truth]] for the Pipeline, which can be viewed and edited by multiple
  members of the project.

While the syntax for defining a Pipeline, either in the web UI or with a
`Jenkinsfile`, is the same, it's generally considered best practice to define
the Pipeline in a `Jenkinsfile` and check that in to source control.

Here's an example of a `Jenkinsfile`:

[pipeline]
----
// Declarative //
pipeline {
    agent any // <1>

    stages {
        stage('Build') { // <2>
            steps { // <3>
                sh 'make' // <4>
            }
        }
        stage('Test'){
            steps {
                sh 'make check'
                junit 'reports/**/*.xml' // <5>
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh 'make publish'
            }
        }
    }
}
// Script //
node {
    stage('Build') {
        sh 'make'
    }

    stage('Test') {
        sh 'make check'
        junit 'reports/**/*.xml'
    }

    stage('Deploy') {
        sh 'make publish'
    }
}
----
<1> <<pipeline/syntax#agent,`agent`>> indicates that Jenkins should allocate an
executor and workspace for this part of the Pipeline.
<2> <<pipeline/syntax#stage,`stage`>> describes a stage of this Pipeline.
<3> <<pipeline/syntax#steps, `steps`>> describes the steps to be run in this
`stage`
<4> `sh` executes the given shell command
<5> `junit` is a Pipeline <<pipeline/syntax#steps,step>> provided by the
plugin:junit[JUnit plugin] for aggregating test reports.

[[why]]
== Why Pipeline?

Jenkins is, fundamentally, an automation engine which supports a number of
automation patterns. Pipeline adds a powerful set of automation tools onto
Jenkins, supporting use cases that span from simple continuous integration to
comprehensive continuous delivery pipelines. By modeling a series of related
tasks, users can take advantage of the many features of Pipeline:

* *Code*: Pipelines are implemented in code and typically checked into source
  control, giving teams the ability to edit, review, and iterate upon their
  delivery pipeline.
* *Durable*: Pipelines can survive both planned and unplanned restarts of the
  Jenkins master.
* *Pausable*: Pipelines can optionally stop and wait for human input or approval
  before continuing the Pipeline run.
* *Versatile*: Pipelines support complex real-world continuous delivery
  requirements, including the ability to fork/join, loop, and perform work in
  parallel.
* *Extensible*: The Pipeline plugin supports custom extensions to its DSL
  footnoteref:[dsl] and multiple options for integration with other plugins.


While Jenkins has always allowed rudimentary forms of chaining Freestyle Jobs
together to perform sequential tasks
footnote:[Additional plugins have been used to implement complex behaviors
utilizing Freestyle Jobs such as the Copy Artifact, Parameterized Trigger, and
Promoted Builds plugins], Pipeline makes this concept a first-class citizen in
Jenkins.

Building on the core Jenkins value of extensibility, Pipeline is also extensible
both by users with <<pipeline/shared-libraries#,Pipeline Shared Libraries>> and
by plugin developers.

[[terms]]
== Pipeline Terms

[[step]]
Step::
    A single task; fundamentally steps tell Jenkins _what_ to do. For example,
    to execute the shell command `make` use the `sh` step: `sh 'make'`.
    When a plugin extends the Pipeline DSL, that typically means the plugin has
    implemented a new _step_.

[[node]]
Node::
    Most _work_ a Pipeline performs is done in the context of one or more
    declared `node` steps. Confining the work inside of a node step does two
    things:
    . Schedules the steps contained within the block to run by adding an item
      to the Jenkins queue. As soon as an executor is free on a node, the
      steps will run.
    . Creates a workspace (a directory specific to that particular
      Pipeline) where work can be done on files checked out from source control.

CAUTION: Depending on your Jenkins configuration, some workspaces may not get
automatically cleaned up after a period of inactivity. See tickets and
discussion linked from
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-2111[JENKINS-2111]
for more information.

[[stage]]
Stage::
    `stage` is a step for defining a conceptually distinct subset of the
    entire Pipeline, for example: "Build", "Test", and "Deploy", which is used by many
    plugins to visualize or present Jenkins Pipeline status/progress.
