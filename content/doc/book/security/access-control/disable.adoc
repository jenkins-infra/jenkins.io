title: Disable Access Control
layout: documentation

:toc:

Administrators may accidentally set up a security realm or authorization strategy in such a way that they are no longer able to administer or even access Jenkins.

When this happens, there are ways to reset the access control configuration to allow anyone to administer Jenkins.
The exact steps to do this depend on how you manage the Jenkins configuration.
The sections below explain how to disable access control in multiple different ways.

[WARNING]
====
After applying the advice below, Jenkins will be in an entirely unsecured mode after it starts, allowing anyone full access.
If you are able to, consider making Jenkins accessible only by you while the configuration is being reset.

One way to do this is to make sure that Jenkins is only accessible from the server it is running on.
If Jenkins is run using the built-in Winstone/Jetty container, set the `--httpListenAddress` or `--httpsListenAddress` (depending on whether you previously set up HTTPS in Winstone/Jetty) to `127.0.0.1`.
Where to change this depends on how you installed Jenkins.
Look up the documentation for your package or installer.
====

== Using `config.xml`

Use these instructions if your Jenkins configuration is _not_ managed using Configuration as Code plugin or link:/doc/book/managing/groovy-hook-scripts/[Groovy Init Hooks].

[NOTE]
The following steps will delete the configuration for security realm and authorization strategy.
Make sure you have a backup, to be able to restore the configuration to as close to the original state (except one where youâ€™re not locked out) as possible.

. Stop Jenkins.
. Go to the Jenkins home directory.
. Open the file `config.xml` in this directory in a text editor.
  Make sure you use an editor that supports Unix line breaks.
. Look for the `<useSecurity>true</useSecurity>` element in this file.
. Look for the elements `<securityRealm>` and `<authorizationStrategy>` and remove them.
  Either may span multiple lines, delete everything up to and including `</securityRealm>` and `</authorizationStrategy>`, respectively.
. Replace `true` with `false`.
. Start Jenkins.

// db: Pretty certain this is unnecessary advice unless proven to be necessary: If this is still not working, trying renaming or deleting `config.xml`.

== Using Configuration as Code

If you configure Jenkins using plugin:configuration-as-code[Configuration as Code Plugin] (JCasC), choose this approach.

Locate your JCasC configuration file.
The default location is `jenkins.yaml` in the Jenkins home directory, but it can be located in a number of places.
Review the https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin/blob/master/README.md[Jenkins Configuration as Code plugin documentation for details].

Once you have located the file:

1. Modify the `authorizationStrategy` directive in the `jenkins` section so that it configures the _Anyone can do anything_ authorization strategy:
+
[source, yaml]
----
jenkins:
  authorizationStrategy: unsecured
----
+
2. Restart your Jenkins instance to re-apply the modified configuration.

TODO Review this advice -- it doesn't seem to make sense unless something deletes all previously applied documentation?

=== Using a Groovy Script

If you are using a Groovy Script or a link:/doc/book/managing/groovy-hook-scripts/[Groovy Init Hook] to configure your authorization strategy,
you should locate the script setting is up.
There are multiple ways where it could be set, but essentially you should find a line like `Jenkins.instance.authorizationStrategy = myStrategy` or `setAuthorizationStrategy(myStrategy)`.

Once you have located the configuration:

* Comment out the line setting up the strategy.
* Restart your instance.
