= Securing Jenkins

Securing Jenkins has two aspects to it.

* Access control, which ensures users are authenticated when accessing Jenkins
  and their activities are authorized.
* Protecting Jenkins against external threats

== Access Control

You should lock down the access to Jenkins UI so that users are authenticated
and appropriate set of permissions are given to them. This setting is
controlled mainly by two axes:

* *Security Realm*, which determines users and their passwords, as well as what
  groups the users belong to.
* *Authorization Strategy*, which determines who has access to what.

These two axes are orthogonal, and need to be individually configured. For
example, you might choose to use external LDAP or Active Directory as the
security realm, and you might choose "everyone full access once logged in" mode
for authorization strategy. Or you might choose to let Jenkins run its own user
database, and perform access control based on the permission/user matrix.

* https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Apache+frontend+for+security[Apache frontend for security] --- run Jenkins behind Apache and perform access control in Apache instead of Jenkins
* https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Authenticating+scripted+clients[Authenticating scripted clients] --- if you need to programmatically access security-enabled Jenkins web UI, use BASIC auth

In addition to access control of users, link:../build-authorization[access control for builds] limits what builds can do, once started.
