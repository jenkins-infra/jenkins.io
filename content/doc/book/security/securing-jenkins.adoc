= Securing Jenkins

Securing Jenkins has two aspects to it.

* Access control, which ensures users are authenticated when accessing Jenkins
  and their activities are authorized.
* Protecting Jenkins against external threats

== Access Control

You should lock down the access to Jenkins UI so that users are authenticated
and appropriate set of permissions are given to them. This setting is
controlled mainly by two axes:

* *Security Realm*, which determines users and their passwords, as well as what
  groups the users belong to.
* *Authorization Strategy*, which determines who has access to what.

These two axes are orthogonal, and need to be individually configured. For
example, you might choose to use external LDAP or Active Directory as the
security realm, and you might choose "everyone full access once logged in" mode
for authorization strategy. Or you might choose to let Jenkins run its own user
database, and perform access control based on the permission/user matrix.

* https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Standard+Security+Setup[Standard Security Setup] --- discusses the most common setup of letting Jenkins run its own user database and do finer-grained access control
* https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Apache+frontend+for+security[Apache frontend for security] --- run Jenkins behind Apache and perform access control in Apache instead of Jenkins
* https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Authenticating+scripted+clients[Authenticating scripted clients] --- if you need to programmatically access security-enabled Jenkins web UI, use BASIC auth

In addition to access control of users, link:build-authorization[access control for builds] limits what builds can do, once started.

== Protect users of Jenkins from other threats

There are additional security subsystems in Jenkins that protect Jenkins and
users of Jenkins from indirect attacks.

The following topics discuss features that are *off by default*.
We recommend you read them first and act on them immediately.

* https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Security+implication+of+building+on+master[Security implication of building on controller] --- protect Jenkins controller from malicious builds
* https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Securing+JENKINS_HOME[Securing JENKINS_HOME] --- protect Jenkins from users with local access
* link:/doc/book/security/environment-variables[Handling Environment Variables] -- ensure that environment variables passed to build steps do not have unintended side effects

The following topics discuss other security features that are on by default. You'll only need to look at them when they are causing problems.

* link:/doc/book/security/csrf-protection[CSRF Protection] --- prevent a remote attack against Jenkins running inside your firewall.
* link:/doc/book/security/controller-isolation/#agent-controller-access-control[Agent To Controller Access] --- protect Jenkins controller from malicious build agents
* link:/doc/book/security/configuring-content-security-policy/[Configuring Content Security Policy] --- protect users of Jenkins from malicious builds
* link:/doc/book/security/markup-formatter/[Markup Formatter] -- allow for rich formatting of descriptions in Jenkins while keeping users safe
