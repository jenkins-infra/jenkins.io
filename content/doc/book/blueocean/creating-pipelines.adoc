= Creating a Pipeline

Blue Ocean makes it easy to create a Pipeline project in Jenkins.

A Pipeline can be generated from an existing `Jenkinsfile` in source control, or
you can use the link:../pipeline-editor[Blue Ocean Pipeline editor] to create a
new Pipeline for you (as a `Jenkinsfile` that will be committed to source
control).


== Setting up your Pipeline project

To start setting up your Pipeline project in Blue Ocean, at the top-right of the
link:../dashboard[Blue Ocean Dashboard], click the *New Pipeline* button.

If your Jenkins instance is new or has no Pipeline projects or other items
configured (and the Dashboard is empty), Blue Ocean displays a *Welcome to
Jenkins* message box on which you can click the *Create a new Pipeline* button
to start setting up your Pipeline project.

[.boxshadow]
image:blueocean/creating-pipelines/create-a-new-pipeline-box.png['Welcome to Jenkins - Create a New Pipeline message box',width=50%]

You now have a choice of creating your new Pipeline project from a:

* link:#for-a-git-repository[standard Git repository]
* link:#for-a-repository-on-github[repository on GitHub] or GitHub Enterprise
* link:#for-a-repository-on-bitbucket-cloud[repository on Bitbucket Cloud] or
  Bitbucket Server


=== For a Git repository

To create your Pipeline project for a Git repository, click the *Git* button
under *Where do you store your code?*

[.boxshadow]
image:blueocean/creating-pipelines/where-do-you-store-your-code.png['Where do
you store your code',width=70%]

In the *Connect to a Git repository* section, enter the URL for your Git
repository in the *Repository URL* field.

[.boxshadow]
image:blueocean/creating-pipelines/connect-to-a-git-repository.png['Connect to a
Git repository',width=70%]

You now need to specify a link:#local-repository[local] or a
link:#remote-repository[remote] repository from which to build your Pipeline
project.


==== Local repository

If your URL is a local directory path (e.g. beginning with a forward slash `/`
such as `/home/cloned-git-repos/my-git-repo.git`), you can proceed to click the
*Create Pipeline* button.

Blue Ocean will then scan your local repository's branches for a `Jenkinsfile`
and will commence a Pipeline run for each branch containing a `Jenkinsfile`. If
Blue Ocean cannot find any `Jenkinsfile`, you will be prompted to begin creating
one through the <<pipeline-editor#,Pipeline editor>>.

Local repositories are typically limited to file system access. They are usually
only visible from the master node.  Local repositories are also known
to require more complicated path names on Windows computers than most
users want to manage.  Users are advised to run jobs on agents rather
than running them directly on the master.  For those reasons, use a
remote repository rather than a local repository for the best Blue
Ocean experience.

==== Remote repository

Since the Pipeline editor saves edited Pipelines to Git repositories as
``Jenkinsfile``s, Blue Ocean only supports connections to remote Git
repositories over the SSH protocol.

If your URL is for a remote Git repository, then as soon as you begin typing
the URL, starting with either:

* `ssh://` - e.g.
  `ssh://gituser@git-server-url/git-server-repos-group/my-git-repo.git` +
  or
* `user@host:path/to/git/repo.git` - e.g.
  `gituser@git-server-url:git-server-repos-group/my-git-repo.git`,

Blue Ocean automatically generates an SSH public/private key pair (or presents
you with an existing one) for your current/logged in Jenkins user. This
credential is automatically registered in Jenkins with the following details for
this Jenkins user:

* *Domain*: `blueocean-private-key-domain`
* *ID*: `jenkins-generated-ssh-key`
* *Name*: `<jenkins-username> (jenkins-generated-ssh-key)`

You need to ensure that this SSH public/private key pair has been registered
with your Git server before continuing. If you have not already done this,
follow these 2 steps. Otherwise, link:#continuing-on[continue on].

. Configure the SSH public key component of this key pair (which you can copy
  and paste from the Blue Ocean interface) for the remote Git server's user
  account (e.g. within the `authorized_keys` file of the machine's
  `gituser/.ssh` directory). +
  [[continuing-on]]
  *Note:* This process allows your Jenkins user to access the repositories that
  your Git server's user account (e.g. `gituser`) has access to. Read more about
  this in
  link:https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Setting-Up-the-Server[Setting Up the Server]
  of the link:https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/[Pro Git documentation].
. When done, return to the Blue Ocean interface.

Click the *Create Pipeline* button.

Blue Ocean will then scan your local repository's branches for a `Jenkinsfile`
and will commence a Pipeline run for each branch containing a `Jenkinsfile`. If
Blue Ocean cannot find any `Jenkinsfile`, you will be prompted to begin creating
one through the link:../pipeline-editor[Pipeline editor].


=== For a repository on GitHub

To create your Pipeline project directly for a repository on GitHub, click the
*GitHub* button under *Where do you store your code?*

[.boxshadow]
image:blueocean/creating-pipelines/where-do-you-store-your-code.png['Where do
you store your code',width=70%]

In the *Connect to GitHub* section, enter your GitHub access token into the
*Your GitHub access token* field. +
If you previously configured Blue Ocean to connect to GitHub using a personal
access token, Blue Ocean takes you directly to the
link:#choose-your-github-account-organization-and-repository[choosing your GitHub account/organization and repository]
steps below.

[.boxshadow]
image:blueocean/creating-pipelines/connect-to-github.png['Connect to
GitHub',width=70%]

If you do not have a GitHub access token, click the *Create an access key here*
link to open GitHub to the
*link:#create-your-access-token[New personal access token]* page.


==== Create your access token

. In the new tab, sign in to your GitHub account (if necessary) and on the
  GitHub *New Personal Access Token* page, specify a brief *Token description*
  for your GitHub access token (e.g. `Blue Ocean`). +
  *Note:* An access token is usually an alphanumeric string that respresents
  your GitHub account along with permissions to access various GitHub features
  and areas through your GitHub account. The new access token process (triggered
  through the *Create an access key here* link above) has the appropriate
  permissions pre-selected, which Blue Ocean requires to access and interact
  with your GitHub account.
. Scroll down to the end of the page and click *Generate token*.
. On the resulting *Personal access tokens* page, copy your newly generated
  access token.
. Back in Blue Ocean, paste the access token into the *Your GitHub access token*
  field and click *Connect*. +
  Your current/logged in Jenkins user now has access to your GitHub account
  (provided by your access token), so you can now
  <<choose-your-github-account-organization-and-repository,choose your GitHub account/organization and repository>>. +
  Jenkins registers this credential with the following details
  for this Jenkins user:
* *Domain*: `blueocean-github-domain`
* *ID*: `github`
* *Name*: `+<jenkins-username>/****** (GitHub Access Token)+`

[[choose-your-github-account-organization-and-repository]]
==== Choose your GitHub account/organization and repository

At this point, Blue Ocean prompts you to choose your GitHub account or an
organization you are a member of, as well as the repository it contains from
which to build your Pipeline project.

. In the *Which organization does the repository belong to?* section, click
  either:
* Your GitHub account to create a Pipeline project for one of your own GitHub
  repositories or one which you have forked from elsewhere on GitHub.
* An organization you are a member of to create a Pipeline project for a GitHub
  repository located within this organization.
. In the *Choose a repository* section, click the repository (within your GitHub
  account or organization) from which to build your Pipeline project. +
  *Tip:* If your list of repositories is long, you can filter this list using
  the *Search* option.
[.boxshadow]
image:blueocean/creating-pipelines/choose-a-repository.png['Choose a
repository',width=70%]
. Click *Create Pipeline*. +
  Blue Ocean will then scan your local repository's branches for a `Jenkinsfile`
  and will commence a Pipeline run for each branch containing a `Jenkinsfile`.
  If Blue Ocean cannot find any `Jenkinsfile`, you will be prompted to begin
  creating one through the link:../pipeline-editor[Pipeline editor] (by clicking
  *Create Pipeline* again). +
  *Note:* Under the hood, a Pipeline project created through Blue Ocean is
  actually "multibranch Pipeline". Therefore, Jenkins looks for the presence of
  at least one Jenkinsfile in any branch of your repository.

=== For a repository on Bitbucket Cloud

To create your Pipeline project directly for a Git or Mercurial repository on
Bitbucket Cloud, click the *Bitbucket Cloud* button under *Where do you store
your code?*

[.boxshadow]
image:blueocean/creating-pipelines/where-do-you-store-your-code.png['Where do
you store your code',width=70%]

In the *Connect to Bitbucket* section, enter your Bitbucket email address and
password into the *Username* and *Password* fields, respectively. Note that:

* If you previously configured Blue Ocean to connect to Bitbucket with your
  email address and password, Blue Ocean takes you directly to the
  link:#choose-your-bitbucket-account-team-and-repository[choosing your Bitbucket account/team and repository]
  steps below.
* If you entered these credentials, Jenkins registers them with the following
  details for this Jenkins user:
** *Domain*: `blueocean-bitbucket-cloud-domain`
** *ID*: `bitbucket-cloud`
** *Name*: `+<bitbucket-user@email.address>/****** (Bitbucket server credentials)+`

[.boxshadow]
image:blueocean/creating-pipelines/connect-to-bitbucket.png['Connect to
Bitbucket',width=70%]

Click *Connect* and your current/logged in Jenkins user will now have access to
your Bitbucket account. You can now
<<choose-your-bitbucket-account-team-and-repository,choose your Bitbucket
account/team and repository>>.


==== Choose your Bitbucket account/team and repository

At this point, Blue Ocean prompts you to choose your Bitbucket account or a team
you are a member of, as well as the repository it contains from which to build
your Pipeline project.

. In the *Which team does the repository belong to?* section, click either:
* Your Bitbucket account to create a Pipeline project for one of your own
  Bitbucket repositories or one which you have forked from elsewhere on
  Bitbucket.
* A team you are a member of to create a Pipeline project for a Bitbucket
  repository located within this team.
. In the *Choose a repository* section, click the repository (within your
  Bitbucket account or team) from which to build your Pipeline project. +
  *Tip:* If your list of repositories is long, you can filter this list using
  the *Search* option.
[.boxshadow]
image:blueocean/creating-pipelines/choose-a-repository.png['Choose a
repository',width=70%]
. Click *Create Pipeline*. +
  Blue Ocean will then scan your local repository's branches for a `Jenkinsfile`
  and will commence a Pipeline run for each branch containing a `Jenkinsfile`.
  If Blue Ocean cannot find any `Jenkinsfile`, you will be prompted to begin
  creating one through the link:../pipeline-editor[Pipeline editor] (by clicking
  *Create Pipeline* again). +
  *Note:* Under the hood, a Pipeline project created through Blue Ocean is
  actually "multibranch Pipeline". Therefore, Jenkins looks for the presence of
  at least one Jenkinsfile in any branch of your repository.
