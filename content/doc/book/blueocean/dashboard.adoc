= Dashboard

The Blue Ocean Dashboard shows an overview of all Pipelines on a Jenkins instance.
The Dashboard is the default view shown when you open Blue Ocean.
It consists of a Navigation bar at the top, a Favorites list, and a Pipelines list.

== Navigation Bar

The Dashboard includes the <<getting-started#navigation-bar, standard navigation bar>>
at the top, with a local navigation bar below that.
The local navigation bar includes only one button:

* *New Pipeline* - Open the <<creating-pipelines#, Pipeline Creation workflow>>

== Favorites

The "Favorites" list is displayed above the regular Pipelines list.
The "Favorites" list shows the <<pipeline-run-status, status>>
and other key details about the latest Run for branches or pull requests
that include items that are important to the current user.
Blue Ocean automatically adds branches or pull requests to this list
when a they contain a Run that has changes authored by the current user.
Users can also manually remove items from their favorites by clicking on
the solid star "&#9733;" in this list.

Clicking on an item in the Favorites list will bring up the
<<pipeline-run-details#, Pipeline Run Details>> for latest Run in that branch or pull request.

== Pipelines

The "Piplines" list shows the overall state of each Pipeline in this Jenkins instance,
including the <<pipeline-health, health>> of the pipeline,
counts of branches and pull requests that are passing or failing,
and a star (either solid "&#9733;" or outline "&#9734;")
indicating whether the default branch for this Pipeline has been manually added to this user's Favorites.
Clicking on the star will toggle whether the default branch for that Pipeline
is shown in the <<dashboard#favorites, "Favorites" list>> for this user.

Clicking on an item in the Pipelines list will bring up the
<<activity#, Pipeline Activity View>> for that Pipeline.

[[pipeline-health]]
=== Health Icons

Blue Ocean represents the overall health of a Pipeline or Pipeline branch using
weather icons, which change depending on the number of recent builds that have Passed.
Health icons on the <<dashboard#, Dashboard>> represent overall Pipeline health.
Health icons in the <<activity#branches, Branches tab of the Activity View>>
represent health for each branch.
