== Navigation Bar

The Dashboard includes the <<getting-started#navigation-bar, standard navigation bar>>
at the top, with it's local navigation bar below that.
The local navigation bar includes only one button:

* *New Pipeline* - Open the <<creating-pipelines, Pipeline Creation workflow>>

== Favorites

The "Favorites" list is displayed above the regular Pipelines list.
The "Favorites" list shows the status and key other details about the latest Run
for branches or pull requests that include items that are important to the current user.
Blue Ocean automatically adds branches or pull requests to this list when a they contain a
Run that has changes authored by the current user.
Users can also manually remove items from their favorites by clicking on the solid star in this list.

== Pipelines

The "Piplines" list show the overall health and status of each Pipeline in this Jenkins instance.
