= Dashboard

Blue Ocean's "Dashboard" is the default view shown when you open Blue Ocean and
shows an overview of all Pipeline projects configured on a Jenkins instance.

The Dashboard consists of a blue link:#navigation-bar[navigation bar] at the
top, the link:#pipelines-list[Pipelines list], as well as the
link:#favorites-list[Favorites list].

Dashboard,role=center,width=100%]


== Navigation bar

The Dashboard includes the blue-colored
link:../getting-started#navigation-bar[navigation bar] along the top of the
interface.

This bar is divided into two sections - a common section along the top and a
contextual section below. The contextual section changes depending on the
current Blue Ocean page you are viewing.

When viewing the Dashboard, the navigation bar's contextual section includes
the:

* *Search pipelines* field, to filter the link:#pipelines-list[Pipelines list]
  to show items containing the text you enter into this field.
* *New Pipeline* button, which begins the
  link:../creating-pipelines[create a Pipeline] process.


== Pipelines list

The "Pipelines" list is the Dashboard's default list and upon accessing Blue
Ocean for the first time, this is the only list shown on the Dashboard.

This list shows the overall state of each Pipeline configured on the Jenkins
instance (which can also include other Jenkins items). For a given item in this
list, the following information is indicated:

* The item's *NAME*,
* The item's link:#pipeline-health[*HEALTH*],
* The numbers of **BRANCH**es and pull requests (**PR**s) of the
  Pipeline's source control repository which are passing or failing, and
* A star indicating whether or not the default/main branch of the item has been
  manually added to your current Jenkins user's <<favorites-list>>.

Clicking on an item's star will toggle between:

* Adding the default branch of the item's repository to your current user's
  Favorites list (indicated by a solid "&#9733;"), and
* Removing the item's default branch from this list (indicated by an outlined
  "&#9734;").

Clicking on an item in the Pipelines list will display that item's
link:../activity[Activity View].


== Favorites list

The *Favorites* list appears above the Dashboard's default <<pipelines-list>>
when at least one Pipeline/item is present in your user's Favorites list.

This list provides key information and actions for a core subset of your user's
accessible items in the <<pipelines-list>>. This key information includes the
current link:#run-status[run status] for an item and its repository's branch, as
well as other details about the item's run, including the name of the branch,
the initial part of the commit hash and the time of the last run. Items in this
list also include clickable icons to run or re-run the item on the repository
branch indicated.

You should only add an item (or one of the repository's specific branches) to
your Favorites list if you need to examine that item's branch on a regular
basis. Adding an item's specific branch to your Favorites list can be done
through the item's link:../activity[Activity View].

Blue Ocean automatically adds branches or PRs to this list when a they contain a
run that has changes authored by the current user.

You can also manually remove items from your Favorites list by clicking on the
solid "&#9733;" in this list. When the last item is removed from this list, the
list is removed from the interface.

Clicking on an item in the Favorites list will open the
link:../pipeline-run-details[Pipeline run details] for latest run on the
repository branch or PR indicated.


[[pipeline-health]]
=== Health icons

Blue Ocean represents the overall health of a Pipeline/item or one of its
repository's branches using weather icons, which change depending on the number
of recent builds that have passed.

Health icons on the Dashboard represent overall Pipeline health, whereas the
health icons in the link:../activity#branches[Branches tab of the Activity View]
represent the overall health for each branch.
