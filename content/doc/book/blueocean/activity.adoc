= Activity View

The Blue Ocean Activity View shows the all activity related to one Pipeline.

== Navigation Bar

The Activity View includes the <<getting-started#navigation-bar, standard navigation bar>>
at the top, with a local navigation bar below that.
The local navigation bar includes:

* *Pipeline Name* - Clicking on this displays the
<<activity, default activity tab>>
* *Favorites Toggle* - Clicking the "Favorite" symbol (a star outline "&#9734;") adds a branch to the favorites list shown on the
<<dashboard#favorites, Dashboard's "Favorites" list>> for this user.
* *Tabs*
(<<activity, Activity>>, <<branches, Branches>>, <<pull-requests, Pull Requests>>) -
Clicking one of these will display that tab of the Activity View.

== Activity

The default tab of the Activity View, the "Activity" tab,
shows a list of the latest completed or in-progress Runs.
Each line in the list shows the <<dashboard#run-status, status>> of the Run,
id number, commit information, duration, and when the run completed.
Clicking on a Run will bring up the <<pipeline-run-details#, Pipeline Run Details>>
for that Run.
"In Progress" Runs can be aborted from this list by clicking on the "Stop" symbol
(a square "&#9724;" inside a circle).
Runs that have completed can be re-run by clicking the
"Re-run" symbol (a counter-clockwise arrow "&#8634;").
The list can be filtered by branch or pull request by clicking on the "branch"
drop-down in the list header.

This list does not allow runs to be edited or marked as favorites.
Those actions can be done from the "<<branches, branches>>" tab.

== Branches

The "Branches" tab shows a list of all branches that have a
completed or in-progress Run in the current Pipeline.
Each line in the list corresponds to a branch in source control,
footnote:scm[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_control_management]
showing
<<dashboard#pipeline-health, overall health of the branch>> based on recent runs,
status of the most recent run, id number, commit information, duration, and when the run completed.

Clicking on a branch in this list will bring up the
<<pipeline-run-details#, Pipeline Run Details>>
for the latest completed or in-progress Run of that branch.
"In Progress" runs can be aborted from this list by clicking on the "Stop" symbol
(a square "&#9724;" inside a circle).
Pull requests whose latest run has completed can be run again by clicking the
"Play" symbol (a triangle "&#9654;" inside a circle).
Clicking the "Edit" symbol (similar to a pencil "&#9998;") opens the
<<pipeline-editor#, pipeline editor>> on the Pipeline for that brach.
Clicking the "Favorite" symbol (a star outline "&#9734;") adds a branch to the favorites list shown on the
<<dashboard#favorites, Dashboard's "Favorites" list>> for this user.
A favorite branch will show a solid star "&#9733;" and clicking it removes
this branch from the favorites.

== Pull Requests

The "Pull Requests" tab shows a list of all
Pull Requests for the current Pipeline that have a completed or in-progress Run.
(Some source control systems call these "Merge Requests", others do not support them at all.)
Each line in the list corresponds to a pull request in source control, showing
the status of the most recent run, id number, commit information, duration, and when the run completed.

image:blueocean/activity/pull-requests.png[Activity Pull Requests view, role=center]

Blue Ocean displays pull requests separately from branches,
but otherwise the Pull Requests list behaves similar to the Branches list.
Clicking on a pull request in this list will bring up the
<<pipeline-run-details#, Pipeline Run Details>>
for the latest completed or in-progress Run of that pull request.
"In Progress" runs can be aborted from this list by clicking on the "Stop" symbol
(a square "&#9724;" inside a circle).
Pull requests whose latest run has completed can be run again by clicking the
"Play" symbol (a triangle "&#9654;" inside a circle).
Pull request do not display <<dashboard#pipeline-health, "Heath Icons">>
and cannot be edited or marked as favorites.

NOTE: By default, when a Pull Request is closed,
Jenkins will remove the Pipeline from Jenkins (to be cleaned up at a later date),
and runs for that Pull Request will not longer be accessible from Jenkins.
That can be changed by changing the configuration of the underlying Multi-branch Pipeline job.
