= Activity View

The Blue Ocean Activity view shows all activities related to one Pipeline.

include::doc/book/blueocean/_blue-ocean-status.adoc[]

== Navigation Bar

The Activity view includes the <<getting-started#navigation-bar, standard navigation bar>> at the top and a local navigation bar below that.

The local navigation bar includes:

* *Pipeline Name* - Selecting this displays the <<activity#, default Activity tab>>
* *Favorites Toggle* - Selecting the favorite icon &#9734; to the right of the Pipeline name, adds a branch to the favorites list shown on the <<dashboard#favorites, dashboard's favorites list>>.
* *Tabs* (<<activity, Activity>>, <<branches, Branches>> <<pull-requests, Pull Requests>>) - Selecting one of these will navigate to the corresponding information in the Activity view.

=== Activity

The default tab of the Activity view shows a list of the latest completed or in-progress runs.
Each line represents the <<dashboard#run-status, status>> of a run, run id, commit information, and when the run completed.

* Selecting a run will bring up the <<pipeline-run-details#, Pipeline run details>> to provide Pipeline visualization.
* In-progress runs can be aborted from this list by selecting the *stop* icon, which is represented by a &#9726; within a circle.
* Runs that have been completed can be re-run by selecting the
*re-run* icon &#8634;.
* The list can be filtered by branch using the "Branch" drop-down in the list header.

This view does not allow runs to be edited or marked as favorites.
To perform these actions, select the "<<branches, Branches>>" tab.

=== Branches

The Branches tab shows a list of all branches that have a completed or in-progress run in the current Pipeline.
Each line in the list corresponds to a branch in source control, showing <<dashboard#pipeline-health, overall health of the branch>> based on the status of the most recent run, branch name, commit information, and when the run completed.

Selecting a branch will bring up the <<pipeline-run-details#, Pipeline run details>> for the latest completed or in-progress run of that branch.

. Pipelines where the latest run has been completed can be run again by selecting the *run* icon, represented by a icon:play[] in a circle.
+
* In-progress runs can be aborted, and display a *stop* icon, which is represented by a &#9726; within a circle.
. Selecting the *history* icon icon:history[] will allow you to view the run history for that branch.
. The *edit* icon, represented by a icon:pencil[], opens the <<pipeline-editor#, pipeline editor>> for that branch.
. The *favorite* &#9734; icon adds a branch to your favorites list on the <<dashboard#favorites, dashboard>>.
On the dashboard a branch listed under favorites will show a solid star &#9733;.
Deselecting it removes this branch from the favorites list.

=== Pull Requests

The Pull Requests tab shows a list of all pull requests for the current Pipeline, that have a completed or in-progress run.
Each line in the list corresponds to a pull request in source control, which displays the status of the most recent run, run id, summary, author, and when the run completed.

Blue Ocean displays pull requests and branches in separate tabs, but the lists themselves behave similarly.
Selecting a pull request in this list will bring up the <<pipeline-run-details#, Pipeline run details>> for the latest completed or in-progress run of that pull request.

* In-progress runs can be aborted from this list by selecting the *stop* icon, which is represented by a &#9726; within a circle.
* Pull requests whose latest run has been completed can be run again by selecting the *run* icon, represented by a icon:play[] in a circle.

The pull request list does not display <<dashboard#pipeline-health, health icons>>, and pull requests cannot be edited or marked as favorites.

NOTE: By default, when a pull request is closed, Jenkins will remove the Pipeline from Jenkins, and runs for that pull request will no longer be accessible from Jenkins.
The Pipelines removed in this way will need to be cleaned up in the future.
This can be changed by adjusting the configuration of the underlying multi-branch Pipeline job.
