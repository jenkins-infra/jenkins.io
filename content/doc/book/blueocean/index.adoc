[[blue-ocean]]
= Blue Ocean

This chapter covers all aspects of Blue Ocean's functionality, including how to:

* link:getting-started[get started with Blue Ocean] - covers how to set up Blue
  Ocean in Jenkins and access the Blue Ocean interface,
* link:creating-pipelines[create a new Pipeline] project,
* use Blue Ocean's link:dashboard[Dashboard],
* use the link:activity[Activity view] - where you can access
  link:activity#activity[lists of your current and previously completed Pipeline/item runs],
  as well as your Pipeline project's link:activity#branches[branches] and any
  opened link:activity#pull-requests[Pull Requests],
* use the link:pipeline-run-details[Pipeline run details view] - where you can
  access details (i.e. the console output) for a particular Pipeline/item run,
  and
* use the link:pipeline-editor[Pipeline Editor] to modify Pipelines as code,
  which are committed to source control.

This chapter is intended for Jenkins users of all skill levels, but beginners
may need to refer to some sections of the <<pipeline#,Pipeline>> chapter to
understand some topics covered in this Blue Ocean chapter.

<<getting-started#,User Handbook overview>>.

== What is Blue Ocean?

Blue Ocean rethinks the user experience of Jenkins. Designed from the ground up
for link:../pipeline/[Jenkins Pipeline], but still compatible with freestyle jobs,
Blue Ocean reduces clutter and increases clarity for every member of the team.
Blue Ocean's main features include:

* *Sophisticated visualizations* of continuous delivery (CD) Pipelines,
  allowing for fast and intuitive comprehension of your Pipeline's status.
* *Pipeline editor* - makes creation of Pipelines approachable by guiding the
  user through an intuitive and visual process to create a Pipeline.
* *Personalization* to suit the role-based needs of each member of the team.
* *Pinpoint precision* when intervention is needed and/or issues arise. Blue
  Ocean shows where in the pipeline attention is needed, facilitating exception
  handling and increasing productivity.
* *Native integration for branch and pull requests*, enables maximum developer
  productivity when collaborating on code with others in GitHub and Bitbucket.

To start using Blue Ocean, see
link:getting-started/[Getting started with Blue Ocean].

== Frequently asked questions


=== Why does Blue Ocean exist?

The world has moved on from developer tools that are purely functional to
developer tools being part of a "developer experience". That is to say, it is no
longer about a single tool but the many tools developers use throughout the day
and how they work together to achieve a workflow that is beneficial for the
developer - this is "developer experience".

Developer tools companies like Heroku, Atlassian and Github have raised the bar
for what is considered good developer experience, and developers are
increasingly expecting exceptional design. In recent years, developers have
become more rapidly attracted to tools that are not only functional but are
designed to fit into their workflow seamlessly and are a joy to use. This shift
represents a higher standard of design and user experience. Jenkins needs to
rise to meet this higher standard.

Creating and visualising CD pipelines is something valuable
for many Jenkins users and this is demonstrated in the 5+ plugins that the
Jenkins community has created to meet their needs. This indicates a need to
revisit how Jenkins currently expresses these concepts and consider delivery
pipelines as a central theme to the Jenkins user experience.

It is not just CD concepts but the tools that developers use
every day – Github, Bitbucket, Slack, HipChat, Puppet or Docker. It is about
more than Jenkins – it is the developer workflow which surrounds Jenkins that
spans multiple tools.

New teams have little time to learn how to assemble their own Jenkins
experience – they want to improve their time to market by shipping better
software faster. Assembling that ideal Jenkins experience is something we can
work together as a community of Jenkins users and contributors to define. As
time progresses, developers' expectations of good user experience changes and
the mission of Blue Ocean enables the Jenkins project to respond.

The Jenkins community has poured its sweat and tears into building the most
technically capable and extensible software automation tool in existence. Not
doing anything to revolutionize the Jenkins developer experience today is just
inviting someone else – in closed source – to do it.

=== Where is the name from?

The name Blue Ocean comes from the book
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Ocean_Strategy[Blue Ocean Strategy]
where instead of looking at strategic problems within a contested space, you
look at problems in the larger uncontested space. To put this more simply,
consider this quote from ice hockey legend Wayne Gretzky: "skate to where the
puck is going to be, not where it has been".


==== Does Blue Ocean support freestyle jobs?

Blue Ocean aims to deliver a great experience around Pipeline and be compatible
with any freestyle jobs you already have configured on your Jenkins instance.
However, you will not benefit from any of the features built for Pipelines – for
example, Pipeline visualization.

As Blue Ocean is designed to be extensible, it is possible for the Jenkins
community to extend Blue Ocean to support other job types in the future.


=== What does this mean for the Jenkins classic UI?

The intention is that as Blue Ocean matures, there will be fewer reasons for
users to go back to the existing "classic UI". Read more about the classic UI
in link:../pipeline/getting-started[Getting started with Pipeline].

For example, early versions of Blue Ocean are mainly targeted at Pipeline jobs.
You might be able to see your existing non-pipeline jobs in Blue Ocean but it
might not be possible to configure them from the Blue Ocean UI for some time.
This means users will have to jump back to the classic UI to configure
items/projects/jobs other than Pipeline ones.

There are likely going to be more examples of this, which is why the classic UI
will remain important in the long term.


=== What does this mean for my plugins?

Extensibility is a core feature of Jenkins. Therefore, being able to extend the
Blue Ocean UI is important. The +
`<ExtensionPoint name=..>` can be used in the markup of Blue Ocean, leaving
places for plugins to contribute to the Blue Ocean UI - i.e. plugins can have
their own Blue Ocean extension points, just like they can in the Jenkins classic
UI. So far, Blue Ocean itself is implemented using these extension points.

Extensions are delivered by plugins as usual. However, plugin developers will
need to include some additional JavaScript to hook into Blue Ocean's extension
points and contribute to the Blue Ocean user experience.


=== What technologies are currently in use?

Blue Ocean is built as a collection of Jenkins plugins itself. There is one key
difference - Blue Ocean provides both its own endpoint for HTTP requests and
delivers up HTML/JavaScript via a different path, without the existing Jenkins
UI markup/scripts. React.js and ES6 are used to deliver the JavaScript
components of Blue Ocean. Inspired by this excellent open source project
(read more about this in the
link:https://nylas.com/blog/react-plugins[Building Plugins for React Apps] blog
post), an `<ExtensionPoint>` pattern was established that allows extensions to
come from any Jenkins plugin (only with JavaScript) and should they fail to
load, have their failures isolated.


=== Where can I find the source code?

The source code can be found on Github:

* link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/blueocean-plugin[Blue Ocean]
* link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins-design-language[Jenkins Design Language]
