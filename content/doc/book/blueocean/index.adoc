[blue-ocean]
= Blue Ocean User Experience

This chapter will cover all aspects of Jenkins Blue Ocean, from view Pipelines
to writing Pipeline code, and even extending Pipeline itself.

This chapter is intended to be used by Jenkins users of all skill levels,
but beginners may need to refer to some sections of "<<using#,Using Jenkins>>"
to understand some topics covered in this chapter.

If you are not yet familiar with basic Jenkins terminology and features, start with
<<getting-started#,Getting Started with Jenkins>>.

[[overview]]
== What is Blue Ocean?

Blue Ocean is a new project that rethinks the user experience of Jenkins.
Designed from the ground up for Jenkins Pipeline and compatible with Freestyle
jobs, Blue Ocean reduces clutter and increases clarity for every member of your
team through the following key features:

* *Sophisticated visualizations* of CD pipelines, allowing for fast and intuitive comprehension of software pipeline status.
* *Pipeline editor* (In Development) that makes automating CD pipelines approachable by guiding the user through an intuitive and visual process to create a pipeline.
* *Personalization* of the Jenkins UI to suit the role-based needs of each member of the DevOps team.
* *Pinpoint precision* when intervention is needed and/or issues arise. The Blue Ocean UI shows where in the pipeline attention is needed, facilitating exception handling and increasing productivity.
* *Native integration for branch and pull requests* enables maximum developer productivity when collaborating on code with others in GitHub and Bitbucket.

Here is a quick tour of Blue Ocean.

=== Pipelines

Blue Ocean is built from the ground up for Pipeline and uses its related concepts as a
foundation to enable use cases that Jenkins hasn't handled before. The visualization
makes it easy to follow along the flow of your Pipeline and gives you clarity
into your Continuous Delivery processes.

We know many developers spend a lot of time staring at logs in Jenkins. That’s
why we’ve broken up the log broken up step by step to make it much simpler to navigate.
Gone are the days that we all spend scrolling through log files that are 10s of
thousands or 100s of thousands of lines long.

When you open the pipeline visualisation you can immediately identify what
problem that are causing the Pipeline to fail.

=== Personalized Dashboard

The Personalized Dashboard surfaces a single developer the things that they care
about so that they can work better with their team. It responds
preemptively to your activity showing you the status of Pipelines that you are
interested in.

If a developer favorites a Pipeline or one of its branches it will appear on the
dashboard. Pipelines needed the developers attention, such as failing Pipelines,
appear at the top of the dashboard.

And when the developer creates a branch in Git, Blue Ocean will automatically
favourite it for them. When the branch is deleted the Pipeline's branch is
removed from view.

=== Branches and Pull Requests

Blue Ocean uses Jenkins Pipeline to discover new branches with `Jenkinsfile`s and
 runs them for you so that you are testing your Pipeline with every new feature
 branch that you create.

If a developer opens a Pull Request against your repository, Jenkins will build it
using your Pipeline and update Github or Bitbucket with the status of the Pipeline.
This is extremely useful for reviewers of Pull Requests as successful Pipelines
improve confidence that changes will integrate without causing havoc.

=== Design Language

Jenkins is nothing without its ecosystem of 1000+ plugins and we believe it's
important that Blue Ocean brings them along for the ride. Most developers in
our community don't consider themselves hot shot frontend developers or
designers, that's why we are introducing a consistent design language and
accompanying JavaScript and CSS framework. If you're familiar with Google's
link:https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html[Material
Design], Twitter link:http://getbootstrap.com/[Bootstrap], Apple's
link:https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/[Human
Interface Guidelines] or Microsoft
link:https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh465424.aspx[Modern
UI] you will be right at home here.

For those curious about the technology stack here, we are working with a
combination of

and
link:https://medium.com/@tomastrajan/introduction-to-react-and-flux-6043d63610cd#.stjh5un3g[React]
which we believe will be provide a smooth learning experience for those strong
in Java skills but not so confident in CSS/JS.  React's component based way of
describing user interfaces also complements the way that Jenkins Extensibility
works. We've extended the plugin system and toolchain to work with React
components.

== Limitations

=== Freestyle jobs

Blue Ocean aims to deliver a great experience around Pipeline and be compatible
with any Freestyle jobs that you have configured in your system. However, they
won't be able to benefit from any of the features built for Pipelines – for
example, Pipeline visualization.

As Blue Ocean is designed to be extensible it will be possible for the
community to extend it for other job types in the future.


== FAQ

=== Why does Blue Ocean exist?

The world has moved on from developer tools that are purely functional to
developer tools being part of a "developer experience". That is to say, it's no
longer about a single tool but the many tools developers use throughout the day
and how they work together to achieve a workflow that's beneficial for the
developer - this is Developer Experience.

Developer tools companies like Heroku, Atlassian and Github have raised the bar
for what is considered good developer experience, and developers are
increasingly expecting exceptional design. In recent years developers are
becoming more rapidly attracted to tools that are not only functional but are
designed to fit into their workflow seamlessly and are a joy to use. This shift
represents a higher standard of design and user experience that Jenkins needs
to rise to meet.

Creating and visualising continuous delivery pipelines is something valuable
for many Jenkins users and this is demonstrated in the 5+ plugins that the
community has created to meet their needs. To us this indicates a need to
revisit how Jenkins currently expresses these concepts and consider delivery
pipelines as a central theme to the Jenkins user experience.

It's not just continuous delivery concepts but the tools that developers use
every day – Github, Bitbucket, Slack, HipChat, Puppet or Docker. It's about
more than Jenkins – it's the developer workflow that surrounds Jenkins that
spans multiple tools.

New teams have little time for learning to assemble their own Jenkins
experience – they want to improve their time to market by shipping better
software faster. Assembling that ideal Jenkins experience is something we can
work together as a community of Jenkins users and contributors to define. As
time progresses, developers' expectations of good user experience will change
and the mission of Blue Ocean will enable the Jenkins project to respond.

The Jenkins community has poured its sweat and tears into building the most
technically capable and extensible software automation tool in existence. Not
doing anything to revolutionize the Jenkins developer experience today is just
inviting someone else – in closed source – to do it.

=== Where is the name from?

The name Blue Ocean comes from the book
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Ocean_Strategy[Blue Ocean Strategy]
where instead of looking at strategic problems within a contested space you
look at problems in the larger uncontested space. To put this more simply,
consider this quote from ice hockey legend Wayne Gretzky: "skate to where the
puck is going to be, not where it has been".

=== Where can I find the source code?

The source code can be found on Github:

* link:http://github.com/jenkinsci/blueocean-plugin[Blue Ocean]
* link:http://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins-design-language[Jenkins Design Language]

=== What does this mean for the classic Jenkins UI?

The intention is that as Blue Ocean matures there will be less and less reasons
for users to go back to the existing UI.

For example, in the first version we will mainly be targeting Pipeline jobs.
You might be able to see your existing non-pipeline jobs in Blue Ocean but it
might not be possible to configure them from the new UI for some time. This
means users will have to jump back to the classic UI for configuration of
non-pipeline jobs.

There are likely going to be more examples of this and that's why the classic
UI will still be important in the long term.

=== Is this a CloudBees project?

The short answer is *"no"*. The project has been originated and sponsored by
CloudBees, but it is a *100% open project* (including sources, roadmaps, public
discussions, etc.). Everybody is invited to contribute to it.

To quote link:https://github.com/i386[James Dumay] (Blue Ocean Product Manager
at CloudBees):

____
While the project's inception has happened within CloudBees we see this project
being one owned by the community. At CloudBees we recognize the importance of a
vibrant and healthy Jenkins community, we see the company and community working
in symbiosis: a thriving developer community is good for CloudBees and CloudBees
provides time and money back into the community to make it stronger. Blue Ocean
is our way of giving back and strengthening. To that effect we've put together a
new a team of product, UX, frontend and backend developers (some old faces and a
lot of new ones!) that will be working on this project with the community full
time

=== What does this mean for my plugins?

Extensibility is a pretty core concept to Jenkins, so being able to extend the
Blue Ocean UI is important. Based on some research, we worked out a way to
allow "<ExtensionPoint name=..>" to be used in the markup of Blue Ocean,
leaving places for plugins to contribute to the UI (plugins can have their own
Blue Ocean extension points, just like they do today in Jenkins). Blue Ocean
itself (as it is so far) is implemented using these extension points.
Extensions are delivered by plugins, as normal, only if they wish to contribute
to the Blue Ocean experience they will have some additional javascript that
provides extensions.

=== What technologies are currently in use?

Blue Ocean is built as a collection of Jenkins plugins itself. There is one key
difference, however. It provides both its own endpoint for http requests and
delivers up html/javascript via a different path, without the existing Jenkins
UI markup/scripts. React.js and ES6 are used to deliver the javascript
components of Blue Ocean. Inspired by this excellent open source project
(link:https://nylas.com/blog/react-plugins[react-plugins]) an <ExtensionPoint>pattern was
established, that allows extensions to come from any Jenkins plugin (only with
Javascript) and should they fail to load, have failures isolated.
