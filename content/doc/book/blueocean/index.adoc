[blue-ocean]
= Blue Ocean User Experience

This chapter will cover all aspects of Jenkins Blue Ocean, from the Dashboard,
to viewing branches and results from individual Pipeline runs,
to using the visual editor to modify Pipeline code.

This chapter is intended to be used by Jenkins users of all skill levels,
but beginners may need to refer to some sections of "<<using#,Using Jenkins>>"
to understand some topics covered in this chapter.

If you are not yet familiar with basic Jenkins terminology and features, start with
<<getting-started#,Getting Started with Jenkins>>.

[[overview]]
== What is Blue Ocean?

Blue Ocean is a new project that rethinks the user experience of Jenkins.
Designed from the ground up for Jenkins Pipeline (but still compatible with Freestyle jobs),
Blue Ocean reduces clutter and increases clarity for every member of your team.

* *Sophisticated visualizations* of CD pipelines, allowing for fast and intuitive comprehension of software pipeline status.
* *Pipeline editor* (In Development) that makes automating CD pipelines approachable by guiding the user through an intuitive and visual process to create a pipeline.
* *Personalization* of the Jenkins UI to suit the role-based needs of each member of the DevOps team.
* *Pinpoint precision* when intervention is needed and/or issues arise. The Blue Ocean UI shows where in the pipeline attention is needed, facilitating exception handling and increasing productivity.
* *Native integration for branch and pull requests* enables maximum developer productivity when collaborating on code with others in GitHub and Bitbucket.

To start using Blue Ocean, see <<<blueocean/getting-started#,Getting Started with Blue Ocean>>.

. Developer? We've https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/issues/?filter=16142[labeled a few issues] that are great for anyone wanting to get started developing Blue Ocean. Don't forget to drop by the Gitter chat and introduce yourself!

== Features

Here are some are some of the features of Blue Ocean.

=== Designed for Pipelines

Blue Ocean is built from the ground up for Pipeline and uses its related concepts as a
foundation to enable use cases that Jenkins hasn't handled before. The visualization
makes it easy to follow along the flow of your Pipeline and gives you clarity
into your Continuous Delivery processes.

We know many developers spend a lot of time staring at logs in Jenkins. That’s
why we’ve broken up the log by step to make it much simpler to navigate.
Gone are the days h all spend scrolling through log files that are 10s of
thousands or 100s of thousands of lines long.

When you open the pipeline visualisation you can immediately identify what
problem that are causing the Pipeline to fail.

=== Personalized Dashboard

The Personalized Dashboard surfaces a single developer the things that they care
about so that they can work better with their team. It responds
preemptively to your activity showing you the status of Pipelines that you are
interested in.

If a developer favorites a Pipeline or one of its branches it will appear on the
dashboard. Pipelines needed the developers attention, such as failing Pipelines,
appear at the top of the dashboard.

And when the developer creates a branch in Git, Blue Ocean will automatically
favourite it for them. When the branch is deleted the Pipeline's branch is
removed from view.

=== Branches and Pull Requests

Blue Ocean uses Jenkins Pipeline to discover new branches with `Jenkinsfile`s and
 runs them for you so that you are testing your Pipeline with every new feature
 branch that you create.

If a developer opens a Pull Request against your repository, Jenkins will build it
using your Pipeline and update Github or Bitbucket with the status of the Pipeline.
This is extremely useful for reviewers of Pull Requests as successful Pipelines
improve confidence that changes will integrate without causing havoc.

=== Design Language

Jenkins is nothing without its ecosystem of 1000+ plugins and we believe it's
important that Blue Ocean brings them along for the ride. Most developers in
our community don't consider themselves hot shot frontend developers or
designers, that's why we are introducing a consistent design language and
accompanying JavaScript and CSS framework. If you're familiar with Google's
link:https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html[Material
Design], Twitter link:http://getbootstrap.com/[Bootstrap], Apple's
link:https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/[Human
Interface Guidelines] or Microsoft
link:https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh465424.aspx[Modern
UI] you will be right at home here.

For those curious about the technology stack here, we are working with a
combination of

and
link:https://medium.com/@tomastrajan/introduction-to-react-and-flux-6043d63610cd#.stjh5un3g[React]
which we believe will be provide a smooth learning experience for those strong
in Java skills but not so confident in CSS/JS.  React's component based way of
describing user interfaces also complements the way that Jenkins Extensibility
works. We've extended the plugin system and toolchain to work with React
components.
