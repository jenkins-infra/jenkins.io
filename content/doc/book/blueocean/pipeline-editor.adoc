= Pipeline Editor

The Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor is the simplest way for anyone wanting to get started with
creating Pipelines in Jenkins. It's also great way for advanced Jenkins users
to start adopting Pipeline.

It allows developers to break up their Pipeline into different
 stages and parallelize tasks that can occur at the same time - its all up to you.
When you are done authoring your Pipeline, the pipeline definition is saved back
 to your repository as a `Jenkinsfile`.

If you ever need to change the Pipeline again,
 the user interfaces allows you to jump back in into the editor to author the
 Pipeline at any time or you can do so in code by editing the `Jenkinsfile` directly.
