= Pipeline Run Details View

The Blue Ocean Pipeline Run Details view shows the information related to
a single Pipeline Run and allows users to edit or replay that run.
Below is a detailed overview of the parts of the Run Details view.

== Pipeline Run Status

Blue Ocean makes it easy to see the status of the current Pipeline Run by
changing the color of the top menu bar to match the status:
blue for "In progress", green for "Passed", yellow for "Unstable",
red for "Failed", and gray for "Aborted".

== Special cases

Blue Ocean is optimized for working with Pipelines in Source Control,
but it can display details for other kinds of projects as well.
Blue Ocean offers the same <<#subsections, subsections>> for all supported projects types,
but those subsections may display different information.

=== Pipelines outside of Souce Control

For Pipelines that are not based on Source Control,
Blue Ocean still shows the "Commit Id", "Branch", and "Changes",
but those fields are left blank.
In this case, the top menu bar does not include the "Edit" option.

=== Freestyle Projects

For Freestyle projects, Blue Ocean still offers the same <<#subsections, subsections>>,
but the Pipeline subsection only shows the console log output.
The "Rerun" or "Edit" options are also not shown in the top menu bar.

=== Matrix projects

Matrix projects are not supported in Blue Ocean.
Viewing a Matrix project will redirect to the "Classic UI" view for that project.

[[subsections]]
== Subsections

Each of the subsections of the Run Detail view provides details on a specific
aspect of a run.

=== Pipeline

This is the default subsection and gives an overall view of the flow of this Pipeline Run.
It shows each stage and parallel branch, the steps in those stages,
and the console output from those steps.

The overview image above shows a successful Pipeline run.
