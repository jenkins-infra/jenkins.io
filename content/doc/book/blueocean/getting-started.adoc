= Getting started with Blue Ocean

This section describes how to get started with Blue Ocean in Jenkins.
It includes instructions for link:#installing-blue-ocean[setting up Blue Ocean] on
your Jenkins controller, how to link:#accessing-blue-ocean[access the Blue Ocean UI], and link:#switching-to-the-classic-ui[returning to the Jenkins classic UI].

include::doc/book/blueocean/_blue-ocean-status.adoc[]

== Installing Blue Ocean

You can install Blue Ocean using the following methods:

* As a suite of plugins on an link:#on-an-existing-jenkins-instance[existing Jenkins controller]. 
* As a part of link:#as-part-of-jenkins-in-docker[Jenkins in Docker].

=== On an existing Jenkins controller

When Jenkins is installed on most platforms, the plugin:blueocean[Blue Ocean] plugin and all necessary dependent plugins, which compile the Blue Ocean suite of plugins, are not installed by default.


Plugins can be installed on a Jenkins controller by any Jenkins user who has the
*Administer* permission. This is set through *Matrix-based security*.
Jenkins users with this permission can also configure the permissions of other users on their system.
Refer to the link:../../security/managing-security/#authorization[Authorization] section of link:../../security/managing-security/[Managing Security] for more information.

To install the Blue Ocean suite of plugins to your Jenkins controller:

. Ensure you are logged in to Jenkins as a user with the *Administer* permission.
. From the Jenkins home page, select *Manage Jenkins* on the left and then *Plugins*.
. Select the *Available* tab and enter `blue ocean` in the *Filter* text box.
This filters the list of plugins based on the name and description.
+

. Select the box to the left of *Blue Ocean*, and then select either the *Download now and install after restart* option (recommended) or the *Install without restart* option at the bottom of the page.
+
[NOTE]
====
* It is not necessary to select other plugins in this list.
The main *Blue Ocean* plugin automatically selects and installs all dependent plugins, composing the Blue Ocean suite of plugins.
* If you select the *Install without restart* option, you must restart Jenkins to gain full Blue Ocean functionality.
====

Refer to thelink:../../managing/plugins[Managing Plugins] page for more information.
Blue Ocean does not require additional configuration after installation.
Existing Pipelines and projects will continue to work as usual.

NOTE: The first time you link:../creating-pipelines[create a Pipeline in Blue Ocean] for a specific Git server, Blue Ocean prompts you for your Git credentials to allow you to create Pipelines in the repositories.
This is required since Blue Ocean can add a `Jenkinsfile` to your repositories.

=== As part of Jenkins in Docker

The Blue Ocean suite of plugins is not bundled with the official Jenkins Docker image, link:https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jenkins/[`jenkins/jenkins`], which is available from the link:https://hub.docker.com/[Docker Hub repository].

Read more about running Jenkins and Blue Ocean inside Docker in the link:../../installing/#docker[Docker] section of the installing Jenkins page.

== Accessing Blue Ocean

Once a Jenkins environment has Blue Ocean installed and you log in to the
Jenkins classic UI, you can access the Blue Ocean UI by selecting *Open Blue
Ocean* on the left side of the screen.

[.boxshadow]

Alternatively, you can access Blue Ocean directly by appending `/blue` to the end of your Jenkins server's URL.
For example `\https://jenkins-server-url/blue`.

If your Jenkins controller:

* Already has existing Pipeline projects or other items present, the link:../dashboard[Blue Ocean Dashboard] displays.
* Is new or does not have projects or other items configured, Blue Ocean displays a *Welcome to Jenkins* pane with a *Create a new Pipeline* button.
You can select this to begin creating a new Pipeline project.
For more information, refer to the link:../creating-pipelines[Creating a Pipeline] page for more information on creating a Pipeline project in Blue Ocean.

== Navigation bar

The Blue Ocean UI has a navigation bar along the top of its interface, allowing you to access the different views and features.

The navigation bar is divided into two sections:

* A common section along the top of most Blue Ocean views.
* A contextual section below.

The contextual section is specific to the current Blue Ocean page you are viewing.

The navigation bar's common section includes the following buttons:

* *Jenkins*: Selecting the Jenkins icon takes you to the link:../dashboard[Dashboard] or reloads this page if you are already viewing it.
* *Pipelines*: This also takes you to the Dashboard.
If you are already on the Dashboard, this option reloads the page.
This button serves a different purpose when you are viewing a link:../pipeline-run-details[Pipeline run details] page.
* *Administration*: This takes you to the *link:../../managing[Manage Jenkins]* page of the Jenkins classic UI.
This button is not available if you do not have the *Administer* permission.
Refer to the link:../../managing/security/#authorization[Authorization] section of the Managing Security page for more information.
* *Go to classic* icon: This takes you back to the Jenkins classic UI.
Read more about this in <<switching-to-the-classic-ui>>.
* *Logout*: This logs out your current Jenkins user and returns you to the Jenkins login page.

Views that use the common navigation bar add another bar below it.
This second bar includes options specific to that view.
Some views replace the common navigation bar with one specifically suited to that view.

== Switching to the classic UI

Blue Ocean does not support some legacy or administrative features of Jenkins
that are necessary to some users.

If you need to access these features, select the *Go to classic* icon at the top of a common section of Blue Ocean's link:#navigation-bar[navigation bar].

[.boxshadow]
image:blueocean/intro/go-to-classic-icon.png[alt="Go to classic icon",width=5%]

Selecting this button takes you to the equivalent page in the Jenkins classic UI or the most relevant classic UI page that parallels the current page in Blue Ocean.
