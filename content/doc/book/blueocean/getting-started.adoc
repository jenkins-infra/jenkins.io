= Getting started with Blue Ocean

This section describes how to get started with Blue Ocean in Jenkins. It
includes instructions for link:#installing-blue-ocean[setting up Blue Ocean] on
your Jenkins instance as well as how to
link:#accessing-blue-ocean[access the Blue Ocean UI] and
link:#switching-to-the-classic-ui[return to the Jenkins classic UI].


== Installing Blue Ocean

Blue Ocean can be installed using the following methods:

* As a suite of plugins on an
  link:#on-an-existing-jenkins-instance[existing Jenkins instance], or
* As part of link:#as-part-of-jenkins-in-docker[Jenkins in Docker].


=== On an existing Jenkins instance

When Jenkins is installed on most platforms, the
plugin:blueocean[Blue Ocean plugin] and all its other dependent plugins (which
form the Blue Ocean "suite of plugins") are not installed by default.

To install the Blue Ocean suite of plugins on an existing Jenkins instance, your
Jenkins instance must be running Jenkins 2.7.x or later.

Plugins can be installed on a Jenkins instance by any Jenkins user who has the
*Administer* permission (set through *Matrix-based security*). Jenkins users
with this permission can also configure the permissions of other users on their
system. Read more about this in the
link:../../managing/security/#authorization[Authorization] section of
link:../../managing/security[Managing Security].

To install the Blue Ocean suite of plugins to your Jenkins instance:

. If required, ensure you are logged in to Jenkins (as a user with the
  *Administer* permission).
. From the Jenkins home page (i.e. the Dashboard of the Jenkins classic UI),
  click *Manage Jenkins* on the left and then *Manage Plugins* in the center.
. Click the *Available* tab and type `blue ocean` into the *Filter* text box,
  which filters the list of plugins to those whose name and/or description
  contains the words "blue" and "ocean".

. Select the *Blue Ocean* plugin's check box near the top of the the *Install*
  column and then click either the *Download now and install after restart*
  button (recommended) or the *Install without restart* button at the the end of
  the page. +
*Notes:*
* There is no need to select the check boxes of the other plugins in this
  filtered list because the main *Blue Ocean* plugin has other plugin
  dependencies (constituting the Blue Ocean suite of plugins) which will
  automatically be selected and installed when you click one of these "Install"
  buttons.
* If you chose the *Install without restart* button, you may need to restart
  Jenkins in order to gain full Blue Ocean functionality.

Read more about how to install and manage plugins in the
link:../../managing/plugins[Managing Plugins] page.

Blue Ocean requires no additional configuration after installation, and existing
Pipelines projects and other items such as freestyle projects will continue to
work as usual.

Be aware, however, that the first time a
link:../creating-pipelines[Pipeline is created in Blue Ocean] for a specific Git
server (i.e. GitHub, Bitbucket or an ordinary Git server), Blue Ocean prompts
you for credentials to access your repositories on the Git server in order to
create Pipelines based on those repositories. This is required since Blue Ocean
can write ``Jenkinsfile``s to your repositories.


=== As part of Jenkins in Docker

The Blue Ocean suite of plugins are also bundled with Jenkins as part of a
Jenkins Docker image
(link:https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkinsci/blueocean/[`jenkinsci/blueocean`]),
which is available from the link:https://hub.docker.com/[Docker Hub repository].

Read more about running Jenkins and Blue Ocean this way in the
link:../../installing/#docker[Docker] section of the
link:../../installing[Installing Jenkins] page.


== Accessing Blue Ocean

Once a Jenkins environment has Blue Ocean installed, after logging in to the
Jenkins classic UI, you can access the Blue Ocean UI by clicking *Open Blue
Ocean* on the left.

[.boxshadow]

Alternatively, you can access Blue Ocean directly by appending `/blue` to the
end of your Jenkins server's URL - e.g. `\http://jenkins-server-url/blue`.

If your Jenkins instance:

* already has existing Pipeline projects or other items present, then the
  link:../dashboard[Blue Ocean Dashboard] is displayed.
* is new or has no Pipeline projects or other items configured, then Blue Ocean
  displays a *Welcome to Jenkins* box with a *Create a new Pipeline* button you
  can use to begin creating a new Pipeline project. Read more about this in
  link:../creating-pipelines[Creating a Pipeline]. +

== Navigation bar

The Blue Ocean UI has a navigation bar along the top of its interface, which
allows you to access the different views and other features of Blue Ocean.

Th navigation bar is divided into two sections - a common section along the top
of most Blue Ocean views and a contextual section below. The contextual section
is specific to the current Blue Ocean page you are viewing.

The navigation bar's common section includes the following buttons:

* *Jenkins* logo - takes you to the link:../dashboard[Dashboard], or reloads
  this page if you are already viewing it.
* *Pipelines* - also takes you to the Dashboard, or does nothing if you are
  already viewing the Dashboard. This button serves a different purpose when you
  are viewing a link:../pipeline-run-details[Pipeline run details] page.
* *Administration* - takes you to the *link:../../managing[Manage Jenkins]* page
  of the Jenkins classic UI. +
  *Note:* This button is not available if your Jenkins user does not have the
  *Administer* permission (set through *Matrix-based security*). Read more about
  this in the link:../../managing/security/#authorization[Authorization] section
  of link:../../managing/security[Managing Security].
* *Go to classic* icon - takes you back to the Jenkins classic UI. Read more
  about this in <<switching-to-the-classic-ui>>.
* *Logout* - Logs out your current Jenkins user and returns to the Jenkins login
  page.

Views that use the standard navigation bar will add another bar below it with options specific to that view.
Some views replace the common navigation bar with one specifically suited to that view.


== Switching to the classic UI

Blue Ocean does not support some legacy or administrative features of Jenkins
that are necessary to some users.

If you need to leave the Blue Ocean user experience to access these features,
click the *Go to classic* icon at the top of common section of Blue Ocean's
link:#navigation-bar[navigation bar].

[.boxshadow]
image:blueocean/intro/go-to-classic-icon.png[alt="Go to classic icon",width=5%]

Clicking this button takes you to the equivalent page in the Jenkins classic UI,
or the most relevant classic UI page that parallels the current page in Blue
Ocean.
