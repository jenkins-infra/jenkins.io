== Architecting for Scale

=== Introduction

As an organization matures from a continuous delivery standpoint, its Jenkins
requirements will similarly grow. This growth is often reflected in the Jenkins
master's architecture, whether that be "vertical" or "horizontal" growth.

*Vertical growth* is when a master's load is increased by having more
configured jobs or orchestrating more frequent builds. This may also mean that
more teams are depending on that one master.

*Horizontal* growth is the creation of additional masters within an
organization to accommodate new teams or projects, rather than adding these
things to an existing single master.

There are potential pitfalls associated with each approach to scaling Jenkins,
but with careful planning, many of them can be avoided or managed. Here are
some things to consider when choosing a strategy for scaling your
organization's Jenkins instances:

* **Do you have the resources to run a distributed build system?** If possible,
  it is recommended set up dedicated build nodes that run separately from the
  Jenkins master. This frees up resources for the master to improve its
  scheduling performance and prevents builds from being able to modify any
  potentially sensitive data in the master's _$JENKINS_HOME_. This also allows
  for a single master to scale far more vertically than if that master were
  both the job builder and scheduler.
* **Do you have the resources to maintain multiple masters?** Jenkins masters
  will require regular plugin updates, semi-monthly core upgrades, and regular
  backups of configurations and build histories. Security settings and roles
  will have to be manually configured for each master. Downed masters will
  require manual restart of the Jenkins master and any jobs that were killed by
  the outage.
* **How mission critical are each team's projects?** Consider segregating the
  most vital projects to separate masters to minimize the impact of a single
  downed master. Also consider converting any mission-critical project
  pipelines to Pipeline jobs, which have the ability to survive a master-agent
  connection interruptions.
* **How important is a fast start-up time for your Jenkins instance?** The more
  jobs a master has configured, the longer it takes to load Jenkins after an
  upgrade or a crash. The use of folders and views to organize jobs can limit
  the number of that need to be rendered on start up.

=== Distributed Builds Architecture

A Jenkins master can operate by itself both managing the build environment and
executing the builds with its own executors and resources. If you stick with
this "standalone" configuration you will most likely run out of resources when
the number or the load of your projects increase.

To come back up and running with your Jenkins infrastructure you will need to
enhance the master (increasing memory, number of CPUs, etc). The time it takes
to maintain and upgrade the machine, the master together with all the build
environment will be down, the jobs will be stopped and the whole Jenkins
infrastructure will be unusable.

Scaling Jenkins in such a scenario would be extremely painful and would
introduce many "idle" periods where all the resources assigned to your build
environment are useless.

Moreover, executing jobs on the master's executors introduces a "security"
issue: the "jenkins" user that Jenkins uses to run the jobs would have full
permissions on all Jenkins resources on the master. This means that, with a
simple script, a malicious user can have direct access to private information
whose integrity and privacy could not be, thus,  guaranteed.

For all these reasons Jenkins supports the "master/agent" mode, where the
workload of building projects are delegated to multiple agents.

An agent is a machine set up to offload projects from the master. The method
with which builds are scheduled depends on the configuration given to each
project. For example, some projects may be configured to "restrict where this
project is run" which ties the project to a specific agent or set of labeled
agents. Other projects which omit this configuration will select an agent from
the available pool in Jenkins.

In a distributed builds environment, the Jenkins master will use its resources
to only handle HTTP requests and manage the build environment. Actual execution
of builds will be delegated to the agents. With this configuration it is
possible to horizontally scale an architecture, which allows a single Jenkins
installation to host a large number of projects and build environments.

==== Master/agent communication protocols

In order for a machine to be recognized an agent, it needs to run a specific
agent program to establish bi-directional communication with the master.

There are different ways to establish a connection between master and agent:

////
TODO: The terminology used in these two bullet points needs to be sychronised
with the actual Jenkins interface terminology
////

* *The SSH connector*: Configuring an agent to use the SSH connector is the
 preferred and the most stable way to establish master-agent communication.
 Jenkins has a built-in SSH client implementation. This means that the
 Jenkins master can easily communicate with any machine with an SSH server
 installed. The only requirement is that the public key of the master is
 part of the set of the authorized keys on the agent. Once the host and SSH key
 is defined for a new agent, Jenkins will establish a connection to
 the machine and bootstrap the agent process.

////
TODO: This whole bullet point/section needs to be rewritten to be more
clearly structured
also terminology here is old (s/JNLP/inbound/g), and WebSocket should be mentioned
////
* *The JNLP-TCP connector*: In this case the communication is established
  starting the agent through Java Web Start (JNLP). With this connector
  the Java Web Start program has to be launched in the machine in 2
  different ways:

 . Manually: by navigating to the Jenkins master URL in a browser on the agent.
   Once the Java Web Start icon is clicked, the agent will be launched on the
   machine. The downside of this approach is that the agents cannot be centrally
   managed by the Jenkins master and each/stop/start/update of the agent needs to
   be executed manually on the agent's machine in versions of Jenkins older than
   1.611. This approach is convenient when the master cannot instantiate the
   connection with the client, for example: with agents running inside a
   firewalled network connecting to a master located outside the firewall.

 . As a service: First you'll need to manually launch the agent using the above
   method. After manually launching it, _jenkins-slave.exe_ and
   _jenkins-slave.xml_ will be created in the agent's work directory. Now go to
   the command line to execute the following command:

////
TODO: This section on windows JNLP connection is not being indented or grouped
properly
////
[source, width="300"]
----
sc.exe create "<serviceKey>" start= auto binPath= "<path to jenkins-slave.exe>" DisplayName= "<service display name>"
----

_<serviceKey>_ is the name of the registry key to define this agent service and
<service display name> is the label that will identify the service in the
Service Manager interface.

To ensure that restarts are automated, you will need to download a agent jar
newer than v 2.37 and copy it to a permanent location on the machine. The
_.jar_ file can be found at:

[source, width="350"]
----
http://<your-jenkins-host>/jnlpJars/agent.jar
----

If running a version of Jenkins newer than 1.559, the _.jar_ will be kept
up to date each time it connects to the master.

 * *The JNLP-HTTP connector*: This approach is quite similar to the JNLP-TCP
   Java Web Start approach, with the difference in this case being that the
   agent is executed as headless and the connection can be tunneled via HTTP(s).
   The exact command can be found on your JNLP agent's configuration page:

[[jnlp_agent]]
.JNLP agent launch command
image::hardware-recommendations/jnlp-slave.png[scaledwidth=90%]

This approach is convenient for an execution as a daemon on Unix.

* *Custom-script*: It is also possible to create a custom script to initialize
  the communication between master and agent if the other solutions do not
  provide enough flexibility for a specific use-case. The only requirement is
  that the script runs the java program as a _java -jar agent.jar_ on the
  agent.

Windows agent set-up can either follow the standard SSH and JNLP approach  or
use a more Windows-specific configuration approach. Windows agents have the
following options:

* *SSH-connector approach with Putty*
* *SSH-connector approach with Cygwin and OpenSSH*:
  https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/SSH+slaves+and+Cygwin[This] is the
  easiest to setup and recommended approach.
* *Remote management facilities (WMI + DCOM)*: With this approach, which
  utilizes the
  plugin:windows-slaves[WMI Windows Agents Plugin]), the Jenkins master will register the agent on the
  windows agent machine creating a Windows service. The Jenkins master can
  control the agents, issuing stops/restarts/updates of the same. However this
  is difficult to set-up and not recommended.
* *JNLP-connector approach*: With
  https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Installing+Jenkins+as+a+Windows+service[this approach]
   it is possible to manually register the agent as Windows service,
  but it will not be possible to centrally manage it from the master. Each
  stop/start/update of the agent needs to be executed manually on the
  agent machine, unless running Jenkins 1.611 or newer.

=== Creating fungible agents

==== Configuring tools location on agents

The Jenkins Global configuration page lets you specify the tools needed during
the builds (i.e. Ant, Maven, Java, etc).

When defining a tool, it is possible to create a pointer to an existing
installation by giving the directory where the program is expected to be on the
agent. Another option is to let Jenkins take care of the installation of a
specific version in the given location. It is also possible to specify more
than one installation for the same tool since different jobs may need different
versions of the same tool.

The pre-compiled "Default" option calls whatever is already installed on the
agent and exists in the machine PATH, but this will return a failure if the
tool was not already installed and its location was not added to the PATH
system variable.

One best practice to avoid this failure is to configure a job with the
assumption that the target agent does not have the necessary tools installed,
and to include the tools' installation as part of the build process.


==== Define a policy to share agent machines

As mentioned previously, agents should be interchangeable and standardized in
order to make them sharable and to optimize resource usage.  Agents should not
be customized for a particular set of jobs, nor for a particular team.

Lately Jenkins has become more and more popular not only in CI but also in CD,
which means that it must orchestrate jobs and pipelines which involve different
teams and technical profiles: developers, QA people and Dev-Ops people.

In such a scenario, it might make sense to create customized and dedicated
agents: different tools are usually required by different teams (i.e.
Puppet/Chef for the Ops team) and teams' credentials are usually stored on the
agent in order to ensure their protection and privacy.

In order to ensure the execution of a job on a single/group of agents only
(i.e. iOS builds on OSX agents only), it is possible to tie the job to the
agent by specifying the agent's label in the job configuration page. Note that
the restriction has to be replicated in every single job to be tied and that
the agent won't be protected from being used by other teams.

==== Setting up cloud agents

Cloud build resources can be a solution for a case when it is necessary to
maintain a reasonably small cluster of agents on-premise while still providing
new build resources when needed.

In particular it is possible to offload the execution of the jobs to agents in
the cloud thanks to ad-hoc plugins which will handle the creation of the cloud
resources together with their destruction when they are not needed anymore:

* The plugin:ec2[EC2 Plugin]
  let Jenkins use AWS EC2 instances as cloud build resources when it runs out
  of on-premise agents. The EC2 agents will be dynamically created inside an
  AWS network and de-provisioned when they are not needed.
* The plugin:azure-vm-agents[Azure VM Agents Plugin]
  dynamically spins up Jenkins agents as Azure VMs per user provided 
  configuration via templates, including support for virtual network integration 
  and subnet placement. Idle agents can be configured for automatic shutdown 
  to reduce costs.
* The plugin:jclouds-jenkins[JCloud plugin]
  creates the possibility of executing the jobs on any cloud provider supported
  by JCloud libraries

=== Right-sizing Jenkins masters

Comprehensive hardware recommendations:

* Hardware: see the link:/doc/book/hardware-recommendations/#hardware-recommendations[Hardware Recommendations] page

==== Master division strategies

Designing the best Jenkins architecture for your organization is dependent on
how you stratify the development of your projects and can be constrained by
limitations of the existing Jenkins plugins.

The 3 most common forms of stratifying development by masters is:

1. **By environment (QA, DEV, etc)** - With this strategy, Jenkins masters are populated by jobs based on what environment they are deploying to.

* **Pros**
** Can tailor plugins on masters to be specific to that environment's needs
** Can easily restrict access to an environment to only users who will be using that environment

* **Cons**
** Reduces ability to create pipelines
** No way to visualize the complete flow across masters
** Outage of a master will block flow of all products

2. **By org chart** - This strategy is when masters are assigned to divisions within an organization.

* **Pros**
** Can tailor plugins on masters to be specific to that team's needs
** Can easily restrict access to a division's projects to only users who are within that division

* **Cons**
** Reduces ability to create cross-division pipelines
** No way to visualize the complete flow across masters
** Outage of a master will block flow of all products

3. **Group masters by product lines** - When a group of products, with on only critical product in each group, gets its own Jenkins masters.

* **Pros**
** Entire flows can be visualized because all steps are on one master
** Reduces the impact of one master's downtime on only affects a small subset of products

* **Cons**
** A strategy for restricting permissions must be devised to keep all users from having access to all items on a master.

When evaluating these strategies, it is important to weigh them against the
vertical and horizontal scaling pitfalls discussed in the introduction.

Another note is that a smaller number of jobs translates to faster recovery
from failures and more importantly a higher mean time between failures.

==== Calculating how many jobs, masters, and executors are needed

Having the best possible estimate of necessary configurations for a Jenkins
installation allows an organization to get started on the right foot with
Jenkins and reduces the number of configuration iterations needed to achieve an
optimal installation. The challenge for Jenkins architects is that true limit
of vertical scaling on a Jenkins master is constrained by whatever hardware is
in place for the master, as well as harder to quantify pieces like the types of
builds and tests that will be run on the build nodes.

There is a way to estimate roughly how many masters, jobs and executors will be
needed based on build needs and number of developers served. These equations
assume that the Jenkins master will have 5 cores with one core per 100 jobs
(500 total jobs/master) and that teams will be divided into groups of 40.

If you have information on the actual number of available cores on your planned
master, you can make adjustments to the
"number of masters" equations accordingly.

The equation for *estimating the number of masters and executors needed* when
the number of configured jobs is known is as follows:

[source, width="350"]
----
masters = number of jobs/500
executors = number of jobs * 0.03
----

The equation for *estimating the maximum number of jobs, masters, and executors
needed* for an organization based on the number of developers is as follows:

[source, width="350"]
----
number of jobs = number of developers * 3.333
number of masters = number of jobs/500
number of executors = number of jobs * 0.03
----

These numbers will provide a good starting point for a Jenkins installation,
but adjustments to actual installation size may be needed based on the types of
builds and tests that an installation runs.

==== Scalable storage for masters

It is also recommended to choose a master with consideration for future growth
in the number of plugins or jobs stored in your master's _$JENKINS_HOME_.
Storage is cheap and Jenkins does not require fast disk access to run well, so
it is more advantageous to invest in a larger machine for your master over a
faster one.

Different operating systems for the Jenkins master will also allow for
different approaches to expandable storage:

* *Spanned Volumes on Windows* - On NTFS devices like Windows, you can create a
  spanned volume that allows you to add new volumes to an existing one, but
  have them behave as a single volume. To do this, you will have to ensure that
  Jenkins is installed on a separate partition so that it can be converted to a
  spanned volume later.
* *Logical Volume Manager for Linux* - LVM manages disk drives and allows
  logical volumes to be resized on the fly. Many distributions of Linux use LVM
  when they are installed, but Jenkins should have its our LVM setup.
* *ZFS for Solaris* - ZFS is even more flexible than LVM and spanned volumes
  and just requires that the _$JENKINS_HOME_ be on its own filesystem. This
  makes it easier to create snapshots, backups, etc.
* *Symbolic Links* - For systems with existing Jenkins installations and who
  cannot use any of the above-mentioned methods, symbolic links (symlinks) may
  be used instead to store job folders on separate volumes with symlinks to
  those directories.

Additionally, to easily prevent a _$JENKINS_HOME_ folder from becoming bloated,
make it mandatory for jobs to discard build records after a specific time
period has passed and/or after a specific number of builds have been run. This
policy can be set on a job's configuration page.


=== Setting up a backup policy

It is a best practice to take regular backups of your $JENKINS_HOME. A backup
ensures that your Jenkins instance can be restored despite a misconfiguration,
accidental job deletion, or data corruption.

==== Finding your $JENKINS_HOME

**Windows**

If you install Jenkins with the Windows installer, Jenkins will be installed as
a service and the default _$JENKINS_HOME_ will be "C:\Program Files
(x86)\jenkins".

You can edit the location of your _$JENKINS_HOME_ by opening the jenkins.xml
file and editing the _$JENKINS_HOME_ variable, or going to the "Manage Jenkins"
screen, clicking on the "Install as Windows Service" option in the menu, and
then editing the "Installation Directory" field to point to another existing
directory.

**Mac OSX**

If you install Jenkins with the OS X installer, you can find and edit the
location of your _$JENKINS_HOME_ by editing the "Macintosh
HD/Library/LaunchDaemons" file's _$JENKINS_HOME_ property.

By default, the _$JENKINS_HOME_ will be set to "Macintosh
HD/Users/Shared/Jenkins".

**Ubuntu/Debian**

If you install Jenkins using a Debian package, you can find and edit the
location of your _$JENKINS_HOME_ by editing your "/etc/default/jenkins" file.

By default, the _$JENKINS_HOME_ will set to "/var/lib/jenkins" and your
$JENKINS_WAR will point to "/usr/share/jenkins/jenkins.war".

**Red Hat/CentOS/Fedora**

If you install Jenkins as a RPM package, the default _$JENKINS_HOME_ will be
"/var/lib/jenkins".

You can edit the location of your _$JENKINS_HOME_ by editing the
"/etc/sysconfig/jenkins" file.

**openSUSE**

If installing Jenkins as a package using zypper, you'll be able to edit the
_$JENKINS_HOME_ by editing the "/etc/sysconfig/jenkins" file.

The default location for your _$JENKINS_HOME_ will be set to "/var/lib/jenkins"
and the $JENKINS_WAR home will be in "/usr/lib/jenkins".

**FreeBSD**

If installing Jenkins using a port, the _$JENKINS_HOME_ will be located in
whichever directory you run the "make" command in. It is recommended to create
a "/usr/ports/devel/jenkins" folder and compile Jenkins in that directory.

You will be able to edit the _$JENKINS_HOME_ by editing the
"/usr/local/etc/jenkins".

**OpenBSD**

If installing Jenkins using a package,the _$JENKINS_HOME_ is set by default to
"/var/jenkins".

If installing Jenkins using a port, the _$JENKINS_HOME_ will be located in
whichever directory you run the "make" command in. It is recommended to create
a "/usr/ports/devel/jenkins" folder and compile Jenkins in that directory.

You will be able to edit the _$JENKINS_HOME_ by editing the
"/usr/local/etc/jenkins" file.

**Solaris/OpenIndiana**

The Jenkins project voted on September 17, 2014 to discontinue Solaris
packages.

==== Anatomy of a $JENKINS_HOME

The folder structure for a _$JENKINS_HOME_ directory is as follows:

[source]
----
JENKINS_HOME
 +- config.xml     (Jenkins root configuration file)
 +- *.xml          (other site-wide configuration files)
 +- identity.key   (RSA key pair that identifies an instance)
 +- secret.key     (deprecated key used for some plugins' secure operations)
 +- secret.key.not-so-secret  (used for validating _$JENKINS_HOME_ creation date)
 +- userContent    (files served under your https://server/userContent/)
 +- secrets        (root directory for the secret+key for credential decryption)
     +- hudson.util.Secret   (used for encrypting some Jenkins data)
     +- master.key           (used for encrypting the hudson.util.Secret key)
     +- InstanceIdentity.KEY (used to identity this instance)
 +- fingerprints   (stores fingerprint records, if any)
 +- plugins        (root directory for all Jenkins plugins)
     +- [PLUGINNAME]   (sub directory for each plugin)
         +- META-INF       (subdirectory for plugin manifest + pom.xml)
         +- WEB-INF        (subdirectory for plugin jar(s) and licenses.xml)
     +- [PLUGINNAME].jpi   (.jpi or .hpi file for the plugin)
 +- jobs           (root directory for all Jenkins jobs)
     +- [JOBNAME]      (sub directory for each job)
         +- config.xml     (job configuration file)
         +- workspace      (working directory for the version control system)
         +- latest         (symbolic link to the last successful build)
         +- builds         (stores past build records)
             +- [BUILD_ID]     (subdirectory for each build)
                 +- build.xml      (build result summary)
                 +- log            (log file)
                 +- changelog.xml  (change log)
     +- [FOLDERNAME]   (sub directory for each folder)
         +- config.xml     (folder configuration file)
         +- jobs           (sub directory for all nested jobs)
----

[[segrate-data]]
===== Segregating pure configuration from less durable data

CAUTION: No data migration is handled by Jenkins when using those settings.
So you either want to use them from the beginning, or make sure you take into consideration which data you would like to be moved to the right place before using the following switches.

It is possible to separate customize some of the layout to better separate pure job configurations from less durable data, like build data or logs.
footnote:[These switches are used to configure out of the box link:/blog/2018/04/06/jenkins-essentials/[Jenkins Essentials] instances.]

====== Configure a different _jobs build data_ layout

Historically, the configuration of a given job is located under `$JENKINS_HOME/jobs/[JOB_NAME]/config.xml` and its builds are under `$JENKINS_HOME/jobs/[JOB_NAME]/builds`.

This typically makes it more impractical to set up a different backup policy, or set up a quicker disk for making builds potentially faster.

For instance, if you would like to move builds under a different root, you can use the following value: `+$JENKINS_VAR/${ITEM_FULL_NAME}/builds+`.

Note that starting with Jenkins 2.119, the User Interface for this was replaced by the `jenkins.model.Jenkins.buildsDir` system property. See the link:/doc/book/managing/system-properties/[dedicated _Features Controlled with System Properties_ wiki page] for more details.

////
NOT documenting the other jenkins.model.Jenkins.workspacesDir property on purpose, as this should generally not be used.
Using it means one would build on the master, which we clearly do not want to encourage.
////

==== Choosing a backup strategy

All of your Jenkins-specific configurations that need to be backed up will live
in the _$JENKINS_HOME_, but it is a best practice to back up only a subset of
those files and folders.

Below are a few guidelines to consider when planning your backup strategy.

.Exclusions

When it comes to creating a backup, it is recommended to exclude archiving the
following folders to reduce the size of your backup:

[literal]
/war      (the exploded Jenkins war directory)
/cache    (downloaded tools)
/tools    (extracted tools)

These folders will automatically be recreated the next time a build runs or
Jenkins is launched.

.Jobs and Folders

Your job or folder configurations, build histories, archived artifacts, and
workspace will exist entirely within the _jobs_ folder.

The _jobs_ directory, whether nested within a folder or at the root level is as
follows:

[source]
----
 +- jobs           (root directory for all Jenkins jobs)
     +- [JOBNAME]      (sub directory for each job)
         +- config.xml     (job configuration file)
         +- workspace      (working directory for the version control system)
         +- latest         (symbolic link to the last successful build)
         +- builds         (stores past build records)
             +- [BUILD_ID]     (subdirectory for each build)
                 +- build.xml      (build result summary)
                 +- log            (log file)
                 +- changelog.xml  (change log)
----

If you only need to backup your job configurations, you can opt to only backup
the _config.xml_ for each job. Generally build records and workspaces do not
need to be backed up, as workspaces will be re-created when a job is run and
build records are only as important as your organizations deems them.

.System configurations

Your instance's system configurations exist in the root level of the
_$JENKINS_HOME_ folder:

[literal]
 +- config.xml     (Jenkins root configuration file)
 +- *.xml          (other site-wide configuration files)

The _config.xml_ is the root configuration file for your Jenkins. It includes
configurations for the paths of installed tools, workspace directory, and
agent port.

Any .xml other than that _config.xml_ in the root Jenkins folder is a global
configuration file for an installed tool or plugin (i.e. Maven, Git, Ant, etc).
This includes the _credentials.xml_ if the Credentials plugin is installed.

If you only want to backup your core Jenkins configuration, you only need to
back up the _config.xml_.

.Plugins

Your instance's plugin files (.hpi and .jpi) and any of their dependent
resources (help files, _pom.xml_ files, etc) will exist in the _plugins_ folder
in $JENKINS_HOME.

[literal]
 +- plugins        (root directory for all Jenkins plugins)
     +- [PLUGINNAME]     (sub directory for each plugin)
         +- META-INF       (subdirectory for plugin manifest + pom.xml)
         +- WEB-INF        (subdirectory for plugin jar(s) and licenses.xml)
     +- [PLUGINNAME].jpi (.jpi or .hpi file for the plugin)

It is recommended to back up the entirety of the plugins folder (.hpi/.jpis + folders).

.Other data

Other data that you are recommended to back up include the contents of your
_secrets_ folder, your _identity.key_, your _secret.key_, and your
_secret.key.not-so-secret_ file.

[literal]
+- identity.key   (RSA key pair that identifies an instance)
 +- secret.key     (used for various secure Jenkins operations)
 +- secret.key.not-so-secret  (used for validating _$JENKINS_HOME_ creation date)
 +- userContent    (files served in https://server/userContent/)
 +- secrets        (directory for the secret+key decryption)
     +- hudson.util.Secret   (used for encrypting some Jenkins data)
     +- master.key           (used for encrypting the hudson.util.Secret key)
     +- InstanceIdentity.KEY (used to identity this instance)


The _identity.key_ is an RSA key pair that identifies and authenticates the
current Jenkins instance.

The _secret.key_ is used to encrypt plugin and other Jenkins data, and to
establish a secure connection between a master and agent.

The _secret.key.not-so-secret_ file is used to validate when the
_$JENKINS_HOME_ was created. It is also meant to be a flag that the secret.key
file is a deprecated way of encrypting information.

The files in the secrets folder are used by Jenkins to encrypt and decrypt your
instance's stored credentials, if any exist. Loss of these files will prevent
recovery of any stored credentials. _hudson.util.Secret_ is used for encrypting
some Jenkins data like the credentials.xml, while the _master.key_ is used for
encrypting the hudson.util.Secret key. Finally, the _InstanceIdentity.KEY_ is
used to identity this instance and for producing digital signatures.

==== Define a Jenkins instance to rollback to

In the case of a total machine failure, it is important to ensure that there is
a plan in place to get Jenkins both back online and in its last good state.

If a high availability set up has not been enabled and no back up of that
master's filesystem has been taken, then an corruption of a machine running
Jenkins means that all historical build data and artifacts, job and system
configurations, etc. will be lost and the lost configurations will need to be
recreated on a new instance.

1. Backup policy - In addition to creating backups using the previous section's
   backup guide, it is important to establish a policy for selecting which backup
   should be used when restoring a downed master.
2. Restoring from a backup - A plan must be put in place on whether the backup
   should be restored manually or with scripts when the primary goes down.

=== Resilient Jenkins Architecture

Administrators are constantly adding more and more teams to the software
factory, making administrators in the business of making their instances
resilient to failures and scaling them in order to onboard more teams.

Adding build nodes to a Jenkins instance while beefing up the machine that runs
the Jenkins master is the typical way to scale Jenkins. Said differently,
administrators scale their Jenkins master vertically. However, there is a limit
to how much an instance can be scaled. These limitations are covered in the
introduction to this chapter.

Ideally, masters will be set up to automatically recover from failures without
human intervention. There are proxy servers monitoring active masters and
re-routing requests to backup masters if the active master goes down. There are
additional factors that should be reviewed on the path to continuous delivery.
These factors include componetizing the application under development,
automating the entire pipeline (within reasonable limits) and freeing up
contentious resources.

.Step 1: Make each master highly available

Each Jenkins master needs to be set up such that it is part of a Jenkins cluster.

A proxy (typically HAProxy or F5) then fronts the primary master. The proxy's
job is to continuously monitor the primary master and route requests to the
backup if the primary goes down. To make the infrastructure more resilient, you
can have multiple backup masters configured.

.Step 2: Enable security

Set up an authentication realm that Jenkins will use for its user database.

TIP: If you are trying to set up a proof-of-concept, it is recommended to use
the plugin:mock-security-realm[Mock Security Realm plugin] for authentication.

.Step 3: Add build nodes (agents) to master

Add build servers to your master to ensure you are conducting actual build
execution off of the master, which is meant to be an orchestration hub, and
onto a "dumb" machine with sufficient memory and I/O for a given job or test.

.Step 4: Setup a test instance

A test instance is typically used to test new plugin updates. When a plugin is
ready to be used, it should be installed into the main production update
center.
