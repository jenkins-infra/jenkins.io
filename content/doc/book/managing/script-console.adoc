= Script Console

Jenkins features a Groovy script console which allows one to run
arbitrary Groovy scripts within the Jenkins master runtime or in the
runtime on agents.

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is _very_ *important* to understand all of the following points
because it affects the integrity of your Jenkins installation. The
Jenkins Script Console:

* Access is controlled by the `+RunScripts+` permission. If any authorization strategy allows this permission to be granted to users other than Admins, then extreme care should be taken not to allow non-admins to use this.

* Is a web-based Groovy shell into the Jenkins runtime. Groovy is a very
powerful language which offers the ability to do practically anything
Java can do including:

** Create sub-processes and execute arbitrary commands on the Jenkins
master and agents.
** It can even read files in which the Jenkins master has access to on
the host (like `/etc/passwd`)
** Decrypt credentials configured within Jenkins.

* Offers no administrative controls to stop a User (or Admin) once they
are able to execute the Script Console from affecting all parts of the
Jenkins infrastructure. Granting a normal Jenkins user Script Console
Access is essentially the same as giving them Administrator rights
within Jenkins.
* Can configure any Jenkins setting. It can disable security,
reconfigure security, even open a backdoor on the host operating system
completely outside of the Jenkins process. Due to the mission critical
importance many organizations place on Jenkins in their infrastructure
this point is especially important because it would allow an attacker to
move laterally within infrastructure with little effort.
* Is so powerful because it was originally intended as a debugging
interface for Jenkins developers but has since grown into an interface
used by Jenkins Admins to configure Jenkins and debug Jenkins runtime
issues.

Because of the power offered by the Jenkins Script Console, Jenkins and
its agents should never be run as the `root` user (on Linux) or system
administrator on any other flavor of OS. Videos linked in this
page demonstrate and discuss security warnings.

*Be sure to secure your Jenkins instance*

== Multiple contexts

The Jenkins Script Console can run either on the master or any
configured agents.

=== Running Script Console on the master

This feature can be accessed from "Manage Jenkins" > "Script Console". 
Or by visiting the sub-URL `/script` on your Jenkins instance.

=== Running Script Console on agents

Visit "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Nodes".  Select any node to view the
status page.  In the menu on the left, a menu item is available to open
a "Script Console" on that specific agent.

=== Run scripts from master Script Console on agents

It's also possible to run scripts from the master Script Console on
individual agents.  The following script is an example running a script
on agents from the master Script Console.

*Script executes code on agent from Master Script Console*

[source,groovy]
----
import hudson.util.RemotingDiagnostics
import jenkins.model.Jenkins

String agent_name = 'your agent name'
//groovy script you want executed on an agent
groovy_script = '''
println System.getenv("PATH")
println "uname -a".execute().text
'''.trim()

String result
Jenkins.instance.slaves.find { agent ->
    agent.name == agent_name
}.with { agent ->
    result = RemotingDiagnostics.executeGroovy(groovy_script, agent.channel)
}
println result
----

== Remote access

A Jenkins Admin can execute groovy scripts remotely by sending an HTTP
POST request to `/script/` url or `/scriptText/`.

*curl example via bash*

[source,shell]
----
curl -d "script=<your_script_here>" https://jenkins/script
# or to get output as a plain text result (no HTML)
curl -d "script=<your_script_here>" https://jenkins/scriptText
----

Also, link:/doc/book/managing/cli/[Jenkins CLI]
offers the possibility to execute groovy scripts remotely using
`groovy` command or execute groovy interactively via `groovysh`.
However, once again curl can be used to execute groovy scripts by making
use of bash command substitution. In the following example
`somescript.groovy` is a groovy script in the current working
directory.

*Curl submitting groovy file via bash*

[source,shell]
----
curl --data-urlencode "script=$(< ./somescript.groovy)" https://jenkins/scriptText
----

If security is configured in Jenkins, then curl can be provided options
to authenticate using the `curl --user` option.

*Curl submitting groovy file providing username and api token via bash*

[source,shell]
----
curl --user 'username:api-token' --data-urlencode \
  "script=$(< ./somescript.groovy)" https://jenkins/scriptText
----

Here is the equivalent command using python, not curl.

*Python submitting groovy file providing username and api token*

[source,python]
----
with open('somescript.groovy', 'r') as fd:
    data = fd.read()
r = requests.post('https://jenkins/scriptText', auth=('username', 'api-token'), data={'script': data})
----

== Shortcut key on script console to submit

You can submit a script without mouse. Jenkins has a shortcut key which
enables to submit with keyboard.

* Windows / Linux: Ctrl + Enter
* Mac: Command + Enter

== Video Tutorials and additional learning materials

Here are some recorded videos on the Jenkins Script Console:

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaUPESDcsGg[Jenkins World 2017:
Mastering the Jenkins Script Console] - 44 minutes - sample usage and
security discussion
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1x2kCGRY1w[LA Jenkins Area Meetup
2016 - Hacking on Jenkins Internals - Jenkins Script Console] - 39
minutes - sample usage

To expand your ability to write scripts in the script console, the following
references are recommended:

* http://groovy-lang.org/learn.html[Learn Groovy] - Learning Groovy is
useful for more than writing scripts for the Script Console.  Groovy is
also relevant for other features of Jenkins like
link:/doc/book/pipeline/[Pipelines and shared pipeline
libraries], the
https://plugins.jenkins.io/groovy[Groovy Plugin],
the https://plugins.jenkins.io/job-dsl[Job DSL
plugin], and many other plugins which utilize Groovy (see section
<<Plugins-enabling-Groovy-usage>>).
* http://www.mdoninger.de/2011/11/07/write-groovy-scripts-for-jenkins-with-code-completion.html[Write
Groovy scripts for Jenkins with Code completion] - The gist of this is
to create a Maven project within your IDE and to depend
on org.jenkins-ci.main:jenkins-core (and any other plugins that you
expect present). You can then write a Groovy script with code completion
of Jenkins API objects and methods.

== Example Groovy scripts

=== Out of date scripts

Due to the nature of Groovy scripts accessing Jenkins source code
directly, Script Console scripts are easily out of date from the Jenkins
source code. It is possible to run a script and get exceptions because
public methods and interfaces in Jenkins core or Jenkins plugins have
changed. Keep this in mind when trying out examples. Jenkins is easily
started from a local development machine via the following command:

*Starting a local copy of Jenkins*

[source,shell]
----
export JENKINS_HOME="./my_jenkins_home"
java -jar jenkins.war
----

Use CTRL+C to stop Jenkins. It is not recommended to try Script Console
examples in a production Jenkins instance.
