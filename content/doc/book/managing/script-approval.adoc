= In-process Script Approval

Jenkins, and a number of plugins, allow users to execute
Groovy scripts _in_ Jenkins. These scripting capabilities are provided by:

* <<script-console#, Script Console>>.
* <<../pipeline#, Jenkins Pipeline>>.
* The plugin:email-ext[Extended Email plugin].
* The plugin:groovy[Groovy plugin] - when using the "Execute system Groovy
  script" step.
* The plugin:job-dsl[JobDSL plugin] as of version 1.60 and later.

To protect Jenkins from execution of malicious scripts, these plugins execute
user-provided scripts in a <<groovy-sandbox>> that limits what internal APIs
are accessible. This protection is provided by the plugin:script-security[Script Security plugin]. As soon as unsafe method is used in any of the scripts, the "In-process Script Approval"
action should appear in "Manage Jenkins" to allow Administrators to make a decision about
which unsafe methods, if any, should be allowed in the Jenkins environment.

== Getting Started

The plugin:script-security[Script Security plugin] is installed automatically
by the
link:../../getting-started/installing#post-install-setup-wizard[Post-install Setup Wizard],
although initially no additional scripts or operations are approved for use.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Older versions of this plugin may not be safe to use. Please review the
security warnings listed on plugin:script-security[the Script Security plugin page]
in order to ensure that the plugin:script-security[Script Security plugin] is
up to date.
====

Security for in-process scripting is provided by two different mechanisms: the
<<groovy-sandbox>> and <<script-approval>>. The first, the Groovy Sandbox, is
enabled by default for link:/doc/book/pipeline[Jenkins Pipeline] allowing
user-supplied Scripted and Declarative Pipeline to execute without prior
Administrator intervention. The second, Script
Approval, allows Administrators to approve or deny unsandboxed scripts, or
allow sandboxed scripts to execute additional methods.

For most instances, the combination of the Groovy Sandbox and the
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/script-security-plugin/tree/master/src/main/resources/org/jenkinsci/plugins/scriptsecurity/sandbox/whitelists[Script Security's built-in list]
of approved method signatures, will be sufficient. It is strongly recommended
that Administrators only deviate from these defaults if absolutely necessary.

[[groovy-sandbox]]
== Groovy Sandbox

To reduce manual interventions by Administrators, most scripts will run in a
Groovy Sandbox by default, including all
link:/doc/book/pipeline[Jenkins Pipelines].
The sandbox only allows a subset of Groovy's methods deemed sufficiently safe
for "untrusted" access to be executed without prior approval. Scripts using
the Groovy Sandbox are *all* subject to the same restrictions, therefore a
Pipeline authored by an Administrator is subject to the
restrictions as one authorized by a non-administrative user.

When a script attempts to use features or methods unauthorized by the sandbox,
a script is halted immediately, as shown below with Jenkins Pipeline

The Pipeline above will not execute until an Administrator
<<approving-method-signature, approves the method signature>> via the
*In-process Script Approval* page.

In addition to adding approved method signatures, users may also disable the
Groovy Sandbox entirely as shown below. Disabling the Groovy Sandbox requires
that the **entire** script must be reviewed and
<<approving-unsandboxed-pipeline, manually approved>> by an administrator.

[[script-approval]]
== Script Approval

Manual approval of entire scripts, or method signatures, by an administrator
provides Administrators with additional flexibility to support more advanced
usages of in-process scripting. When the <<groovy-sandbox>> is disabled, or a
method outside of the built-in list is invoked, the Script Security plugin will
check the Administrator-managed list of approved scripts and methods.

For scripts which wish to execute outside of the <<groovy-sandbox>>, the
Administrator must approve the *entire* script in the *In-process Script
Approval* page:

[[approving-unsandboxed-pipeline]]
.Approving an unsandboxed Scripted Pipeline
image::managing/inprocess-script-approval-pipeline.png["Approving an unsandboxed Scripted Pipeline", role=center]


For scripts which use the <<groovy-sandbox>>, but wish to execute an currently
unapproved method signature will also be halted by Jenkins, and require an
Administrator to approve the specific method signature before the script is
allowed to execute:

[[approving-method-signature]]
.Approving a new method signature

=== Approve assuming permissions check


Script approval provides three options: Approve, Deny, and "Approve assuming
permissions check." While the purpose of the first two are self-evident, the
third requires some additional understanding of what internal data scripts are
able to access and how permissions checks inside of Jenkins function.

Consider a script which accesses the method
`hudson.model.AbstractItem.getParent()`, which by itself is harmless and will
return an object containing either the folder or root item which contains the
currently executing Pipeline or Job. Following that method invocation,
executing `hudson.model.ItemGroup.getItems()`, which will list items in the
folder or root item, requires the `Job/Read` permission.

This could mean that approving the `hudson.model.ItemGroup.getItems()` method
signature would allow a script to bypass built-in permissions checks.

Instead, it is usually more desirable to click *Approve assuming permissions
check* which will cause the Script Approval engine to allow the method
signature assuming the user running the script has the permissions to execute
the method, such as the `Job/Read` permission in this example.
