= Jenkins Features Controlled with System Properties

Jenkins has several "hidden" features that can be enabled with system properties.
This page describes how to configure them on your instance.

== Usage

System properties are defined by passing `+-Dproperty=value+` to the `+java+` command line to start Jenkins.
Make sure to pass all of these arguments *before* the `+-jar+` argument,
otherwise they will be ignored.
Example:

```sh
java -Dhudson.footerURL=http://example.org -jar jenkins.war
```

The following table lists the properties and the version of Jenkins they were introduced in.

* *Property* - Java property name
* *Default* - Default value if not explicitly set
* *Version* - The version of Jenkins the property was introduced in
* *Notes* - Other notes

=== Compatibility notice

We do **NOT** guarantee compatibility for system properties.
These switches are often experimental in nature, and subject to change without notice.
If you find some of those useful, please file a ticket to promote it to the official feature.

Downside - builds appear in the queue with a noticeable delay.

|hudson.model.Queue.Saver.DELAY_SECONDS |60 |2.109 |Maximal delay of a save operation when content of Jenkins queue changes.
This works as a balancing factor between queue
consistency guarantee in case of Jenkins crash (short delay) and
decreasing IO activity based on Jenkins load (long delay).

|hudson.model.Run.ArtifactList.listCutoff |16 |1.330 |More artifacts
than this will use tree view or simple link rather than listing out artifacts

|hudson.model.Run.ArtifactList.treeCutoff |40 |1.330 |More artifacts

|Whether admins accessing `+/user/example+` creates a user record (see
SECURITY-406 on
https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/SECURITY/Jenkins+Security+Advisory+2017-02-01[Jenkins
Security Advisory 2017-02-01])

|hudson.model.User.SECURITY_243_FULL_DEFENSE |true |1.651.2 / 2.3 |When

Disable security hardening related to Stapler routing for PluginManager

Possibly unsafe,
https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2018-12-05/#SECURITY-595[see

|hudson.Util.maxFileDeletionRetries |3 |2.2 |The number of times to
attempt to delete files/directory trees +
before giving up and throwing an exception. +
Specifying a value less than 1 is invalid and will be treated as if a
value of 1 (i.e. one attempt, no retries) was specified. +
See https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-10113[JENKINS-10113]
and https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-15331[JENKINS-15331].

|hudson.Util.deletionRetryWait |100 |2.2 |The time (in milliseconds) to
wait between attempts to delete files when retrying. This has no effect
unless _hudson.Util.maxFileDeletionRetries_ is greater than 1. +
If zero, there will be no delay between attempts. If negative, the delay
will be a (linearly) increasing multiple of this value between attempts.

|hudson.Util.performGCOnFailedDelete |false |2.2 |If this flag is set to
true then we will request a garbage collection after a deletion failure
before we next retry the delete. It is ignored unless
_hudson.Util.maxFileDeletionRetries_ is greater than 1. +
Setting this flag to true _may_ resolve some problems on Windows, and
also for directory trees residing on an NFS share, but it can have a
negative impact on performance and may have no effect at all (GC
behavior is JVM-specific). +
Warning: This should only ever be used if you find that your builds are
failing because Jenkins is unable to delete files, that this failure is
because Jenkins itself has those files locked "open", and even then it
should only be used on slaves with relatively few executors (because the
garbage collection can impact the performance of all job executors on
that slave). +
_Setting this flag is a act of last resort - it is not recommended, and
should not be used on your main Jenkins server unless you can tolerate
the performance impact_.

|jenkins.CLI.disabled |false |2.32 and 2.19.3 |`+true+` to disable
Jenkins CLI via JNLP and HTTP (SSHD can still be enabled)

|jenkins.model.Jenkins.buildsDir |$\{ITEM_ROOTDIR}/builds |2.119 a|
The configuration of a given job is located
under `+$JENKINS_HOME/jobs/[JOB_NAME]/config.xml+` and its builds are
under `+$JENKINS_HOME/jobs/[JOB_NAME]/builds+` by default.

This option allows you to store builds elsewhere, which can be useful
with finer-grained backup policies, or to store the build data on a
faster disk such as an SSD.

The following placeholders are supported for this value:

* *$\{JENKINS_HOME}*  – Resolves to the Jenkins home directory.
* *$\{ITEM_ROOTDIR}* – The directory containing the job metadata within
Jenkins home.
* *$\{ITEM_FULL_NAME}* – The full name of the item, with file system
unsafe characters  replaced by others. +
*$\{ITEM_FULLNAME}* – See above, but does not replace unsafe characters.
This is a legacy option and should not be used.

For instance, if you would like to store builds outside of Jenkins home,
you can use a value like the
following: `+/some_other_root/builds/${ITEM_FULL_NAME}+`

This used to be a UI setting, but was removed in 2.119 as it did not
support migration of existing build records and could lead to
build-related errors until restart.

|jenkins.model.Jenkins.disableExceptionOnNullInstance |false |2.4 *only*

details.

|jenkins.model.StandardArtifactManager.disableTrafficCompression |false
|2.196 |`+true+` to disable GZIP compression of artifacts when they're
transferred from slave nodes to master.  Uses less CPU at the cost of
increased network traffic.

|jenkins.InitReactorRunner.concurrency |2x of CPU | + |During start of
Jenkins, loading of jobs in parallel have a fixed number of threads by
default (twice the CPU). To make Jenkins load time 8x faster, increase
it to 8x. For example, 24 CPU Jenkins Master host use this:
-Dhudson.InitReactorRunner.concurrency=192

|jenkins.install.runSetupWizard |undefined |2.0 a|
Set to `+false+` to skip install wizard. Note that this leaves Jenkins
unsecured by default. +

== Properties in plugins

Plugins may define their own system properties.
See the plugin documentation for more info.

== Properties in other components

Particular Jenkins component have their own release cycle and
documentation. In particular cases such components also include System
Properties.
