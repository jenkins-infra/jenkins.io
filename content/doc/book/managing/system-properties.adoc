# Style guide:
# - Prefer literal blocks over quoted blocks when necessary
# - Format literal default values in `backticks` and descriptive parts of values outside backticks
# - Use sentence-per-line formatting for descriptions

# Tags:
# - development: Mostly or only useful during development and debugging. While in rare cases these may help troubleshoot an instance, primary use is development.
# - escape hatch: Disables a behavior that is not generally expected to be disabled, such as security fixes. Intended to address unexpected compatibility problems.
# - feature: Enables (or rarely disables) a feature. Distinction to escape hatches is fuzzy when it disables.
# - internal: Not intended to be set by administrators, developers, or packaging scripts at all. Very rare.
# - obsolete: This option no longer has an effect or a different option should be used instead.
# - packaging: Options generally only useful when customizing the Jenkins packaging.
# - security: Related to security, both security fixes, and hardening. Usually also escape hatches.
# - tuning: Adjust thresholds, durations, and values of a similar nature that don't substantially alter behavior.
# - ui: User interface related.

    Setting this flag to `true` _may_ resolve some problems on Windows, and also for directory trees residing on an NFS share, but it can have a negative impact on performance and may have no effect at all (GC behavior is JVM-specific).
    **Warning**: This should only ever be used if you find that your builds are failing because Jenkins is unable to delete files, that this failure is because Jenkins itself has those files locked "open", and even then it should only be used on agents with relatively few executors (because the garbage collection can impact the performance of all job executors on that agent).
    _Setting this flag is a act of last resort - it is not recommended, and should not be used on your main Jenkins server unless you can tolerate the performance impact_.

    The configuration of a given job is located under `$JENKINS_HOME/jobs/[JOB_NAME]/config.xml` and its builds are under `$JENKINS_HOME/jobs/[JOB_NAME]/builds` by default.
    This option allows you to store builds elsewhere, which can be useful with finer-grained backup policies, or to store the build data on a faster disk such as an SSD.
    The following placeholders are supported for this value:

    * `${JENKINS_HOME}`  – Resolves to the Jenkins home directory.
    * `${ITEM_ROOTDIR}` – The directory containing the job metadata within Jenkins home.
    * `${ITEM_FULL_NAME}` – The full name of the item, with file system unsafe characters replaced by others.
    * `${ITEM_FULLNAME}` – See above, but does not replace unsafe characters. This is a legacy option and should not be used.

    For instance, if you would like to store builds outside of Jenkins home, you can use a value like the following: `/some_other_root/builds/${ITEM_FULL_NAME}` This used to be a UI setting, but was removed in 2.119 as it did not support migration of existing build records and could lead to build-related errors until restart.

= Jenkins Features Controlled with System Properties

Jenkins has several "hidden" features that can be enabled with system properties.
This page documents many of them and explain how to configure them on your instance.

Some system properties related to the Remoting library used for communication between master and agents are documented in https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting/blob/master/docs/configuration.md[that component's repository].

== Usage

System properties are defined by passing `-Dproperty=value` to the `java` command line to start Jenkins.
Make sure to pass all of these arguments *before* the `-jar` argument, otherwise they will be ignored.
Example:

```sh
java -Dhudson.footerURL=http://example.org -jar jenkins.war
```

The following lists the properties and the version of Jenkins they were introduced in.

* `*Property*` - Java property name
* *Default* - Default value if not explicitly set
* *Since* - The version of Jenkins the property was introduced in
* *Description* - Other notes

=== Compatibility

We do **NOT** guarantee that system properties will remain unchanged and functional indefinitely.
These switches are often experimental in nature, and subject to change without notice.
If you find these useful, please file a ticket to promote it to an official feature.


== Properties in Jenkins Core

[NOTE]
Due to the very large number of system properties used, often just added as a "safety valve" or "escape hatch" in case a change causes problems, this is list is not expected to be complete.
