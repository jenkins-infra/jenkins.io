= Manage Users

== Setting up User Accounts -

As soon as we set up Jenkins in our local computers and go to the required TCP port 
we set during installation, we get to see the following page where we can enter our
details as a first time user

== Manage Jenkins -

Now once the creation of user account is done after filling all the details correctly
we are all set to use Jenkins 
Now after signing into Jenkins, on the left side of the screen we can see a panel of
options including the ones shown below
From here we can see multiple options under different sections. From there we will head
over to *Security* section where we can find *Manage Users* option. This option can be
utilized to *Create/Delete/Modify* details of users who signed into Jenkins.

== Configure User Details -

After clicking on that option, we can see a list of users and we need to click on the 
user id whose details need to be altered. Now on the left side again we see a "Configure"
option on the left panel.
In this section we have multiple options to add/update our details including Name, 
Description, API Token, Credentials, E-mail, Views, Notification URL, Password, 
SSH Public Keys, Session Termination option, Time Zone
