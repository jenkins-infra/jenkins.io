= Managing Users

Managing users in Jenkins involves creating, configuring, and maintaining user accounts for individuals who interact with the Jenkins instance. This page provides a step-by-step guide on how to manage users effectively.

== What Managing Users Means

In Jenkins, managing users refers to the process of creating, configuring, and maintaining user accounts. This includes:

- Creating new users.
- Configuring user details (e.g., full name, email address, password).
- Modifying user information.
- Deleting users.

Administrators with the appropriate permissions can perform these actions.

== Accessing the Manage Users Page

To manage users in Jenkins, you need to have administrative privileges. Follow these steps to access the user management section:

. Log in to your Jenkins instance with an account that has administrative permissions.
+
. Navigate to the **Manage Jenkins** page from the Jenkins dashboard.

== Modifying User Information

Administrators can modify user information at any time:

. Navigate to the **Manage Users** page.
+
. Click on the user whose information you want to modify.
+
. Update the relevant fields (e.g., full name, email address, password).
+
. Click **Save** to apply the changes.
+

== Deleting a User

To remove a user from Jenkins:

. Navigate to **Manage Users**.
+
. Find the user you want to delete.
+
. Click on the **Delete** button next to the user’s name.
+

. Confirm the deletion.
+

⚠️ **Note:** Deleting a user **permanently removes their account** from Jenkins. Make sure they don't have active jobs or responsibilities before proceeding.

== Linking to Security Settings

User management is closely tied to Jenkins' security settings. For more information on configuring permissions and authorization, refer to the link:../managing/security.adoc#authorization[Managing Security - Authorization] documentation.

== Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues you may encounter while managing users:

- **User creation fails:** Ensure that all required fields are filled and the username is unique.
- **User permissions are incorrect:** Check the security settings under *Manage Jenkins > Configure Global Security*.
- **Cannot delete a user:** If a user is associated with active jobs, consider disabling their account instead of deleting it.

== Conclusion

Managing users in Jenkins is a straightforward process that involves creating users, configuring their settings, and ensuring they have the appropriate permissions. By following this guide, you can effectively manage users in your Jenkins instance.
