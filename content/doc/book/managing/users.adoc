= Users

Managing users in Jenkins involves creating, configuring, and maintaining user accounts for individuals who interact with the Jenkins instance. This page provides a step-by-step guide on how to manage users effectively.

_Jenkins supports external authentication systems like GitHub, GitLab, Google, and LDAP. If an external authentication method is configured, user management may be handled outside Jenkins. This guide applies only when using Jenkins' **internal user database**._

== What managing users means

In Jenkins, managing users refers to the process of creating, configuring, and maintaining user accounts. This includes:

- Creating new users.
- Configuring user details such as full name, email address, and password.
- Modifying user information.
- Deleting users.

Administrators with the appropriate permissions can perform these actions.

== Accessing the users page

To manage users in Jenkins, you need to have administrative privileges. Follow these steps to access the user management section:

. Log in to your Jenkins instance with an account that has administrative permissions.
+
. Navigate to the **Manage Jenkins** page from the Jenkins dashboard.

. Fill in the required details:
   - **Username**: A unique identifier for the user.
   - **Password**: A secure password for the user.
   - **Confirm Password**: Re-enter the password.
   - **Full Name**: The full name of the user.
   - **Email Address**: The email address of the user.

   - **Full Name**: Edit the user's full name.
   - **Description**: Update the user's description.
   - **Credentials**: Change the user's credentials.

. Select **Save** to apply the changes.
== Modifying user information

Administrators can modify user information at any time:

. Navigate to the **Manage Users** page.
+
. Select the user whose information you want to modify.
+
. Update the relevant fields such as full name, email address, or password.
+
. Select **Save** to apply the changes.

== Deleting a user

To remove a user from Jenkins, there are two approaches. Let’s explore both of them:

=== First approach

. Navigate to **Users**.
+
. Find the user you want to delete.
+
. Select the **Delete** option next to the user’s name.
+

+

. Confirm the deletion.

=== Second approach

. Navigate to **Manage Jenkins**.
+
. Then navigate to **Users**.
+
. Select the trash icon on the right-most side of the user you want to delete.
+

+

. Confirm the deletion.

WARNING: Deleting a user **permanently removes their account** from Jenkins. Make sure they don't have active jobs or responsibilities before proceeding.

== Linking to security settings

User management is closely tied to Jenkins' security settings. For more information on configuring permissions and authorization, refer to the link:/doc/book/security/access-control/permissions/[Access Control - Permissions] documentation.

== Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues you may encounter while managing users:

- **User creation fails:** Ensure that all required fields are filled and the username is unique.
- **User permissions are incorrect:** Check the security settings under *Manage Jenkins > Configure Global Security*.
- **Cannot delete a user:** If a user is associated with active jobs, consider disabling their account instead of deleting it.

== Conclusion

Managing users in Jenkins is a straightforward process that involves creating users, configuring their settings, and ensuring they have the appropriate permissions. By following this guide, you can effectively manage users in your Jenkins instance.
