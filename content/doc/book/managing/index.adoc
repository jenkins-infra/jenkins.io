= Managing Jenkins

This chapter cover how to manage and configure Jenkins masters and nodes.

This chapter is intended for Jenkins administrators. More experienced users may find
this information useful, but only to the extent that they will understand what is and is not possible
for administrators to do.  Individual sections may assume knowledge of information
from previous sections, but such assumptions will be explicitly called out and cross-referenced.

If you are not yet familiar with basic Jenkins terminology and features, start with
<<getting-started#,Getting Started with Jenkins>>.

If you are already familiar with Jenkins basics and would like to delve deeper into how to use specific features, see
<<using#,Using Jenkins>>.

If you are a system administrator and want learn how to back-up, restore, maintain as Jenkins servers and nodes, see
<<operating#,Operating Jenkins>>.
