= Managing Jenkins

Most standard administrative tasks can be performed from the screens
in the *Manage Jenkins* section of the dashboard.
In this chapter, we look at these screens and explain how to use them.

The tiles displayed on the *Manage Jenkins* page are grouped logically.
Here we discuss the pages that are part of the standard installation.
Plugins may add pages to this screen.

The top of the *Manage Jenkins* screen may contain "Monitors"
that alert you when a new version
of the Jenkins software or a security update is available.
Each monitor includes a description of the issue it is reporting and links to additional information about the issue

Inline help is available on most *Manage Jenkins* pages:

* To access the help, select the `?` icon to the right of each field.
* Click the `?` icon again to hide the help text.

Other system administration topics are discussed in
<<system-administration#,Jenkins System Administration>>.

image:managing/prepare-for-shutdown.png[Red headband with a custom message]

[NOTE]
This does not ask Jenkins to stop; this action will just prevent new builds from starting.
If you need to stop or restart Jenkins, you should use the command line or the `/restart` and `/safeRestart` end points.
There is also a plugin called https://plugins.jenkins.io/saferestart/[Safe Restart] that will add a `Restart Safely` link in the UI.

== Uncategorized group

Screens for plugins that have not yet declared the category of their page.
