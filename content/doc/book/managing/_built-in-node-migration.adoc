// Included in other files because we need it in multiple locations

As part of the link:https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-dev/c/x5vdlJDvntw[terminology cleanup effort], the built-in node was renamed from "master node" to "built-in node" in Jenkins 2.307 and in Jenkins 2.319.1.
This is not just a change affecting the UI and documentation:
The node name affects the implicitly assigned label of the node (and consequently the `NODE_LABELS` environment variable), as well as the `NODE_NAME` environment variable.

NOTE: The `NODE_NAME` environment variable in Pipelines is set by the plugin:workflow-durable-task-step[Pipeline: Nodes and Processes] plugin.
In plugin version 2.39 and earlier, this value is always `master`. Update to version 2.40 or newer to get consistent behavior between job types.

== Affected Features

Jenkins features using node labels are therefore potentially impacted by any such changes.
These features include:

* Label assignments of various project types, both on the top level (e.g. Freestyle jobs) and within jobs (e.g. `node` statements in Scripted Pipeline, `label` parameters to `agent` sections in Declarative Pipeline, or plugin:matrix-project[Matrix Project] axes).
* Label assignments of features like custom tool auto-installers, typically used to distinguish OS platforms.
* Any custom build scripts whose behavior is different based on the `NODE_NAME` or `NODE_LABELS` environment variables
(or their `env` global variable equivalent in Pipeline).
* Any similar features in plugins.

== Migration

Due to the potential impact to build behavior, instances upgrading Jenkins to version 2.307 or newer do not automatically get these behavior changes applied.
Instead, an administrative monitor informs administrators about this change and allows them to apply it.

// Screenshot here? Is this useful?

Before applying the built-in node name and label migration, administrators are advised to review their configuration and build scripts to assess the impact to their instance and jobs.

Most problems with label assignments can likely be worked around by manually assigning the label `master` to the built-in node and then migrating affected configuration incrementally to not need this workaround.

== Plugin Compatibility

=== Known Incompatible Plugins

* plugin:workflow-durable-task-step[Pipeline: Nodes and Processes] always sets the `NODE_NAME` to `master` in Pipelines before link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-durable-task-step-plugin/releases/tag/workflow-durable-task-step-2.40[version 2.40].
* plugin:nodelabelparameter[Node and Label Parameter plugin] displays the controller node as `master` in releases before link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/nodelabelparameter-plugin/releases/tag/nodelabelparameter-1.10.0[version 1.10.0].

=== Reporting Incompatible Plugins

Please report problems in the respective plugin's issue tracker.

If the affected plugin uses the Jenkins Jira to track issues, please add the label `built-in-node-migration-regression`.

If the affected plugin tracks issues on GitHub, please make sure to mention the https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5425[Jenkins pull request] that implemented the change in your issue.
