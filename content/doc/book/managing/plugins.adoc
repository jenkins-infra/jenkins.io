Plugins are the primary means of enhancing the functionality of a Jenkins
environment to suit organization- or user-specific needs. There are
link:https://plugins.jenkins.io[over a thousand different plugins]
which can be installed on a Jenkins master and to integrate various
build tools, cloud providers, analysis tools, and much more.

Plugins can be automatically downloaded, with their dependencies, from the
<<../glossary#update-center,Update Center>>. The Update Center is a service
operated by the Jenkins project which provides an inventory of open source
plugins which have been developed and maintained by various members of the
Jenkins community.

This section will cover everything from the basics of managing plugins within
the Jenkins web UI, to making changes on the <<../glossary#master,master's>>
file system.

== Installing a plugin

Jenkins provides a couple of different methods for installing plugins on the master:

. Using the "Plugin Manager" in the web UI.
. Using the <<install-with-cli,Jenkins CLI>> `install-plugin` command.

Each approach will result in the plugin being loaded by Jenkins but may require
different levels of access and trade-offs in order to use.

The two approaches require that the Jenkins master be able to download
meta-data from an Update Center, whether the primary Update Center operated by
the Jenkins project
footnoteref:[uc, https://updates.jenkins.io],
or a custom Update Center.

The plugins are packaged as self-contained `.hpi` files, which have all the
necessary code, images, and other resources which the plugin needs to operate
successfully.

=== From the web UI

The simplest and most common way of installing plugins is through the
*Manage Jenkins* > *Manage Plugins* view, available to administrators of a
Jenkins environment.

Under the *Available* tab, plugins available for download from the configured
Update Center can be searched and considered:

image::managing/plugin-manager-available.png["Available tab in the Plugin Manager", role=center]

Most plugins can be installed and used immediately by checking the box adjacent
to the plugin and clicking *Install without restart*.


[CAUTION]
====
If the list of available plugins is empty, the master might be incorrectly
configured or has not yet downloaded plugin meta-data from the Update Center.
Clicking the *Check now* button will force Jenkins to attempt to contact its
configured Update Center.

[[install-with-cli]]
=== Using the Jenkins CLI

Administrators may also use the <<cli#,Jenkins CLI>> which provides a command
to install plugins. Scripts to manage Jenkins environments, or configuration
management code, may need to install plugins without direct user interaction in
the web UI. The Jenkins CLI allows a command line user or automation tool to
download a plugin and its dependencies.

[source]
----
java -jar jenkins-cli.jar -s http://localhost:8080/ install-plugin SOURCE ... [-deploy] [-name VAL] [-restart]

Installs a plugin either from a file, an URL, or from update center.

 SOURCE    : If this points to a local file, that file will be installed. If
             this is an URL, Jenkins downloads the URL and installs that as a
             plugin.Otherwise the name is assumed to be the short name of the
             plugin in the existing update center (like "findbugs"),and the
             plugin will be installed from the update center.
 -deploy   : Deploy plugins right away without postponing them until the reboot.
 -name VAL : If specified, the plugin will be installed as this short name
             (whereas normally the name is inferred from the source name
             automatically).
 -restart  : Restart Jenkins upon successful installation.
----


=== Advanced installation

The Update Center only allows the installation of the most recently released
version of a plugin. In cases where an older release of the plugin is desired,
a Jenkins administrator can download an older `.hpi` archive and manually
install that on the Jenkins master.

==== From the web UI

Assuming a `.hpi` file has been downloaded, a logged-in Jenkins administrator
may upload the file from within the web UI:

. Navigate to the *Manage Jenkins* > *Manage Plugins* page in the web UI.
. Click on the *Advanced* tab.
. Choose the `.hpi` file under the *Upload Plugin* section.
. *Upload* the plugin file.

image::managing/plugin-manager-upload.png["Advanced tab in the Plugin Manager", role=center]

Once a plugin file has been uploaded, the Jenkins master must be manually
restarted in order for the changes to take effect.

==== On the master

Assuming a `.hpi` file has been explicitly downloaded by a systems
administrator, the administrator can manually place the `.hpi` file in a
specific location on the file system.

Copy the downloaded `.hpi`` file into the `JENKINS_HOME/plugins` directory on
the Jenkins master (for example, on Debian systems `JENKINS_HOME` is generally
`/var/lib/jenkins`).

The master will need to be restarted before the plugin is loaded and
made available in the Jenkins environment.

[NOTE]
====
The names of the plugin directories in the Update Site footnoteref:[uc] are
not always the same as the plugin's display name. Searching
link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/[plugins.jenkins.io]
for the desired plugin will provide the appropriate link to the `.hpi` files.
====

== Updating a plugin

Updates are listed in the *Updates* tab of the *Manage Plugins* page and can be
installed by checking the checkboxes of the desired plugin updates and clicking
the *Download now and install after restart* button.

image::managing/plugin-manager-update.png["Updates tab in the Plugin Manager", role=center]
By default, the Jenkins master will check for updates from the Update Center
once every 24 hours. To manually trigger a check for updates, simply click on
the *Check now* button in the *Updates* tab.

== Removing a plugin

When a plugin is no longer used in a Jenkins environment, it is prudent to
remove the plugin from the Jenkins master. This provides a number of benefits
such as reducing memory overhead at boot or runtime, reducing configuration
options in the web UI, and removing the potential for future conflicts with new
plugin updates.

=== Uninstalling a plugin

The simplest way to uninstall a plugin is to navigate to the *Installed* tab on
the *Manage Plugins* page. From there, Jenkins will automatically determine
which plugins are safe to uninstall, those which are not dependencies of other
plugins, and present a button for doing so.

image::managing/plugin-manager-uninstall.png["Installed tab in the Plugin Manager", role=center]


A plugin may also be uninstalled by removing the corresponding `.hpi`
file from the `JENKINS_HOME/plugins` directory on the master. The plugin will
continue to function until the master has been restarted.

[CAUTION]
====
If a plugin `.hpi` file is removed but required by other plugins, the Jenkins
master may fail to boot correctly.
====

Uninstalling a plugin does *not* remove the configuration that the plugin may
have created. If there are existing jobs/nodes/views/builds/etc configurations
that reference data created by the plugin, during boot Jenkins will warn that
some configurations could not be fully loaded and ignore the unrecognized data.

Since the configuration(s) will be preserved until they are overwritten,
re-installing the plugin will result in those configuration values reappearing.

==== Removing old data

Jenkins provides a facility for purging configuration left behind by
uninstalled plugins. Navigate to *Manage Jenkins* and then click on *Manage
Old Data* to review and remove old data.

=== Disabling a plugin

Disabling a plugin is a softer way to retire a plugin. Jenkins will continue to
recognize that the plugin is installed, but it will not start the plugin, and
no extensions contributed from this plugin will be visible.

A Jenkins administrator may disable a plugin by unchecking the box on the
*Installed* tab of the *Manage Plugins* page (see below).

image::managing/plugin-manager-disable.png["Installed tab in the Plugin Manager", role=center]


A systems administrator may also disable a plugin by creating a file on the
Jenkins master, such as: `JENKINS_HOME/plugins/PLUGIN_NAME.hpi.disabled`.

The configuration(s) created by the disabled plugin behave as if the plugin
were uninstalled, insofar that they result in warnings on boot but are
otherwise ignored.


== Pinned plugins

[CAUTION]
====
Pinned plugins feature was removed in Jenkins 2.0. Versions later than Jenkins
2.0 do not bundle plugins, instead providing a wizard to install the most
useful plugins.
====

The notion of *pinned plugins* applies to plugins that are bundled with
Jenkins 1.x, such as the
plugin:matrix-auth[*Matrix Authorization plugin*].

By default, whenever Jenkins is upgraded, its bundled plugins overwrite the
versions of the plugins that are currently installed in `JENKINS_HOME`.

However, when a bundled plugin has been manually updated, Jenkins will mark
that plugin as pinned to the particular version. On the file system, Jenkins
creates an empty file called `JENKINS_HOME/plugins/PLUGIN_NAME.hpi.pinned`
to indicate the pinning.

Pinned plugins will never be overwritten by bundled plugins during Jenkins
startup. (Newer versions of Jenkins do warn you if a pinned plugin is _older_
than what is currently bundled.)

It is safe to update a bundled plugin to a version offered by the Update
Center. This is often necessary to pick up the newest features and fixes. The
bundled version is occasionally updated, but not consistently.

The Plugin Manager allows plugins to be explicitly unpinned. The
`JENKINS_HOME/plugins/PLUGIN_NAME.hpi.pinned` file can also be manually
created/deleted to control the pinning behavior. If the `pinned` file is
present, Jenkins will use whatever plugin version the user has specified.
If the file is absent, Jenkins will restore the plugin to the default version
on startup.
