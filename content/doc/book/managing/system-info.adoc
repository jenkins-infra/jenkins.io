== Memory usage

This section presents a graphical representation of the controller's memory usage, categorized into three timespans for better analysis:

- **Short-term**: Covers memory usage over the last few seconds/minutes for real-time monitoring.

- **Medium-term**: Displays memory trends over the past hour/minutes, useful for detecting gradual memory leaks.

- **Long-term**: Illustrates extended memory usage patterns over a day or month to identify recurring issues.

This breakdown allows administrators to monitor memory trends, detect unusual spikes, and optimize resource allocation.

== Thread dump

The **Thread Dump** section captures a real-time snapshot of all active threads running in the Jenkins controllerâ€™s JVM. This is essential for diagnosing performance issues, deadlocks, or excessive CPU utilization. Each thread entry includes:

- **Name**: Thread identifier.
- **ID**: Unique thread ID.
- **State**: Current execution state (e.g., RUNNABLE, TIMED_WAITING, BLOCKED).
- **Stack Trace**: The call sequence leading to the current state.
