== Memory usage

The *Memory Usage* section provides a graphical representation of the controller's memory usage, categorized into three timespans for better analysis:

- **Short**: The short timespan covers memory usage over the last few minutes, broken down by seconds, for real-time monitoring.

- **Medium**: The medium timespan displays memory trends over the past hour, broken down by minutes, which is useful for detecting gradual memory leaks.

- **Long**: The long timespan illustrates extended memory usage patterns over a day or month to identify recurring issues.
This breakdown allows administrators to monitor memory trends, detect unusual spikes, and optimize resource allocation.

== Thread dump

The **Thread Dump** section provides a link to a page that captures a real-time snapshot of all active threads running in the Jenkins controllerâ€™s JVM. This is essential for diagnosing performance issues, deadlocks, or excessive CPU utilization.

Each thread entry includes:

. **Name**: The thread identifier.
. **ID**: The unique thread ID.
. **State**: The current execution state (RUNNABLE, TIMED_WAITING, BLOCKED).
. **Stack Trace**: The call sequence leading to the current state.
