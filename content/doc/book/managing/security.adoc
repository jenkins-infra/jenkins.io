Jenkins is used everywhere from workstations on corporate intranets, to
high-powered servers connected to the public internet. To safely support this
wide spread of security and threat profiles, Jenkins offers many configuration
options for enabling, editing, or disabling various security features.

As of Jenkins 2.0, many of the security options were enabled by default to
ensure that Jenkins environments remained secure unless an administrator
explicitly disabled certain protections.

This section will introduce the various security options available to a Jenkins
administrator, explaining the protections offered, and trade-offs to disabling
some of them.


== Enabling Security

When the *Enable Security* checkbox is checked, which has been the default
since Jenkins 2.0, users can log in with a username and password in order to
perform operations not available to anonymous users. Which operations require
users to log in depends on the chosen authorization strategy and its configuration;
by default anonymous users have no permissions, and logged in users have full
control. This checkbox should *always* be enabled for any non-local (test) Jenkins
environment.

The Enable Security section of the web UI allows a Jenkins administrator to
enable, configure, or disable key security features which apply to the entire
Jenkins environment.

=== JNLP TCP Port

Jenkins uses a TCP port to communicate with agents launched via the JNLP
protocol, such as Windows-based agents. As of Jenkins 2.0, by default this port
is disabled.

For administrators wishing to use JNLP-based agents, the two port options are:


. *Random*: The JNLP port is chosen random to avoid collisions on the Jenkins
  <<../glossary#master,master>>. The downside to randomized JNLP ports is that
  they're chosen during the boot of the Jenkins master, making it difficult to
  manage firewall rules allowing JNLP traffic.
. *Fixed*: The JNLP port is chosen by the Jenkins administrator and is
  consistent across reboots of the Jenkins master. This makes it easier to manage
  firewall rules allowing JNLP-based agents to connect to the master.


=== Access Control

Access Control is the primary mechanism for securing a Jenkins environment
against unauthorized usage. Two facets of configuration are necessary for
configuring Access Control in Jenkins:

. A *Security Realm* which informs the Jenkins environment how and where to
  pull user (or identity) information from. Also commonly known as "authentication."
. *Authorization* configuration which informs the Jenkins environment as to
  which users and/or groups can access which aspects of Jenkins, and to what
  extent.


Using both the Security Realm and Authorization configurations it is possible
to configure very relaxed or very rigid authentication and authorization
schemes in Jenkins.

Additionally, some plugins such as the
plugin:role-strategy[Role-based Authorization Strategy]
plugin can extend the Access Control capabilities of Jenkins to support even
more nuanced authentication and authorization schemes.


==== Security Realm

By default Jenkins includes support for a few different Security Realms:

Delegate to servlet container:: For delegating authentication a servlet
container running the Jenkins master, such as
link:https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/[Jetty]. If using this option, please consult
the servlet container's authentication documentation.
Jenkins’ own user database:: Use Jenkins's own built-in user data store for
authentication instead of delegating to an external system. This is enabled by
default with new Jenkins 2.0 or later installations and is suitable for smaller
environments.
LDAP:: Delegate all authentication to a configured LDAP server, including both
users and groups. This option is more common for larger installations in
organizations which already have configured an external identity provider such
as LDAP. This also supports Active Directory installations.


[NOTE]
====
This feature is provided by the plugin:ldap[LDAP plugin]
that may not be installed on your instance.
====

Unix user/group database:: Delegates the authentication to the underlying Unix
OS-level user database on the Jenkins master. This mode will also allow re-use
of Unix groups for authorization. For example, Jenkins can be configured such
that "Everyone in the `developers` group has administrator access." To support this feature, Jenkins relies on
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluggable_Authentication_Modules[PAM]
which may need to be configured external to the Jenkins environment.


[CAUTION]
====
Unix allows an user and a group to have the same name. In order to
disambiguate, use the `@` prefix to force the name to be interpreted as
a group. For example, `@dev` would mean the `dev` group and not the `dev` user.
====

---


Plugins can provide additional security realms which may be useful for
incorporating Jenkins into existing identity systems, such as:

* plugin:active-directory[Active Directory]
* plugin:github-oauth[GitHub Authentication]
* plugin:crowd2[Atlassian Crowd 2]

==== Authorization


The Security Realm, or authentication, indicates _who_ can access the Jenkins
environment. The other piece of the puzzle is *Authorization*, which indicates
_what_ they can access in the Jenkins environment. By default Jenkins supports
a few different Authorization options:


Anyone can do anything:: Everyone gets full control of Jenkins, including
anonymous users who haven't logged in. *Do not use this setting* for anything
other than local test Jenkins masters.
Legacy mode:: Behaves exactly the same as Jenkins <1.164. Namely, if a user has
the "admin" role, they will be granted full control over the system, and otherwise
(including anonymous users) will only have the read access. *Do not use this
setting* for anything other than local test Jenkins masters.
Logged in users can do anything:: In this mode, every logged-in user gets full
control of Jenkins. Depending on an advanced option, anonymous users get read
access to Jenkins, or no access at all. This mode is useful to force users to
log in before taking actions, so that there is an audit trail of users' actions.
Matrix-based security:: This authorization scheme allows for granular control
over which users and groups are able to perform which actions in the Jenkins
environment (see the screenshot below).
Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy:: This authorization scheme is an
extension to Matrix-based security which allows additional access control lists
(ACLs) to be defined for *each project* separately in the Project configuration
screen. This allows granting specific users or groups access only to specified
projects, instead of all projects in the Jenkins environment. The ACLs defined
with Project-based Matrix Authorization are additive such that access grants
defined in the Configure Global Security screen will be combined with
project-specific ACLs.

[NOTE]
====
Matrix-based security and Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy are provided
by the plugin:matrix-auth[Matrix Authorization Strategy Plugin]
and may not be installed on your Jenkins.
====


For most Jenkins environments, Matrix-based security provides the most security
and flexibility so it is recommended as a starting point for "production"
environments.

.Matrix-based security
image::managing/configure-global-security-matrix-authorization.png["Configure Global Security - Enable Security - Matrix authorization", role=center]


The table shown above can get quite wide as each column represents a permission
provided by Jenkins core or a plugin. Hovering the mouse over a permission will
display more information about the permission.

Each row in the table represents a user or group (also known as a "role"). This
includes special entries named "anonymous" and "authenticated." The "anonymous"
entry represents permissions granted to all unauthenticated users accessing the
Jenkins environment. Whereas "authenticated' can be used to grant permissions
to all authenticated users accessing the environment.

The permissions granted in the matrix are additive. For example, if a user
"kohsuke" is in the groups "developers" and "administrators", then the
permissions granted to "kohsuke" will be a union of all those permissions
granted to "kohsuke", "developers", "administrators", "authenticated", and
"anonymous."

=== Markup Formatter

Jenkins allows user-input in a number of different configuration fields and
text areas which can lead to users inadvertently, or maliciously, inserting
unsafe HTML and/or JavaScript.

By default the *Markup Formatter* configuration is set to *Plain Text* which
will escape unsafe characters such as `<` and `&` to their respective character
entities.

Using the *Safe HTML* Markup Formatter allows for users and
administrators to inject useful and information HTML snippets into Project
Descriptions and elsewhere.

== Cross Site Request Forgery

A cross site request forgery (or CSRF/XSRF)
footnoteref:[csrf, https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery]
is an exploit that enables an unauthorized third party to perform requests
against a web application by impersonating another, authenticated, user. In the
context of a Jenkins environment, a CSRF attack could allow an malicious actor
to delete projects, alter builds, or modify Jenkins' system configuration. To
guard against this class of vulnerabilities, CSRF protection has been enabled
by default with all Jenkins versions since 2.0.

image::managing/configure-global-security-prevent-csrf.png["Configure Global Security - Prevent Cross Site Request Forgery exploits", role=center]

When the option is enabled, Jenkins will check for a CSRF token, or "crumb",
on any request that may change data in the Jenkins environment. This includes
any form submission and calls to the remote API, including those using "Basic"
authentication.

It is *strongly recommended* that this option be left *enabled*, including on
instances operating on private, fully trusted networks.

=== Caveats

CSRF protection _may_ result in challenges for more advanced usages of Jenkins,
such as:

* Some Jenkins features, like the remote API, are more difficult to use when
  this option is enabled. Consult the <<../using/remote-api#csrf, Remote API>>
  documentation for more information.
* Accessing Jenkins through a poorly-configured reverse proxy may result in the
  CSRF HTTP header being stripped from requests, resulting in protected actions
  failing.
* Out-dated plugins, not tested with CSRF protection enabled, may not properly
  function.

More information about CSRF exploits can be found
link:https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery[on the OWASP
website].


== Agent/Master Access Control

Conceptually, the Jenkins master and agents can be thought of as a cohesive
system which happens to execute across multiple discrete processes and
machines. This allows an agent to ask the master process for information
available to it, for example, the contents of files, etc.

For larger or mature Jenkins environments where a Jenkins administrator might
enable agents provided by other teams or organizations, a flat agent/master
trust model is insufficient.

The Agent/Master Access Control system was introduced
footnote:[Starting with 1.587, and 1.580.1, releases]
to allow Jenkins administrators to add more granular access control definitions
between the Jenkins master and the connected agents.

image::managing/configure-global-security-enable-agent-master.png["Configure Global Security - Enable Agent => Master Access Control", role=center]

As of Jenkins 2.0, this subsystem has been turned on by default.

=== Customizing Access

For advanced users who may wish to allow certain access patterns from the
agents to the Jenkins master, Jenkins allows administrators to create specific
exemptions from the built-in access control rules.

image::managing/configure-global-security-access-control-rules.png["Configure Global Security - Enable Agent => Master Access Control - Editing Rules", role=center]

By following the link highlighted above, an administrator may edit *Commands*
and *File Access* Agent/Master access control rules.


==== Commands

"Commands" in Jenkins and its plugins are identified by their fully-qualified
class names. The majority of these commands are intended to be executed on
agents by a request of a master, but some of them are intended to be executed
on a master by a request of an agent.

Plugins not yet updated for this subsystem may not classify which category each
command falls into, such that when an agent requests that the master execute a
command which is not explicitly allowed, Jenkins will err on the side of
caution and refuse to execute the command.

In such cases, Jenkins administrators may "whitelist"
footnote:[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitelist]
certain commands as acceptable for execution on the master.

image::managing/configure-global-security-whitelist-commands.png["Configure Global Security - Enable Agent => Master Access Control - Editing Rules - Command Whitelisting", role=center]

===== Advanced

Administrators may also whitelist classes by creating files with the `.conf`
extension in the directory `JENKINS_HOME/secrets/whitelisted-callables.d/`.
The contents of these `.conf` files should list command names on separate
lines.

The contents of all the `.conf` files in the directory will be read by Jenkins
and combined to create a `default.conf` file in the directory which lists all
known safe command. The `default.conf` file will be re-written each time
Jenkins boots.


Jenkins also manages a file named `gui.conf`, in the `whitelisted-callables.d`
directory, where commands added via the web UI are written. In order to disable
the ability of administrators to change whitelisted commands from the web UI,
place an empty `gui.conf` file in the directory and change its permissions such
that is not writeable by the operating system user Jenkins run as.

==== File Access Rules

The File Access Rules are used to validate file access requests made from
agents to the master. Each File Access Rule is a triplet which must contain each
of the following elements:


. `allow` / `deny`: if the following two parameters match the current request
  being considered, an `allow` entry would allow the request to be carried out
  and a `deny` entry would deny the request to be rejected, regardless of what
  later rules might say.
. _operation_: Type of the operation requested. The following 6 values exist.
  The operations can also be combined by comma-separating the values. The value
  of `all` indicates all the listed operations are allowed or denied.
** `read`: read file content or list directory entries
** `write`: write file content
** `mkdirs`: create a new directory
** `create`: create a file in an existing directory
** `delete`: delete a file or directory
** `stat`: read metadata of a file/directory, such as timestamp, length, file access modes.
. _file path_: regular expression that specifies file paths that matches this
  rule. In addition to the base regexp syntax, it supports the following
  tokens:
** `<JENKINS_HOME>` can be used as a prefix to match the master's
   `JENKINS_HOME` directory.
** `<BUILDDIR>` can be used as a prefix to match the build record directory,
    such as `/var/lib/jenkins/job/foo/builds/2014-10-17_12-34-56`.
** `<BUILDID>` matches the timestamp-formatted build IDs, like
    `2014-10-17_12-34-56`.

The rules are ordered, and applied in that order. The earliest match wins.
For example, the following rules allow access to all files in `JENKINS_HOME`
except the `secrets` folders:

[source]
----
# To avoid hassle of escaping every '\' on Windows, you can use / even on Windows.
deny all <JENKINS_HOME>/secrets/.*
allow all <JENKINS_HOME>/.*
----

Ordering is very important! The following rules are incorrectly written because
the 2nd rule will never match, and allow all agents to access all files and
folders under `JENKINS_HOME`:

[source]
----
allow all <JENKINS_HOME>/.*
deny all <JENKINS_HOME>/secrets/.*
----

===== Advanced

Administrators may also add File Access Rules by creating files with the
`.conf.` extension in the directory `JENKINS_HOME/secrets/filepath-filters.d/`.
Jenkins itself generates the `30-default.conf` file on boot in this directory
which contains defaults considered the best balance between compatibility and
security by the Jenkins project. In order to disable these built-in defaults,
replace `30-default.conf` with an empty file which is not writable by the
operating system user Jenkins run as.

On each boot, Jenkins will read all `.conf` files in the `filepath-filters.d`
directory in alphabetical order, therefore it is good practice to name files in a
manner which indicates their load order.

Jenkins also manages `50-gui.conf`, in the `filepath-filters/` directory, where
File Access Rules added via the web UI are written. In order to disable the
ability of administrators to change the File Access Rules from the web UI,
place an empty `50-gui.conf` file in the directory and change its permissions
such that is not writeable by the operating system user Jenkins run as.

=== Disabling

While it is not recommended, if all agents in a Jenkins environment can be
considered "trusted" to the same degree that the master is trusted, the
Agent/Master Access Control feature may be disabled.

Additionally, all the users in the Jenkins environment should have the same
level of access to all configured projects.

An administrator can disable Agent/Master Access Control in the web UI by
un-checking the box on the *Configure Global Security* page. Alternatively an
administrator may create a file in `JENKINS_HOME/secrets` named
`slave-to-master-security-kill-switch` with the contents of `true` and restart
Jenkins.

[CAUTION]
====
Most Jenkins environments grow over time requiring their trust models to evolve
as the environment grows. Please consider scheduling regular "check-ups" to
review whether any disabled security settings should be re-enabled.
