Jenkins has a built-in command line interface that allows users and
administrators to access Jenkins from a script or shell environment. This can
be convenient for scripting of routine tasks, bulk updates, troubleshooting,
and more.

The command line interface can be accessed over SSH or with the Jenkins CLI
client, a `.jar` file distributed with Jenkins.

[WARNING]
====
Use of the CLI client distributed with Jenkins 2.53 and older and Jenkins LTS 2.46.1 and older
is **not recommended** for security reasons:
while there are no currently known vulnerabilities,
several have been reported and patched in the past,
and the Jenkins Remoting protocol it uses is inherently vulnerable to remote code execution bugs,
even “preauthentication” exploits (by anonymous users able to physically access the Jenkins network).

The client distributed with Jenkins 2.54 and newer and Jenkins LTS 2.46.2 and newer
is considered secure in its default (`-http`) or `-ssh` modes,
as is using the standard `ssh` command.
====

[[ssh]]
== Using the CLI over SSH

In a new Jenkins installation, the SSH service is disabled by default.
Administrators may choose to set a specific port or ask Jenkins to pick a random port
in the <<security#ssh-server, Configure Global Security>> page.
In order to determine the randomly assigned SSH port,
inspect the headers returned on a Jenkins URL, for example:

[source]
----
% curl -Lv https://JENKINS_URL/login 2>&1 | grep 'X-SSH-Endpoint'
< X-SSH-Endpoint: localhost:53801
%
----

With the random SSH port (`53801` in this example), and <<Authentication>>
configured, any modern SSH client may securely execute CLI commands.

=== Authentication

Whichever user used for authentication with the Jenkins master must have the
`Overall/Read` permission in order to _access_ the CLI. The user may require
additional permissions depending on the commands executed.

Authentication relies on
SSH-based public/private key authentication. In order to add an SSH public key
for the appropriate user, navigate to
`https://JENKINS_URL/user/USERNAME/configure` and paste an SSH public key
into the appropriate text area.

=== Common Commands

Jenkins has a number of built-in CLI commands which can be found in every
Jenkins environment, such as `build` or `list-jobs`. Plugins may also provide
CLI commands; in order to determine the full list of commands available
in a given Jenkins environment, execute the CLI `help` command:

[source]
----
% ssh -l kohsuke -p 53801 localhost help
----

The following list of commands is not comprehensive, but it is a useful
starting point for Jenkins CLI usage.

==== build

One of the most common and useful CLI commands is `build`, which allows the
user to trigger any job or Pipeline for which they have permission.

The most basic invocation will simply trigger the job or Pipeline and exit, but
with the additional options a user may also pass parameters, poll SCM, or even
follow the console output of the triggered build or Pipeline run.

[source]
----
% ssh -l kohsuke -p 53801 localhost help build

java -jar jenkins-cli.jar build JOB [-c] [-f] [-p] [-r N] [-s] [-v] [-w]
Starts a build, and optionally waits for a completion.  Aside from general
scripting use, this command can be used to invoke another job from within a
build of one job.  With the -s option, this command changes the exit code based
on the outcome of the build (exit code 0 indicates a success) and interrupting
the command will interrupt the job.  With the -f option, this command changes
the exit code based on the outcome of the build (exit code 0 indicates a
success) however, unlike -s, interrupting the command will not interrupt the
job (exit code 125 indicates the command was interrupted).  With the -c option,
a build will only run if there has been an SCM change.
 JOB : Name of the job to build
 -c  : Check for SCM changes before starting the build, and if there's no
       change, exit without doing a build
 -f  : Follow the build progress. Like -s only interrupts are not passed
       through to the build.
 -p  : Specify the build parameters in the key=value format.
 -s  : Wait until the completion/abortion of the command. Interrupts are passed
       through to the build.
 -v  : Prints out the console output of the build. Use with -s
 -w  : Wait until the start of the command
% ssh -l kohsuke -p 53801 localhost build build-all-software -f -v
Started build-all-software #1
Started from command line by admin
Building in workspace /tmp/jenkins/workspace/build-all-software
[build-all-software] $ /bin/sh -xe /tmp/hudson1100603797526301795.sh
+ echo hello world
hello world
Finished: SUCCESS
Completed build-all-software #1 : SUCCESS
%
----

==== console

Similarly useful is the `console` command, which retrieves the console output
for the specified build or Pipeline run. When no build number is provided, the
`console` command will output the last completed build's console output.

[source]
----
% ssh -l kohsuke -p 53801 localhost help console

java -jar jenkins-cli.jar console JOB [BUILD] [-f] [-n N]
Produces the console output of a specific build to stdout, as if you are doing 'cat build.log'
 JOB   : Name of the job
 BUILD : Build number or permalink to point to the build. Defaults to the last
         build
 -f    : If the build is in progress, stay around and append console output as
         it comes, like 'tail -f'
 -n N  : Display the last N lines
% ssh -l kohsuke -p 53801 localhost console build-all-software
Started from command line by kohsuke
Building in workspace /tmp/jenkins/workspace/build-all-software
[build-all-software] $ /bin/sh -xe /tmp/hudson1100603797526301795.sh
+ echo hello world
yes
Finished: SUCCESS
%
----

==== who-am-i

The `who-am-i` command is helpful for listing the current user's credentials
and permissions available to the user. This can be useful when debugging the
absence of CLI commands due to the lack of certain permissions.

[source]
----

% ssh -l kohsuke -p 53801 localhost help who-am-i

java -jar jenkins-cli.jar who-am-i
Reports your credential and permissions.
% ssh -l kohsuke -p 53801 localhost who-am-i
Authenticated as: kohsuke
Authorities:
  authenticated
%

== Using the CLI client

While the SSH-based CLI is fast and covers most needs, there may be situations where the CLI
client distributed with Jenkins is a better fit. For example, the default transport for the CLI client
is HTTP which means no additional ports need to be opened in a firewall for its
use.

=== Downloading the client

The CLI client can be downloaded directly from a Jenkins master at the URL
`/jnlpJars/jenkins-cli.jar`, in effect  `https://JENKINS_URL/jnlpJars/jenkins-cli.jar`

While a CLI `.jar` can be used against different versions of Jenkins, should
any compatibility issues arise during use, please re-download the latest `.jar`
file from the Jenkins master.

=== Using the client

The general syntax for invoking the client is as follows:

[source]
----
java -jar jenkins-cli.jar [-s JENKINS_URL] [global options...] command [command options...] [arguments...]
----

The `JENKINS_URL` can be specified via the environment variable `$JENKINS_URL`.
Summaries of other general options can be displayed by running the client with no arguments at all.

=== Client connection modes

There are three basic modes in which the 2.54+ / 2.46.2+ client may be used, selectable by global option:
`-http`; `-ssh`; and `-remoting`.

==== HTTP connection mode

This is the default mode as of 2.54 and 2.46.2, though you may pass the `-http` option explicitly for clarity.

Authentication is preferably with an `-auth` option, which takes a `username:apitoken` argument.
Get your API token from `/me/configure`:

[source]
----
java -jar jenkins-cli.jar [-s JENKINS_URL] -auth kohsuke:abc1234ffe4a command ...
----

(Actual passwords are also accepted, but this is discouraged.)

You can also precede the argument with `@` to load the same content from a file:

[source]
----
java -jar jenkins-cli.jar [-s JENKINS_URL] -auth @/home/kohsuke/.jenkins-cli command ...
----

Generally no special system configuration need be done to enable HTTP-based CLI connections.
If you are running Jenkins behind an HTTP(S) reverse proxy,
ensure it does not buffer request or response bodies.

==== SSH connection mode

Authentication is via SSH keypair.
You must select the Jenkins user ID as well:

[source]
----
java -jar jenkins-cli.jar [-s JENKINS_URL] -ssh -user kohsuke command ...
----

In this mode, the client acts essentially like a native `ssh` command.

By default the client will try to connect to an SSH port on the same host as is used in the `JENKINS_URL`.
If Jenkins is behind an HTTP reverse proxy, this will not generally work,
so run Jenkins with the system property `-Dorg.jenkinsci.main.modules.sshd.SSHD.hostName=ACTUALHOST`
to define a hostname or IP address for the SSH endpoint.

==== Remoting connection mode

This was the only mode supported by clients downloaded from a pre-2.54 / pre-2.46.2 Jenkins server
(prior to the introduction of the `-remoting` option).
Its use is deprecated for security and performance reasons.
That said, certain commands or command modes can _only_ run in Remoting mode,
typically because the command functionality involves running server-supplied code on the client machine.

This mode is disabled on the server side for new installations of 2.54+ and 2.46.2.
If you must use it, and accept the risks, it may be enabled in <<security, Configure Global Security>>.

Authentication is preferably via SSH keypair.
A `login` command and `--username` / `--password` command (note: *not global*) options are also available;
these are discouraged since they cannot work with a non-password-based security realm,
certain command arguments will not be properly parsed if anonymous users lack overall or job read access,
and saving human-chosen passwords for use in scripts is considered insecure.

Note that there are two transports available for this mode: over HTTP, or over a dedicated TCP socket.
If the <<security#jnlp-tcp-port, TCP port is enabled>> and seems to work, the client will use this transport.
If the TCP port is disabled, or such a port is advertised but does not accept connections
(for example because you are using an HTTP reverse proxy with a firewall),
the client will automatically fall back to the less efficient HTTP transport.

===== Common Problems with the Remoting-based client

There are a number of common problems that may be experienced when running the
CLI client.

====== Operation timed out

Check that the HTTP or TCP port is opened if you are using a firewall on your
server.  You can configure its value in Jenkins configuration. By default it is
set to use a random port.
