Jenkins stores its global configuration in files on the Jenkins controller.
Administrators and privileged users modify the global configuration from the Jenkins configuration pages.

== Jenkins home directory

The `JENKINS_HOME` directory is the root of the disk directory structure that Jenkins uses to perform builds and store archives.
The Jenkins home directory is listed in *Manage Jenkins* > *System* under the *Home directory* heading.

* On Windows by default, this is set to `C:\ProgramData\Jenkins\.jenkins`.
* On Ubuntu by default, this is set to `/var/lib/jenkins`.

[NOTE]
====
Default `JENKINS_HOME` locations vary by installation method:

* *Windows installer*: C:\ProgramData\Jenkins\.jenkins
* *Running from the `.war` file*: ~/.jenkins
* *Debian/Ubuntu package (`apt install jenkins`)*: /var/lib/jenkins
* *Red Hat package (`yum install jenkins`)*: /var/lib/jenkins
* *Fedora package (`dnf install jenkins`)*: /var/lib/jenkins
* *openSUSE package (`zypper install jenkins`)*: /var/lib/jenkins
====

But you can change this in one of the following ways:

* Set the `JENKINS_HOME` environment variable.
* Set the `JENKINS_HOME` Java system property.

You can change this location after you've used Jenkins for a while, too.
To do this:

. Stop Jenkins completely.
. Move the contents from the old `JENKINS_HOME` to the new location.
. Set the `JENKINS_HOME` variable to the new location.
. Restart Jenkins.

The directory structure of the `JENKINS_HOME` tree is often structured as follows:
[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
....
JENKINS_HOME
 +- builds            (build records)
    +- [BUILD_ID]     (subdirectory for each build)
         +- build.xml      (build result summary)
         +- changelog.xml  (change log)
 +- config.xml         (Jenkins root configuration file)
 +- *.xml              (other site-wide configuration files)
 +- fingerprints       (stores fingerprint records, if any)
 +- identity.key.enc   (RSA key pair that identifies an instance)
 +- jobs               (root directory for all Jenkins jobs)
     +- [JOBNAME]      (sub directory for each job)
         +- config.xml (job configuration file)
     +- [FOLDERNAME]   (sub directory for each folder)

     +- [PLUGIN]       (sub directory for each plugin)
     +- [PLUGIN].jpi   (.jpi or .hpi file for the plugin)
 +- secret.key         (deprecated key used for some plugins' secure operations)
 +- secret.key.not-so-secret  (used for validating _$JENKINS_HOME_ creation date)
 +- secrets        (root directory for the secret+key for credential decryption)
     +- hudson.util.Secret   (used for encrypting some Jenkins data)
     +- master.key           (used for encrypting the hudson.util.Secret key)
     +- InstanceIdentity.KEY (used to identity this instance)
     +- jenkins.model.Jenkins.crumbSalt   (used for encrypting some Jenkins data)
     +- initialAdminPassword (used for initial login)
 +- userContent        (files served under your https://server/userContent/)
 +- workspace          (working directory for the version control system)

== Configuring the system page

The *Configure System* page (`/manage/configure`) allows administrators to configure global settings for the Jenkins controller.
Below are the key sections available on this page:

=== System message
The system message is displayed at the top of every page in Jenkins.
It can be used to communicate important information to all users, such as maintenance schedules or announcements.

Example:
----
The system is undergoing maintenance on YYYY-MM-DD.
Expect downtime.
----

=== Quiet period
The quiet period defines a delay before a build starts after a change is detected. This helps avoid triggering multiple builds for closely spaced changes.

Example:
----
Set a quiet period of 5 seconds to batch changes.
----

This is particularly useful for version control integrations, where commits may occur in quick succession.

=== Jenkins location
This section defines the URL of the Jenkins controller.
It is important for proper communication with agents and external tools.
If Jenkins is behind a reverse proxy, ensure the URL matches the proxy configuration.

[NOTE]
====
For detailed instructions on configuring a reverse proxy, refer to the link:/doc/book/system-administration/reverse-proxy-configuration-with-jenkins/[reverse proxy configuration] guide.
====

=== Usage statistics
Jenkins collects anonymous usage statistics to help improve the software. This section allows you to opt-in or opt-out of this feature.

=== Plugin-specific configuration
Many plugins add their own global configuration options to the *Configure System* page. Since plugins extend Jenkins functionality, their settings often appear in this section and provide options for customization and fine-tuning.
Refer to the online help for each plugin to understand these settings.

[NOTE]
====
*Tip:* Use the question mark (`?`) icon next to each setting to access detailed help for that specific configuration.
