== `JENKINS_HOME` directory
The `JENKINS_HOME` directory is the root of the directory structure on disk that Jenkins uses to perform builds and keep archives.
You can check the location of the JENKINS_HOME directory by following these steps:

* Click Manage Jenkins.

* Click System.

* Check Home directory.

* On Windows By default, this is set to `C:\ProgramData\Jenkins\.jenkins`.
* On Ubuntu By default, this is set to `~/.jenkins`.

But you can change this in one of the following ways:

* Set the `JENKINS_HOME` environment variable
to the location of the new home directory
before launching the servlet container.
* Set the `JENKINS_HOME` system property in the servlet container.
* Set the `JNDI` environment entry `JENKINS_HOME` to the new directory.
See the link:/doc/book/installing/index[Installing Jenkins] for details about how to do this for your container.

You can change this location after you've used Jenkins for a while, too.
To do this:

. stop Jenkins completely.
. Move the contents from the old `JENKINS_HOME` to the new location.
. Set the `JENKINS_HOME` variable to the new location.
. Restart Jenkins.

The directory structure of the `JENKINS_HOME` tree is structured as follows:
