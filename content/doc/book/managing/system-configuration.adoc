Jenkins stores its global configuration in files on the Jenkins controller.
Administrators and privileged users modify the global configuration from the Jenkins configuration pages.

== Jenkins home directory

The `JENKINS_HOME` directory is the root of the directory structure on disk that Jenkins uses to perform builds and keep archives.
The Jenkins home directory is listed in *Manage Jenkins* > *System* under the *Home directory* heading.

* On Windows by default, this is set to `C:\ProgramData\Jenkins\.jenkins`.
* On Ubuntu by default, this is set to `~/.jenkins`.

But you can change this in one of the following ways:

* Set the `JENKINS_HOME` environment variable.
* Set the `JENKINS_HOME` Java system property.

You can change this location after you've used Jenkins for a while, too.
To do this:

. Stop Jenkins completely.
. Move the contents from the old `JENKINS_HOME` to the new location.
. Set the `JENKINS_HOME` variable to the new location.
. Restart Jenkins.

The directory structure of the `JENKINS_HOME` tree is often structured as follows:
[width="100%",cols="100%",]
