= User Content

Jenkins has a mechanism known as "User Content", where administrators can place files inside  `$JENKINS_HOME/userContent`,
and these files are served from \http://yourhost/jenkins/userContent. This can be thought of as a mini HTTP server to serve
images, stylesheets, and other static resources that you can use from various description fields inside Jenkins.

* Note that these files are not subject to any access controls beyond requiring Overall/Read access.
* See link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/git-userContent/[Git userContent plugin] for how to manage these files through a
Git repository.
