= Viewing logs

== Logs on the system

When running `jenkins.war` manually with `java -jar jenkins.war`,
all logging information by default is output to standard out. Many
Jenkins native packages modify this behavior to ensure logging
information is output in a more conventional location for the platform.

=== Linux

By default logs should be made available in
`/var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log`, unless customized in
`/etc/default/jenkins` (for *.deb) or via `/etc/sysconfig/jenkins`
(for */rpm)

=== Windows

By default logs should be at `%JENKINS_HOME%/jenkins.out` and
`%JENKINS_HOME%/jenkins.err`, unless customized in
`%JENKINS_HOME%/jenkins.xml`

=== Mac OS X

Log files should be at `+/var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log+`, unless
customized in `org.jenkins-ci.plist`.

=== Docker

If you run Jenkins inside docker as a detached container, you can use
`docker logs containerId` to view the Jenkins logs.

== Logs in Jenkins

Jenkins uses `java.util.logging` for logging. The `java.util.logging` system by
default sends every log above `INFO` to stdout.

Jenkins is equipped with a GUI for configuring/collecting/reporting log records of your choosing. 
This page shows you how to do this.

First, select the "System Log" from the "Manage Jenkins" page:

image::logging-manage-screen.png["Manage Jenkins"]

From there, you can create a custom log recorder, which helps you group
relevant logs together while filtering out the noise.

Choose a name that makes sense to you.

You'll be then asked to configure loggers and their levels whose output
you'd like to collect. Depending on which part of Jenkins you monitor,
you'll need to specify different loggers. Tell us the symptom of your
problem in the users list and we should be able to tell you where you
need to look. Also, this is really just a wrapper around the
java.util.logging package, so if you program in Java, you might be able
to guess where to look.

Once the set up is complete, Jenkins will start collecting data. The
collected logs are available from the web UI.

== Making custom logs available outside of the web UI

The simplest solution is to install the link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/support-core[Support Core Plugin], 
which causes custom logs to be written to disk automatically.

== Debug logging in Jenkins

1. Create a file `logging.properties`
2. Define the logging levels and a `ConsoleHandler`
3. Pass this file to the JVM by adding the system property `-Djava.util.logging.config.file=<pathTo>/logging.properties`.

An example *logging.properties* is included below.
Note that for a normal production environment the default level is INFO, it is not advised to have debug log in production.

# Keep this level to ALL or FINEST or it will be filtered before applying other levels
