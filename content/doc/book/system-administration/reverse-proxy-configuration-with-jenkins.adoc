= Reverse Proxy Configuration

A 'link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy[reverse proxy]' allows an alternate HTTP or HTTPS provider to communicate with web browsers on behalf of Jenkins.
The alternate provider may offer additional capabilities, like SSL encryption.
The alternate provider may offload some work from Jenkins, like delivering static images.

== General Guidelines

Jenkins actively monitors reverse proxy configuration.
Jenkins reports <<Jenkins says my reverse proxy setup is broken,"Your reverse proxy setup is broken">> when it detects a reverse proxy configuration problem.
See the <<troubleshooting>> section if Jenkins is reporting that your reverse proxy setup is broken.

=== Background

Reverse proxies receive inbound HTTP requests and forward those requests to Jenkins.
It receives the outbound HTTP response from Jenkins and forwards those requests to the original requester.
A correctly configured reverse proxy rewrites *both* the HTTP request and the HTTP response.

When HTTP request rewriting is misconfigured, pages won't be displayed at all.
Refer to <<Configuration Examples,configuration examples>> if your reverse proxy is not displaying any Jenkins pages.

A reverse proxy must handle the HTTP response by either rewriting the response or setting HTTP headers on the forwarded request.
When HTTP response handling is misconfigured, Jenkins may fail to show updated information on a page or it may ignore changes submitted through web pages.
See the <<troubleshooting>> section if Jenkins is reporting that your reverse proxy setup is broken or pages are not behaving as expected.

== Configuration Examples

Jenkins works with many different reverse proxies.
This page provides examples for specific reverse proxies, though much of the information also applies to other reverse proxies.

* <<Running Jenkins behind Apache>>
* <<Running Jenkins behind Nginx>>
* <<Running Jenkins behind HAProxy>>
* <<Running Jenkins behind Squid>>
* <<Running Jenkins behind IIS>>

=== Running Jenkins behind Apache

In situations where you have existing web sites on your server,
you may find it useful to run Jenkins (or the servlet container
that Jenkins runs in) behind Apache, so that you can bind Jenkins
to the part of a bigger website that you may have.
This section discusses some of the approaches for doing this.

*Make sure that you change the Jenkins httpListenAddress from its
default of 0.0.0.0 to 127.0.0.1 or any Apache-level restrictions can be
easily bypassed by accessing the Jenkins port directly.*

There are several different alternatives to configure Jenkins with Apache.
Choose the technique that best meets your needs:

* <<mod_proxy>>
* <<mod_proxy with HTTPS>>
* <<mod_ajp or mod_proxy_ajp>>
* <<mod_proxy_ajp with SSL>>
* <<mod_rewrite>>

==== mod_proxy

http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_proxy.html[mod_proxy] works by
making Apache perform "reverse proxy" â€” when a request arrives for
certain URLs, Apache becomes a proxy and forwards that request to
Jenkins, then forwards the response from Jenkins back to the client.

The following Apache modules must be installed :

[source]
----
a2enmod proxy
a2enmod proxy_http
a2enmod headers
----

A typical set up for mod_proxy would look like this:

[source]
----
ProxyPass         /jenkins  http://localhost:8081/jenkins nocanon
ProxyPassReverse  /jenkins  http://localhost:8081/jenkins
ProxyRequests     Off
AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode

# Local reverse proxy authorization override
# Most unix distribution deny proxy by default
# See /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/proxy.conf in Ubuntu
<Proxy http://localhost:8081/jenkins*>
  Order deny,allow
  Allow from all
</Proxy>
----

This assumes that you run Jenkins on port 8081.

For this set up to work, the context path of Jenkins *must be the same*
between your Apache and Jenkins (that is, you can't run Jenkins on
http://localhost:8081/ci and have it exposed at
http://localhost:80/jenkins). +
Set the context path in Windows by modifying the `+jenkins.xml+`
configuration file and adding --prefix=/jenkins (or similar) to the
<arguments> entry. +
Set the context path  when using the Ubuntu package by adding
`+--prefix=/jenkins+` to `+JENKINS_ARGS+` in `+/etc/default/jenkins+` (
or in `+/etc/sysconfig/jenkins+` for RHEL/CentOS package)

When running on a dedicated server and you are using / as context, make
sure you add a slash at the end of all URLs in proxy params in apache.
Otherwise you might run into proxy errors. So

[source]
----
ProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/ nocanon
----

instead of

[source]
----
ProxyPass / http://localhost:8080 nocanon     # wont work
----

Note that this does *not* apply to the `+ProxyPassMatch+` directive,
which behaves differently than `+ProxyPass+`.
Below is an example of `+ProxyPassMatch+` to proxy all URLs other than
`+/.well-known+` (a URL required by letsencrypt):

[source]
----
ProxyPassMatch  ^/(?\!.well-known)  http://localhost:8080 nocanon
----

The _ProxyRequests Off_ prevents Apache from functioning as a forward
proxy server (except for _ProxyPass_), it is advised to include it
unless the server should function as a proxy.

Both the `+nocanon+` option to `+ProxyPass+`, _and_
`+AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode+`, are required for certain Jenkins
features to work.

If you are running Apache on a Security-Enhanced Linux (SE-Linux)
machine it is essential to make SE-Linux do the right thing by issuing
as root

[source]
----
setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect true
----

If this is not issued Apache will not be allowed to forward proxy
requests to Jenkins and only an error message will be displayed.

Because Jenkins already compress its output, you can not use the normal
proxy-html filter to modify urls:

[source]
----
SetOutputFilter proxy-html
----

Instead you can use the following:

[source]
----
SetOutputFilter INFLATE;proxy-html;DEFLATE
ProxyHTMLURLMap http://your_server:8080/jenkins /jenkins
----

But since Jenkins seems to be well behaved it's even better to just not
use SetOutputFilter and ProxyHTMLURLMap.

If there are problems with Jenkins sometimes servicing random garbage
pages, then the following may help:

[source]
----
SetEnv proxy-nokeepalive 1
----

Some plug-ins determine URLs from client requests from Host header, so
if you experience some problems with wrong URLs, you can try to switch
on `+ProxyPreserveHost+` directive, which is switched off by default:

[source]
----
ProxyPreserveHost On
----

===== mod_proxy with HTTPS


You can add an additional `+ProxyPassReverse+` directive
to redirect non-SSL URLs generated by Jenkins to the SSL side.
Assuming that your webserver is `+your.host.com+`, placing the following within
the SSL virtual host definition will do the trick:

[source]
----
ProxyRequests     Off
ProxyPreserveHost On
AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode

<Proxy http://localhost:8081/jenkins*>
  Order deny,allow
  Allow from all
</Proxy>

ProxyPass         /jenkins  http://localhost:8081/jenkins nocanon
ProxyPassReverse  /jenkins  http://localhost:8081/jenkins
ProxyPassReverse  /jenkins  http://your.host.com/jenkins
----

Yet another option is to rewrite the Location headers that contain
non-ssl URL's generated by Jenkins.
If you want to access Jenkins from \https://www.example.com/jenkins,
placing the following within the SSL virtual host definition also works:

[source]
----
ProxyRequests     Off
ProxyPreserveHost On
ProxyPass /jenkins/ http://localhost:8081/jenkins/ nocanon
AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode

<Location /jenkins/>
  ProxyPassReverse /
  Order deny,allow
  Allow from all
</Location>

Header edit Location ^http://www.example.com/jenkins/ https://www.example.com/jenkins/
----

But it may also work fine to just use simple forwarding as above (the
first HTTPS snippet), and add

[source]
----
RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto "https"
RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Port "443"
----

in the HTTPS site configuration, as the Docker demo (below) does.
(`+X-Forwarded-Port+` is not interpreted by Jenkins prior to
https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-23294[JENKINS-23294] so it
may also be desirable to configure the servlet container to specify the
originating port.)


[source]
----
NameVirtualHost *:80
NameVirtualHost *:443

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin  webmaster@localhost
    Redirect permanent / https://www.example.com/
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:443>
    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/cert.pem
    ServerAdmin  webmaster@localhost
    ProxyRequests     Off
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode
    <Proxy *>
        Order deny,allow
        Allow from all
    </Proxy>
    ProxyPass         /  http://localhost:8080/ nocanon
    ProxyPassReverse  /  http://localhost:8080/
    ProxyPassReverse  /  http://www.example.com/
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto "https"
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Port "443"
</VirtualHost>
----

==== mod_ajp or mod_proxy_ajp

Jenkins can be configured to use mod_ajp or mod_proxy_ajp so that Jenkins runs in a different workspace than the typical Tomcat server, but both are available via the Apache web server.

Configure Jenkins to use a different web and ajp port than Tomcat:

[source]
----
HTTP_PORT=9080
AJP_PORT=9009
...
nohup java -jar "$WAR" \
           --httpPort=$HTTP_PORT \
           --ajp13Port=$AJP_PORT \
           --prefix=/jenkins >> "$LOG" 2>&1 &
----

Then setup Apache so that it knows that the prefix `+/jenkins+` is being
served by AJP in the httpd.conf file:

[source]
----
LoadModule jk_module          libexec/httpd/mod_jk.so

AddModule     mod_jk.c

#== AJP hooks ==
JkWorkersFile /etc/httpd/workers.properties
JkLogFile     /private/var/log/httpd/mod_jk.log
JkLogLevel    info
JkLogStampFormat "[%a %b %d %H:%M:%S %Y] "
JkOptions     +ForwardKeySize +ForwardURICompat -ForwardDirectories
JkRequestLogFormat     "%w %V %T"
# Here are 3 sample applications - 2 that are being served by Tomcat, and Jenkins
JkMount  /friki/* worker1
JkMount  /pebble/* worker1
JkMount  /jenkins/* worker2
----

Then finally the workers.conf file specified above, that just tells AJP
which port to use for which web application:

[source]
----
# Define 2 real workers using ajp13
worker.list=worker1,worker2
# Set properties for worker1 (ajp13)
worker.worker1.type=ajp13
worker.worker1.host=localhost
worker.worker1.port=8009
worker.worker1.lbfactor=50
worker.worker1.cachesize=10
worker.worker1.cache_timeout=600
worker.worker1.socket_keepalive=1
# Set properties for worker2 (ajp13)
worker.worker2.type=ajp13
worker.worker2.host=localhost
worker.worker2.port=9009
worker.worker2.lbfactor=50
worker.worker2.cachesize=10
worker.worker2.cache_timeout=600
worker.worker2.socket_keepalive=1
worker.worker2.recycle_timeout=300
----

==== mod_proxy_ajp with SSL

AJP is an arguably cleaner alternative for an SSL-enabled reverse proxy,
since Jenkins will get all pertinent HTTP headers untouched.
Configuration is a snap too, in three simple steps:

{empty}1. Configure an AJP port for Jenkins (as mentioned above)

[source]
----
HTTP_PORT=-1
AJP_PORT=9009
...
nohup java -jar "$WAR" \
           --httpPort=$HTTP_PORT \
           --ajp13Port=$AJP_PORT \
           --prefix=/jenkins >> "$LOG" 2>&1 &
----

{empty}2. Enable mod_proxy_ajp in Apache:

[source]
----
# a2enmod proxy_ajp
----

{empty}3. Include the following snippet in your SSL-enabled VirtualHost:

[source]
----
<VirtualHost *:443>
...
    SSLEngine on
...
    AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode
    ProxyRequests Off
    ProxyPass /jenkins ajp://localhost:9009/jenkins nocanon
</VirtualHost>
----

Note the use of `+AllowEncodedSlashes+` and `+ProxyPass...nocanon+` to
persuade Apache to leave PATH_INFO alone.

==== mod_rewrite

The Apache mod_rewrite module can be used to configure an Apache reverse proxy for Jenkins.

The following Apache modules must be installed :

[source]
----
a2enmod rewrite
a2enmod proxy
a2enmod proxy_http
----

A typical mod_rewrite configuration would look like this:

[source]
----
# Use last flag because no more rewrite can be applied after proxy pass
RewriteRule       ^/jenkins(.*)$  http://localhost:8081/jenkins$1 [P,L]
ProxyPassReverse  /jenkins        http://localhost:8081/jenkins
ProxyRequests     Off

# Local reverse proxy authorization override
# Most unix distribution deny proxy by default
# See /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/proxy.conf in Ubuntu
<Proxy http://localhost:8081/jenkins*>
  Order deny,allow
  Allow from all
</Proxy>
----

This assumes that you run Jenkins on port 8081.
For this set up to work, the context path of Jenkins must be the same
between your Apache and Jenkins (that is, you can't run Jenkins on
http://localhost:8081/ci and have it exposed at http://localhost:80/jenkins)

The _ProxyRequests Off_ prevents Apache from functioning as a forward
proxy server (except for _ProxyPass_), it is advised to include it
unless the server should function as a proxy.

==== Proxying CLI commands with the HTTP(S) transport

Using the plain CLI protocol with the HTTP(S) transport to access
Jenkins through an Apache reverse proxy does not work.
See https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-47279[JENKINS-47279 - Full-duplex HTTP(S) transport with plain CLI protocol does not work with Apache reverse proxy]
for more details.
As a workaround, you can use the link:/doc/book/managing/cli/#ssh[CLI over SSH].

If using Apache check that _nocanon_ is set on _ProxyPass_ and
that _AllowEncodedSlashes_ is set.

_AllowEncodedSlashes_ is not inherited in Apache configs, so this
directive must be placed inside the _VirtualHost_ definition.

=== Running Jenkins behind Nginx

In situations where you have existing web sites on your server, you may
find it useful to run Jenkins (or the servlet container that Jenkins
runs in) behind https://nginx.org/[Nginx], so that you can bind Jenkins
to the part of a bigger website that you may have.
This section discusses some of the approaches for doing this.

When a request arrives for certain URLs, Nginx becomes a proxy and
further forward that request to Jenkins, then it forwards the response
back to the client. A typical set up for mod_proxy would look like this:

[source]
----
upstream jenkins {
  keepalive 32; # keepalive connections
  server 127.0.0.1:8080; # jenkins ip and port
}

# Required for Jenkins websocket agents
map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
        default upgrade;
        '' close;
}

server {
  listen          80;       # Listen on port 80 for IPv4 requests

  server_name     jenkins.example.com;

  # this is the jenkins web root directory
  # (mentioned in the /etc/default/jenkins file)
  root            /var/run/jenkins/war/;

  access_log      /var/log/nginx/jenkins/access.log;
  error_log       /var/log/nginx/jenkins/error.log;
  # pass through headers from Jenkins that Nginx considers invalid
  ignore_invalid_headers off;

  location ~ "^/static/[0-9a-fA-F]{8}\/(.*)$" {
    #rewrite all static files into requests to the root
    #E.g /static/12345678/css/something.css will become /css/something.css
    rewrite "^/static/[0-9a-fA-F]{8}\/(.*)" /$1 last;
  }

  location /userContent {
    # have nginx handle all the static requests to userContent folder
    #note : This is the $JENKINS_HOME dir
    root /var/lib/jenkins/;
    if (!-f $request_filename){
      #this file does not exist, might be a directory or a /**view** url
      rewrite (.*) /$1 last;
      break;
    }
    sendfile on;
  }

  location / {
      sendfile off;
      proxy_pass         http://jenkins;
      proxy_redirect     default;
      proxy_http_version 1.1;

      # Required for Jenkins websocket agents
      proxy_set_header   Connection        $connection_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header   Upgrade           $http_upgrade;

      proxy_set_header   Host              $host;
      proxy_set_header   X-Real-IP         $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-For   $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      proxy_set_header   X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
      proxy_max_temp_file_size 0;

      #this is the maximum upload size
      client_max_body_size       10m;
      client_body_buffer_size    128k;

      proxy_connect_timeout      90;
      proxy_send_timeout         90;
      proxy_read_timeout         90;
      proxy_buffering            off;
      proxy_request_buffering    off; # Required for HTTP CLI commands
      proxy_set_header Connection ""; # Clear for keepalive
  }

}
----

This assumes that you run Jenkins on port 8080.
Remember to create the folder /var/log/nginx/jenkins.

For this set up to work, the context path of Jenkins must be the same
between your Nginx and Jenkins (that is, you can't run Jenkins on
http://localhost:8081/ci and have it exposed at
http://localhost:80/jenkins).

Set the context path by modifying the jenkins.xml configuration file and
adding --prefix=/jenkins to the <arguments> entry.

If you are having problems with some paths (eg folders) with *Blue
Ocean*, you may need to add the following snippet to your proxy
configuration:

[source]
----
if ($request_uri ~* "/blue(/.*)") {
    proxy_pass http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:YOUR_JENKINS_PORT/blue$1;
    break;
}
----

To give Nginx permission to read Jenkins web root folder, add the `nginx` user to
the Jenkins group:

[source,sh]
----
useradd -aG jenkins nginx
----

If you are experiencing timeouts when attempting to run long CLI
commands through a proxy in Jenkins, you can increase the
`+proxy_read_timeout+` setting as necessary.
Older versions of Jenkins may not respect the `+proxy_read_timeout+` setting.

If you are experiencing the following error when attempting to run long
CLI commands in Jenkins and Jenkins is running behind Nginx, it
is probably due to Nginx timing out the CLI connection.
You can increase the `+proxy_read_timeout+` setting as necessary so the command will
complete successfully.

=== Running Jenkins behind iptables

The default Jenkins installation runs on ports 8080 and 8443.
Typically, HTTP/HTTPS servers run on ports 80 and 443, respectively.
But these ports are considered privileged on Unix/Linux systems,
and the process using them must be owned by root.
Running Jenkins as root is not recommended - it should be run as its own user.
One solution is to front Jenkins with a web server such as Apache, and let
it proxy requests to Jenkins, but this requires maintaining the Apache installation as well.
In situations where you are wanting to run Jenkins on port 80 or 443
(i.e. HTTP/HTTPS), but you do not want to setup a proxy server you can
use _iptables_ on Linux to forward traffic.

==== Ubuntu Installations

Follow the link:/doc/book/installing/#debianubuntu[Ubuntu installation instructions] to install and configure the initial Jenkins installation on Ubuntu 18.04 or later.
These instructions are known to not work on Ubuntu versions prior to 18.04.

==== Prerequisites

In order to forward traffic from 80/443 to 8080/8443, first you must
ensure that iptables has allowed traffic on all 4 of these ports.
Use the following command to list the current iptables configuration:

[source]
----
 iptables -L -n
----

You should should see in the output entries for 80, 443, 8080,and 8443.
Here is an example output for comparison.

[source]
----
ain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)target     prot opt source               destination
target     prot opt source               destination
ACCEPT     tcp  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0           tcp dpt:443
ACCEPT     tcp  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0           tcp dpt:80
ACCEPT     tcp  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0           tcp dpt:8080
ACCEPT     tcp  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0           tcp dpt:8443
ACCEPT     all  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0           state RELATED,ESTABLISHED
ACCEPT     icmp --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0
ACCEPT     all  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0
ACCEPT     tcp  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0           state NEW tcp dpt:22
REJECT     all  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0           reject-with icmp-host-prohibited

Chain FORWARD (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination
REJECT     all  --  0.0.0.0/0            0.0.0.0/0           reject-with icmp-host-prohibited

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination
target     prot opt source
----

If you dont see entries for these ports, then you need to run commands
(as root or with sudo) to add those ports.
For example, if you see none of these and need to add them all,
you would need to issue the following commands:

[source]
----
sudo iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 8443 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
----

NOTE:: I used -I INPUT 1. In a lot of iptables
documentation/examples, you will see -A INPUT.
The difference is that -A appends to the list of rules,
while -I INPUT 1 inserts before the first entry.
Usually when adding new accept ports to iptables configuration,
you want to put them at the beginning of the ruleset, not the end.
Run iptables -L -n again and you should now see entries for these 4 ports.

==== Forwarding

Once traffic on the required ports are allowed, you can run the command
to forward port 80 traffic to 8080, and port 443 traffic to 8443.
The commands look like this:

[source]
----
sudo iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
sudo iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8443
----

You can verify the forwarding rules using below command.

[source]
----
[root@xyz~]# iptables -L -t nat
Chain PREROUTING (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination
REDIRECT   tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:http redir ports 8080
REDIRECT   tcp  --  anywhere             anywhere             tcp dpt:https redir ports 8443

Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination

Chain POSTROUTING (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination
----

 +

Once these rules are set and confirmed with iptables -L -n, and once
your Jenkins instance is up and running on port 8080, attempt to access
your Jenkins instance on port 80 instead of 8080.
It should work and your URL should stay on port 80 - in other words,
it should not get redirected to 8080.
The fact that forwarding from 80 to 8080 (or 443 to 8443) should remain
hidden from the client.

===== Saving iptables Configuration

Using the iptables command to change port configuration and routing
rules only changes the current, in-memory configuration.
It does not persist between restarts of the iptables service.
So, you need to make sure you save the configuration to make the changes permanent.

Saving the configuration is slightly different between Red Hat rpm based and
Debian-based systems.
On a Red Hat-based system (Fedora, CentOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Oracle Linux, etc), issue the following command:

[source]
----
sudo iptables-save > /etc/sysconfig/iptables
----

On a Debian-based system (Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, etc), issue the
following command:

[source]
----
sudo sh -c "iptables-save > /etc/iptables.rules"
----

The iptables-restore command will need to be executed manually, or your
system configured to automatically run it on boot, against the
/etc/iptables.rules file you have created, in order for your iptables
configuration to be retained across reboots.
On Ubuntu, the fastest way is to install `iptables-persistent` after configuring iptables.
It will automatically create the required files from the current configuration and load them on boot.

[source]
----
sudo apt-get install iptables-persistent
----

See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo for other Ubuntu
options.
There are many other resources describing this; please consult
your system's documentation or search on the internet for information
specific to your flavor of Linux.

If you are unsure at all about what kind of system you have, consult
that system's documentation on how to update iptables configuration.

==== Using firewalld

Some Linux distributions (CentOS 8, Red hat Enterprise Linux 8, CentOS 7, etc.)
ship with firewalld which serves as a front-end for iptables.
Configuration thru firewalld is done via the *firewall-cmd* command.
Instead of using any of the iptables commands mentioned above,
all you should need to do is something like:

[source]
----
# allow incoming connections on port 80.
# You can also use --add-service=http instead of adding a port number
sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=80/tcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent \
                  --add-forward-port=port=80:proto=tcp:toaddr=127.0.0.1:toport=8080

# allow incoming connections on port 443.
# You can also use --add-service=https instead of adding a port number
sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=443/tcp --permanen
t
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent \
                  --add-forward-port=port=443:proto=tcp:toaddr=127.0.0.1:toport=8443
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
----

With the above commands, jenkins can be configured to run on
localhost:8080 and/or localhost:8443 (depending if you need or want to
do SSL or not)

firewalld will then create the required iptables rules so that incoming
connections on port 80 are forwarded to jenkins on 8080 (and 443 is
forwarded to 8443).

=== Running Jenkins behind HAProxy

In situations where you want a user friendly URL, different public
ports, or to terminate SSL connections before they reach Jenkins, you
may find it useful to run Jenkins (or the servlet container that Jenkins
runs in) behind HAProxy.
This section discusses some of the approaches for doing this.

==== Plain HTTP

Using HAProxy 1.7.9, here is an example HAProxy.cfg to proxy over plain
HTTP:

[source]
----
# If you already have an haproxy.cfg file, you can probably leave the
# global and defaults section as-is, but you might need to increase the
# timeouts so that long-running CLI commands will work.
global
    maxconn 4096
    log 127.0.0.1 local0 debug

defaults
   log global
   option httplog
   option dontlognull
   option forwardfor
   maxconn 20
   timeout connect 5s
   timeout client 60s
   timeout server 60s

frontend http-in
   bind *:80
   mode http
   acl prefixed-with-jenkins  path_beg /jenkins/
   acl host-is-jenkins-example   hdr(host) eq jenkins.example.com
   use_backend jenkins if host-is-jenkins-example prefixed-with-jenkins

backend jenkins
   server jenkins1 127.0.0.1:8080
   mode http
   reqrep ^([^\ :]*)\ /(.*) \1\ /\2
   acl response-is-redirect res.hdr(Location) -m found
   # Must combine following two lines into a SINGLE LINE for HAProxy
   rspirep ^Location:\ (http|https)://127.0.0.1:8080/jenkins/(.*)
           Location:\ \1://jenkins.example.com/jenkins/\2 if response-is-redirect
----

This assumes Jenkins is running locally on port 8080.

This assumes that you are using the /jenkins/ context path for both the
site exposed from HAProxy, and Jenkins itself.
If this is not the case, you will need to adjust the configuration.

If you are experiencing the following error when attempting to run long
CLI commands in Jenkins, and Jenkins is running behind HAProxy,
it is probably due to HAProxy timing out the CLI connection.
You can increase the `+timeout client+` and `+timeout server+` settings as
necessary so the command will complete successfully.

==== With SSL

Using HAProxy 1.7.9, here is an example HAProxy.cfg to connect to the
proxy using SSL, terminate the SSL connection, and then talk to Jenkins
using plain HTTP:

[source]
----

=== Running Jenkins behind IIS

In situations where you have existing web sites on your server, you may
find it useful to run Jenkins (or the servlet container that Jenkins
runs in) behind http://nginx.org/[Nginx], so that you can bind Jenkins
to the part of a bigger website that you may have.
This section discusses some of the approaches for doing this.

*Make sure that you change the Jenkins httpListenAddress from its
default of 0.0.0.0 to 127.0.0.1 or configure the firewall to block
request on the port Jenkins is bound to, otherwise any IIS-level
restrictions can be easily bypassed by accessing the Jenkins port
directly.*

==== Requirements

* IIS 7.0 or greater.
** IIS 8.5 or greater if you want
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/get-started/whats-new-in-iis-85/certificate-rebind-in-iis85[Certificate
Rebind].
* https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite[URL Rewrite 2.1]
or greater.
** As the https://blogs.iis.net/iisteam/url-rewrite-v2-1[announcement]
explains, it introduces a feature flag to turn off the default
non-compliant-RFC3986 behavior. Which is what we want.
* https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/application-request-routing[Application
Request Routing]  3.0 or greater.
* Server access

==== Example use case

I have a dedicated Jenkins installation on a Windows Server 2012 R2
server with a Common Name of *VRTJENKINS01* in the Active Directory
domain *acme.example* and is reachable by the Fully Qualified Domain
Name *vrtjenkins01.acme.example*.
Additionally Jenkins runs on port *8080* and already listens to *127.0.0.1*
instead of 0.0.0.0 and the server has additional DNS names: *jenkins* and
*jenkins.acme.example*.

I want to have an IIS installation which acts as a TLS/SSL terminating
reverse proxy.
In combination with our in-house Active Directory Certificate Services
(ADCS, Microsoft's Certificate Authority software) this should make
certificate management a lot easier since Windows can be configured to
automatically renew certificates, and the IIS 8.5+ Certificate Rebind
feature can listen to renewal events (which contain the fingerprints of
both the old and new certificate) and update the relevant bind(s) to use
the fresh certificate.
This would ensure that after the initial manual request it would only be
necessary to manually change TLS/SSL related settings when the set of
Alternate Subject Names on the certificate IIS presents should change.

IIS will only have to act as 1) a reverse proxy for Jenkins 2) redirect
non-canonical URLs to the canonical URL: _\https://jenkins.acme.example/_

I have installed the IIS (8.5) role using the _Add Roles and Features
Wizard_ with the all the default and also the following non-default
features:

* HTTP Redirection (Under _Common HTTP Features_, to
redirect \http(s)://jenkins/, etc. to
https://jenkins.acme.example/)
* WebSocket Protocol (Under _Application Development_, because I felt
like it)

Then I installed URL Rewrite and Application Request Routing.

==== Configuration Time

===== Enabling Reverse Proxy functionality

. In the _Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager_ click on the
VRTJENKINS01 server.
. Go to _Application Request Routing Cache_.
. In the _Actions_ panel click on _Server Proxy Settings..._
. Enable the proxy
. Disable the _Reverse rewrite host in response header_
.. Don't worry, it will work, just follow the rest of the instructions
. Set the _Response buffer threshold (KB)_ to 0.
.. This helps to prevent HTTP 502 errors on Jenkin's Replay pages.
. Apply (the _Actions_ panel again)

===== Configuring TLS/SSL

Out of scope, there are enough tutorials on the rest of the interwebs
for this part.
The rest of this tutorial will assume it has been configured with a
certificate trusted by your browser of choice.

===== Configuring rules for response rewriting

. Go to the _Default Web Site_
. Go to __URL Rewrite__
. In the _Actions_ panel click _View Server Variables..._
. Add the following is not already define on the server level:
.. Name: *HTTP_FORWARDED*
. Click on _Back to Rules_
. _Click on Add Rule(s)..._
. Select _Reverse Proxy_ and click on OK
. Enter _jenkins.acme.example_ and click on OK
. Open the rule you just created
. Under _Conditions_ add:
.. Condition input: *\{CACHE_URL}*
.. Pattern: *^(http|ws)s://*
. Under _Server Variables_ add:
.. Name: *HTTP_FORWARDED*, Value:
*for=\{REMOTE_ADDR};by=\{LOCAL_ADDR};host="\{HTTP_HOST}";proto="https"*,
Replace: yes
... Jenkins runs under Jetty, Jetty supports
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7239[RFC7239], so all should be well.
. Under Action change:
..  Rewrite URL to
*\{C:1}\://jenkins.acme.example:8080\{UNENCODED_URL}*
... Note that there is no slash between the port number and the opening
curly bracket
.. *Remove* the check from the *Append query string* checkbox
. Apply the changes.
. Edit _C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts_ so that
*jenkins.acme.example* points to 127.0.0.1
.. When resolving names Windows will check if the name is its own name
before consulting the hosts file. Meaning that adding _vrtjenkins01_ or
_vrtjenkins01.acme.example_ to the hosts file won't have any effect.
... The hosts file will however be consulted before consulting the DNS
infrastructure

===== Experiencing the dreaded "It appears that your reverse proxy set up is broken." error for yourself

. \https://jenkins.acme.example/configure
. Configure the _Jenkins URL_ to
be **\https://jenkins.acme.example/**
and save the change
. Go to _Configure Global Security_ and enable
_Enable proxy compatibility_ if you have already enabled _Prevent Cross
Site Request Forgery exploits_
. Go to \https://jenkins.acme.example/manage
. You will still experience the "It appears that your reverse
proxy set up is broken." as expected
.. If you do not get that at this point, then that is very weird...
Continue anyway.
. Right click the _Configure System_ link and choose to
inspect the element.
.. Make sure you are still on the Manage page as you will want
it as your referrer
. Change the value of the _href_ attribute to be
_administrativeMonitor/hudson.diagnosis.ReverseProxySetupMonitor/test_
. Open the link you just changed in a new tab.
.. Keep this tab open
. Observe the "\https://jenkins.acme.example/manage
vs http:" error and bask in its glory
.. a white page served with HTTP status code is 200 indicates
all is well
... If you do get that at this point, then that is very
weird... Continue anyway.

===== Fixing the errors

. In IIS Manager got to _Application Pools_ then edit
_DefaultAppPool_ so that the _.NET CLR version_ is *No Managed Code*
.. You might find that this is not necessary (at far as you
can tell) for your setup, since IIS will only act as a TLS/SSL
offloading reverse proxy, we don't need it.
. Then go to _Sites_ â†’ _Default Web Site_ â†’ _Request
Filtering_ and in the _Actions_ panel choose _Edit Feature Settings..._
and turn on *Allow doube escaping*
.. This is so IIS forwards URLs like
\https://jenkins.acme.example/%2525 to Jenkins instead of
showing an IIS error page
. Last, but not least, go to _Sites_ â†’ _Default Web
Site_ â†’ __Configuration Editor__ and change the _Section_ to
_system.webServer/rewrite/rules_
. Now you should see the URL Rewrite 2.1 property
_useOriginalURLEncoding_ listed, if not install URL Rewrite 2.1 using
the x86 or x64 installer, not the WebPI one and resume from here after a
reboot.
. Change _useOriginalURLEncoding_ to *False*
.. As the URL Rewrite 2.1 announcement this will change the
value of \{UNENCODED_URL} to make it _RFC3986_ and usable for reverse
proxy forwarding purposes
.. original as in pre 2.1 behaviour.
. Refresh that tab you were supposed to keep open, or recreate
it.
.. Again, take some time to bask in its glory
. It should now be white, also the Manage page should no
longer complain!

===== Continue configuring IIS

Some of the things you might want but I won't cover:

* _Hypertext Strict Transport Security_ headers
* Redirecting from non canonical URLs to the canonical URL
(ok, sort of covered this in the web.config example)
* The X-UA-Compatibility header so that Internet Explorer 11
(or 9, or ...) won't claim to be IE 7 for intranet sites
* Use IIS Crypto to configure cipher suites
* ...

===== A working web.config

*web.config*

=== Running Jenkins behind Squid

In situations where you want a user friendly url to access Jenkins (Not
port 8080), it may make sense run Jenkins behind Squid, so that
you can access Jenkins on port 80 or 443.
This section discusses some of the approaches for doing this.

==== Squid 2.6

Using Squid 2.6:

You may be able to avoid that message with the `-noCertificateCheck` argument to `agent.jar`.
That will disable server certificate checking from the agent.

== Troubleshooting

=== Jenkins says my reverse proxy setup is broken

NOTE: This message can also appear if you don't access
Jenkins through a reverse proxy: Make sure the Jenkins URL configured in
the System Configuration matches the URL you're using to access Jenkins.

==== Symptoms

An error message is displayed in the "Manage Jenkins" page - "It appears
that your reverse proxy set up is broken"

==== Background

For a reverse proxy to work correctly, it needs to rewrite both the
request and the response.
Request rewriting involves receiving an inbound HTTP call and then making
a forwarding request to Jenkins (sometimes with some HTTP headers modified, sometimes not).
Failing to configure the request rewriting is easy to catch, because you
just won't see any pages at all.

But correct reverse proxying also involves *one of two options*, EITHER

* *rewrite the response* with a "Location" header in the response, which is used during redirects.
Jenkins sends `Location:{nbsp}\http://actual.server:8080/jenkins/foobar`
and the reverse proxy must to
rewrite it to `Location:{nbsp}\http://nice.name/jenkins/foobar`.
Unfortunately, failing to configure this correctly is harder to catch;
OR
* *set the headers* `+X-Forwarded-Host+` (and perhaps `+X-Forwarded-Port+`) on the forwarded request.
Jenkins will parse those headers and generate all the redirects and other
links on the basis of those headers.
Depending on your reverse proxy it may be easier to set `+X-Forwarded-Host+`
and `+X-Forwarded-Port+` to the hostname and port in the original `+Host+`
header respectively or it may be easier to just pass the original `+Host+`
header through as  `+X-Forwarded-Host+` and delete the `+X-Forwarded-Port+` #
header from the request.
You will also need to set the `+X-Forwarded-Proto+` header if your reverse
proxy is changing from `+https+` to `+http+` or vice-versa.

Jenkins has proactive monitoring to make sure this is configured correctly.
It uses XmlHttpRequest to request a specific URL in Jenkins (via relative path,
so this will always get through provided the request is properly rewritten),
which will then redirect the user to another page in Jenkins (this only works
correctly if you configured the response rewriting correctly), which then returns 200.

This error message indicates that this test is failing - and the most
likely cause is that the response rewriting is misconfigured.
See the  <<Configuration Examples,configuration examples>> for additional tips about
configuring a reverse proxy.

Be sure to set the `+X-Forwarded-Proto+` header if your reverse proxy is
accessed via HTTPS and then Jenkins itself is accessed via HTTP i.e.
proxying HTTPS to HTTP.

Changing the context path of Jenkins with a reverse proxy is fraught with danger.
There are lots of URLs that you need to rewrite correctly,
and even if you get the ones in HTML files you may miss some in
javascript, CSS or XML resources.

The recommendation is to ensure that Jenkins is running at the context
path that your reverse proxy is serving Jenkins at.
You will have the least pain if you keep to this principle.

While it is technically possible to use rewrite rules to change the context path,
you should be aware that it would be a lot of work to find and fix everything in
your rewrite rules and the reverse proxy will spend most of its time rewriting
responses from Jenkins.
Much easier to change Jenkins to run at the context path your reverse proxy is
expecting, e.g. if your reverse proxy is forwarding requests at
https://manchu.example.org/foobar/ to Jenkins then you could just use
`+java -jar jenkins.war --prefix /foobar+` to start jenkins using
`+/foobar+` as the context path

==== Further Diagnosis

For further diagnosis, try using cURL:

[source,sh]
----
BASE=administrativeMonitor/hudson.diagnosis.ReverseProxySetupMonitor
curl -iL -e http://your.reverse.proxy/jenkins/manage \
            http://your.reverse.proxy/jenkins/${BASE}/test
----

(assuming your Jenkins is located at
`http://your.reverse.proxy/jenkins/` - and is open to anonymous read
access)
