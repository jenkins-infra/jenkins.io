= Reverse proxy - HAProxy

In situations where you want a user friendly URL, different public
ports, or to terminate SSL connections before they reach Jenkins, you
may find it useful to run Jenkins (or the servlet container that Jenkins
runs in) behind HAProxy.
This section discusses some of the approaches for doing this.

== Plain HTTP

Using HAProxy 1.7.9, here is an example HAProxy.cfg to proxy over plain
HTTP:

[source]
----
# If you already have an haproxy.cfg file, you can probably leave the
# global and defaults section as-is, but you might need to increase the
# timeouts so that long-running CLI commands will work.
global
    maxconn 4096
    log 127.0.0.1 local0 debug

defaults
   log global
   option httplog
   option dontlognull
   option forwardfor
   maxconn 20
   timeout connect 5s
   timeout client 60s
   timeout server 60s

frontend http-in
   bind *:80
   mode http
   acl prefixed-with-jenkins  path_beg /jenkins/
   acl host-is-jenkins-example   hdr(host) eq jenkins.example.com
   use_backend jenkins if host-is-jenkins-example prefixed-with-jenkins

backend jenkins
   server jenkins1 127.0.0.1:8080
   mode http
   reqrep ^([^\ :]*)\ /(.*) \1\ /\2
   acl response-is-redirect res.hdr(Location) -m found
   # Must combine following two lines into a SINGLE LINE for HAProxy
   rspirep ^Location:\ (http|https)://127.0.0.1:8080/jenkins/(.*)
           Location:\ \1://jenkins.example.com/jenkins/\2 if response-is-redirect
----

This assumes Jenkins is running locally on port 8080.

This assumes that you are using the /jenkins/ context path for both the
site exposed from HAProxy, and Jenkins itself.
If this is not the case, you will need to adjust the configuration.

If you are experiencing the following error when attempting to run long
CLI commands in Jenkins, and Jenkins is running behind HAProxy,
it is probably due to HAProxy timing out the CLI connection.
You can increase the `+timeout client+` and `+timeout server+` settings as
necessary so the command will complete successfully.

== With SSL

Using HAProxy 1.7.9, here is an example HAProxy.cfg to connect to the
proxy using SSL, terminate the SSL connection, and then talk to Jenkins
using plain HTTP:

[source]
----
# If you already have an haproxy.cfg file, you can probably leave the
# global and defaults section as-is, but you might need to increase the
# timeouts so that long-running CLI commands will work.
global
    maxconn 4096
    log 127.0.0.1 local0 debug

defaults
   log global
   option httplog
   option dontlognull
   option forwardfor
   maxconn 20
   timeout connect 5s
   timeout client 5min
   timeout server 5min

frontend http-in
    bind *:80
    bind *:443 ssl crt /usr/local/etc/haproxy/ssl/server.pem
    mode http
    redirect scheme https if !{ ssl_fc } # Redirect http requests to https
    use_backend jenkins if { path_beg /jenkins/ }

backend jenkins
    server jenkins1 127.0.0.1:8080
    mode http
    http-request set-header X-Forwarded-Port %[dst_port]
    http-request add-header X-Forwarded-Proto https if { ssl_fc }
    reqrep ^([^\ :]*)\ /(.*)     \1\ /\2
    acl response-is-redirect res.hdr(Location) -m found
    # Must combine following two lines into a SINGLE LINE for HAProxy
    rspirep ^Location:\ (http)://127.0.0.1:8080/(.*)
            Location:\ https://jenkins.example.com:443/\2 if response-is-redirect
