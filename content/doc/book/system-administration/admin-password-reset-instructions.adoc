== Reset the administrator password

1. Log in to your Jenkins controller.
2. Stop the Jenkins process.
You may use this command: `systemctl stop jenkins`.
3. Edit the Jenkins configuration file (`config.xml`) inside your `jenkins/` or `$JENKINS_HOME` directory.
4. Look for **useSecurity** and change it from *true* to *false* manually.
5. Save your file and close it.
6. Restart the Jenkins service to apply your changes.
You may use this command: `systemctl start jenkins`.
After restarting Jenkins, navigate to your controller and sign in.
7. On the dashboard, select *Manage Jenkins* in the navigation pane on the left side of the page.
8. On the *Manage Jenkins* page, under the *Security* section, select *Configure Global Security*.
9. Under *Security Realm*, select *Jenkins' own user database* from the dropdown menu.
Ensure the option *Allow users to sign up* is unchecked and save your changes.
This redirects you to the Manage Jenkins page.
10. On the **Manage Jenkins** page, select **Users**.
11. You will see a list showing User IDs.
Select the User ID that you want to change the password for.
12. Select Configure using the gear icon or the dropdown menu from the User ID.
Locate the *Password* section to change your password.

After changing the password, you will be able to log into your Jenkins instance again using the same username and the new password that you have just set.

NOTE: Please ensure not to leave the Jenkins controller insecure.
So, please re-enable the security by following these steps.

== Enable security

1. Log in as your admin account.
2. On the dashboard, select *Manage Jenkins* in the navigation pane on the left side of the page.
3. On the *Manage Jenkins* page, under the *Security* section, select *Configure Global Security*.
4. Set the *Authorization* to *Logged-in users can do anything*.
Uncheck the option *Allow anonymous read access*.
Select *Save*.
