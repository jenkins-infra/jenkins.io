= Reverse proxy - Nginx

In situations where you have existing web sites on your server, you may
find it useful to run Jenkins (or the servlet container that Jenkins
runs in) behind https://nginx.org/[Nginx], so that you can bind Jenkins
to the part of a bigger website that you may have.
This section discusses some of the approaches for doing this.

When a request arrives for certain URLs, Nginx becomes a proxy and forwards that request to Jenkins, then it forwards the response back to the client.

This 9 minute video tutorial from Darin Pope configures Nginx as a reverse proxy.

The Nginx configuration fragment below provides an example Nginx reverse proxy configuration.
It assumes the Jenkins controller and the Nginx reverse proxy are running on the same computer.

This assumes that you run Jenkins on port 8080.
Remember to create the folder /var/log/nginx/jenkins.

include::doc/book/system-administration/reverse-proxy-configuration-with-jenkins/_context_path.adoc[]

If you are having problems with some paths (eg folders) with *Blue
Ocean*, you may need to add the following snippet to your proxy
configuration:

[source]
----
if ($request_uri ~* "/blue(/.*)") {
    proxy_pass http://YOUR_SERVER_IP:YOUR_JENKINS_PORT/blue$1;
    break;
}
----

== Permissions

To give Nginx permission to read Jenkins web root folder, add the `nginx` user to
the Jenkins group:

[source,sh]
----
usermod -aG jenkins nginx
----

If the last command failed because the `nginx` user is not defined in the system,
then you can try adding the `www-data` user to the Jenkins group:

[source,sh]
----
usermod -aG jenkins www-data
----

If you are experiencing timeouts when attempting to run long CLI
commands through a proxy in Jenkins, you can increase the
`+proxy_read_timeout+` setting as necessary.
Older versions of Jenkins may not respect the `+proxy_read_timeout+` setting.

If you are experiencing the following error when attempting to run long
CLI commands in Jenkins and Jenkins is running behind Nginx, it
is probably due to Nginx timing out the CLI connection.
You can increase the `+proxy_read_timeout+` setting as necessary so the command will
complete successfully.
