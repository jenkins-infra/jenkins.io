= Reverse proxy - Apache

In situations where you have existing web sites on your server,
you may find it useful to run Jenkins (or the servlet container
that Jenkins runs in) behind Apache, so that you can bind Jenkins
to the part of a bigger website that you may have.
This section discusses some of the approaches for doing this.

*Make sure that you change the Jenkins httpListenAddress from its
default of 0.0.0.0 to 127.0.0.1 or any Apache-level restrictions can be
easily bypassed by accessing the Jenkins port directly.*

There are several different alternatives to configure Jenkins with Apache.
Choose the technique that best meets your needs:

* <<mod_proxy>>
* <<mod_proxy with HTTPS>>
* <<mod_rewrite>>

This 6 minute tutorial from Darin Pope configures Apache httpd on Alma Linux as a reverse proxy with <<mod_proxy>>.

== mod_proxy

http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_proxy.html[mod_proxy] works by
making Apache perform "reverse proxy" â€” when a request arrives for
certain URLs, Apache becomes a proxy and forwards that request to
Jenkins, then forwards the response from Jenkins back to the client.

The following Apache modules must be installed :

[source]
----
a2enmod proxy
a2enmod proxy_http
a2enmod headers
----

A typical set up for mod_proxy would look like this:

[source]
----
ProxyPass         /jenkins  http://localhost:8081/jenkins nocanon
ProxyPassReverse  /jenkins  http://localhost:8081/jenkins
ProxyRequests     Off
AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode

# Local reverse proxy authorization override
# Most unix distribution deny proxy by default
# See /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/proxy.conf in Ubuntu
<Proxy http://localhost:8081/jenkins*>
  Order deny,allow
  Allow from all
</Proxy>
----

This assumes that you run Jenkins on port 8081.

<<context-path>> provides more details on reverse proxy requires for the Jenkins context path.

When running on a dedicated server and you are using / as context, make
sure you add a slash at the end of all URLs in proxy params in apache.
Otherwise you might run into proxy errors. So

[source]
----
ProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/ nocanon
----

instead of

[source]
----
ProxyPass / http://localhost:8080 nocanon     # wont work
----

Note that this does *not* apply to the `+ProxyPassMatch+` directive,
which behaves differently than `+ProxyPass+`.
Below is an example of `+ProxyPassMatch+` to proxy all URLs other than
`+/.well-known+` (a URL required by letsencrypt):

[source]
----
ProxyPassMatch  ^/(?\!.well-known)  http://localhost:8080 nocanon
----

The _ProxyRequests Off_ prevents Apache from functioning as a forward
proxy server (except for _ProxyPass_), it is advised to include it
unless the server should function as a proxy.

Both the `+nocanon+` option to `+ProxyPass+`, _and_
`+AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode+`, are required for certain Jenkins
features to work.

If you are running Apache on a Security-Enhanced Linux (SE-Linux)
machine it is essential to make SE-Linux do the right thing by issuing
as root

[source]
----
setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect true
----

If this is not issued Apache will not be allowed to forward proxy
requests to Jenkins and only an error message will be displayed.

Because Jenkins already compress its output, you can not use the normal
proxy-html filter to modify urls:

[source]
----
SetOutputFilter proxy-html
----

Instead you can use the following:

[source]
----
SetOutputFilter INFLATE;proxy-html;DEFLATE
ProxyHTMLURLMap http://your_server:8080/jenkins /jenkins
----

But since Jenkins seems to be well behaved it's even better to just not
use SetOutputFilter and ProxyHTMLURLMap.

If there are problems with Jenkins sometimes servicing random garbage
pages, then the following may help:

[source]
----
SetEnv proxy-nokeepalive 1
----

Some plug-ins determine URLs from client requests from Host header, so
if you experience some problems with wrong URLs, you can try to switch
on `+ProxyPreserveHost+` directive, which is switched off by default:

[source]
----
ProxyPreserveHost On
----

=== mod_proxy with HTTPS

You can add an additional `+ProxyPassReverse+` directive
to redirect non-SSL URLs generated by Jenkins to the SSL side.
Assuming that your webserver is `+your.host.com+`, placing the following within
the SSL virtual host definition will do the trick:

[source]
----
ProxyRequests     Off
ProxyPreserveHost On
AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode

<Proxy http://localhost:8081/jenkins*>
  Order deny,allow
  Allow from all
</Proxy>

ProxyPass         /jenkins  http://localhost:8081/jenkins nocanon
ProxyPassReverse  /jenkins  http://localhost:8081/jenkins
ProxyPassReverse  /jenkins  http://your.host.com/jenkins
----

Yet another option is to rewrite the Location headers that contain
non-ssl URL's generated by Jenkins.
If you want to access Jenkins from \https://www.example.com/jenkins,
placing the following within the SSL virtual host definition also works:

[source]
----
ProxyRequests     Off
ProxyPreserveHost On
ProxyPass /jenkins/ http://localhost:8081/jenkins/ nocanon
AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode

<Location /jenkins/>
  ProxyPassReverse /
  Order deny,allow
  Allow from all
</Location>

Header edit Location ^http://www.example.com/jenkins/ https://www.example.com/jenkins/
----

But it may also work fine to just use simple forwarding as above (the
first HTTPS snippet), and add

[source]
----
RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto "https"
RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Port "443"
----

in the HTTPS site configuration, as the Docker demo (below) does.
(`+X-Forwarded-Port+` is not interpreted by Jenkins prior to
https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-23294[JENKINS-23294] so it
may also be desirable to configure the servlet container to specify the
originating port.)

[source]
----
NameVirtualHost *:80
NameVirtualHost *:443

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin  webmaster@localhost
    Redirect permanent / https://www.example.com/
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:443>
    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/cert.pem
    ServerAdmin  webmaster@localhost
    ProxyRequests     Off
    ProxyPreserveHost On
    AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode
    <Proxy *>
        Order deny,allow
        Allow from all
    </Proxy>
    ProxyPass         /  http://localhost:8080/ nocanon
    ProxyPassReverse  /  http://localhost:8080/
    ProxyPassReverse  /  http://www.example.com/
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto "https"
    RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Port "443"
</VirtualHost>
----

== mod_rewrite

The Apache mod_rewrite module can be used to configure an Apache reverse proxy for Jenkins.

The following Apache modules must be installed :

[source]
----
a2enmod rewrite
a2enmod proxy
a2enmod proxy_http
----

A typical mod_rewrite configuration would look like this:

[source]
----
# Use last flag because no more rewrite can be applied after proxy pass
# NE makes sure slashes are not re-encoded.
# Apache does not re-encode spaces though, we ask Apache to encode it again with the B flag
# BNP tells apache to use %20 instead of + to re-encode the space
RewriteRule       ^/jenkins(.*)$  http://localhost:8081/jenkins$1 [P,L,NE,B=\,BNP]
ProxyPassReverse  /jenkins        http://localhost:8081/jenkins
ProxyRequests     Off

AllowEncodedSlashes NoDecode

# Local reverse proxy authorization override
# Most unix distribution deny proxy by default
# See /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/proxy.conf in Ubuntu
<Proxy http://localhost:8081/jenkins*>
  Order deny,allow
  Allow from all
</Proxy>

# If using HTTPS, add the following directives
# RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Proto "https"
# RequestHeader set X-Forwarded-Port "443"
----

This assumes that you run Jenkins on port 8081.
The context path of Jenkins must be the same between Apache and Jenkins.
Jenkins can't run on \http://example.com:8081/ci and be reverse proxied at \http://example.com/jenkins .
<<context-path>> provides more details on reverse proxy requires for the Jenkins context path.

The _ProxyRequests Off_ prevents Apache from functioning as a forward
proxy server (except for _ProxyPass_), it is advised to include it
unless the server should function as a proxy.

== Proxying CLI commands with the HTTP(S) transport

Using the plain CLI protocol with the HTTP(S) transport to access
Jenkins through an Apache reverse proxy does not work.
See https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-47279[JENKINS-47279 - Full-duplex HTTP(S) transport with plain CLI protocol does not work with Apache reverse proxy]
for more details.
As a workaround, you can use the link:/doc/book/managing/cli/#ssh[CLI over SSH].

If using Apache check that _nocanon_ is set on _ProxyPass_ and
that _AllowEncodedSlashes_ is set.

_AllowEncodedSlashes_ is not inherited in Apache configs, so this
directive must be placed inside the _VirtualHost_ definition.
