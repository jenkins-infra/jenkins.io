= Reverse proxy - Pomerium

You can secure your Jenkins application with JWT authentication and custom claims behind link:https://pomerium.com[Pomerium], an open source reverse proxy.

== Why use Pomerium with Jenkins?

You can set up role-based permissions in Jenkins to control a user’s privileges with Jenkins’ built-in authorization matrix.
However, this method requires a username and password to sign in and relies on Jenkins’ user database to store credentials.

JWT authentication is a more secure method of identity verification that authenticates and authorizes users against an identity provider, eliminating the need to store or share credentials to access your Jenkins application.

However, Jenkins doesn’t support JWT authentication out of the box.
With Pomerium, you can implement JWT authentication and apply claims to your route’s authorization policy to determine a user’s role and privileges before granting a user access to Jenkins.

Once you’ve configured JWT authentication, you can assign permissions within Jenkins for a specific user, any authenticated user, anonymous users, or a user group.

== Secure Jenkins with Pomerium proxy

Note: This guide assumes v0.21 of Pomerium! Please refer to Pomerium's link:https://www.pomerium.com/docs/guides/jenkins[guide on securing Jenkins] for the latest version of this guide.

=== Before you begin

To complete this guide, you need:

1. link:https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[Docker] and link:https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[Docker Compose]
2. An link:https://www.pomerium.com/docs/identity-providers[identity provider] (IdP)

If you haven’t, complete the link:https://www.pomerium.com/docs/quickstart[Pomerium Core quickstart] to familiarize yourself with running Pomerium in a container environment. It is free and should take no more than five minutes to get Pomerium open source proxy running.

== Run Jenkins with Docker Compose

Create a project and add a file called `docker-compose.yaml`.

In the `docker-compose.yaml` file, add the following code:

```yaml title=docker-compose.yaml
jenkins:
  networks:
    main: {}
  image: jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk11
  privileged: true
  user: root
  ports:
    - 8080:8080
    - 50000:50000

  volumes:
    # File path to Jenkins_home -- stores configs, build logs, and artifacts
    - ./home/jenkins_compose/jenkins_configuration:/var/jenkins_home
    # "sock" is the Unix socket the Docker daemon listens on by default
    - ./var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
```

Now, run `docker compose up`.

== Set up your Jenkins instance

If your Jenkins container is set up correctly, the Setup Wizard guides you through several prompts before you can access your dashboard.

To set up your Jenkins instance:

1. Go to `localhost:8080` and enter the admin user password to continue. You can find the admin user password in your Docker logs or in `/var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword`.

2. Install the suggested plugins

3. Create an admin user. You can create your first admin user or select **Skip and continue as admin**. If you skip and continue as admin, the default username is **admin** and the password is the admin user password.

4. In the **Instance Configuration** window, accept the default hostname

After completing the Setup Wizard prompts, you can access the Jenkins dashboard.

Now, run `docker compose stop` so you can configure Pomerium.

== Configure Pomerium

=== Create a Pomerium configuration file

In your project’s root folder, create a `config.yaml` file.

In your `config.yaml` file, add the following code:

```yaml title=config.yaml
authenticate_service_url: https://authenticate.localhost.pomerium.io

idp_provider: REPLACE_ME
idp_provider_url: REPLACE_ME
idp_client_id: REPLACE_ME
idp_client_secret: REPLACE_ME

signing_key: REPLACE_ME

routes:
 - from: https://verify.localhost.pomerium.io
   to: http://verify:8000
   pass_identity_headers: true
   policy:
     - allow:
         and:
	email:
	      is: user@example.com
 - from: https://jenkins.localhost.pomerium.io
   to: http://jenkins:8080/
   host_rewrite_header: true
   pass_identity_headers: true
   policy:
     - allow:
         and:
           - domain:
               is: example.com
           - user:
               is: username
```

Next, you need to:

- Update the link:https://www.pomerium.com/docs/identity-providers[identity provider] configuration variables with your own
- Replace `user@example.com` with the email associated with your IdP
- Replace `example.com` with your organization’s domain name
- Replace `username` with the username associated with your IdP
- Generate a signing key

To generate a link:https://www.pomerium.com/docs/reference/signing-key[signing key], use the commands below:

```bash
# Generates a P-256 (ES256) signing key
openssl ecparam  -genkey  -name prime256v1  -noout  -out ec_private.pem
# Prints the base64 encoded value of the signing key
cat ec_private.pem | base64
```

Add the base64-encoded signing key to the `signing_key` variable in your `config.yaml` file.

=== Run Pomerium services with Docker Compose

In your `docker-compose.yaml` file, replace the code in the file with the Pomerium and Jenkins services below:

```
version: '3'
networks:
 main: {}
services:
 pomerium:
   image: pomerium/pomerium:latest
   volumes:
     - ./config.yaml:/pomerium/config.yaml:ro
   ports:
     - 443:443
   networks:
     main:
       aliases:
       - authenticate.localhost.pomerium.io
 verify:
   networks:
     main: {}
   image: pomerium/verify:latest
   expose:
     - 8000
 jenkins:
   networks:
     main: {}
   image: jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk11
   privileged: true
   user: root
   ports:
     - 8080:8080
     - 50000:50000
   volumes:
     # File path to Jenkins_home -- stores configs, build logs, and artifacts
     - ./home/jenkins_compose/jenkins_configuration:/var/jenkins_home
     # "sock" is the Unix socket the Docker daemon listens on by default
     - ./var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
```

Run `docker compose up` and navigate to the external Jenkins route at `https://jenkins.localhost.pomerium.io`.

Jenkins will prompt you to sign in with your username and password. Sign in to continue to the Jenkins dashboard.

== Install Jenkins plugins

Next, you need to add plugins to enable JWT authentication and bypass TLS validation.

Install the link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/jwt-auth/[**JWT Auth** plugin]:

1. Select **Manage Jenkins**
2. Under **System Configuration**, select **Manage Plugins**
3. Select **Available Plugins**
4. In the search bar, enter **JWT Auth**
5. Select the JWT Auth plugin and **Install without restart**

Install the link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/skip-certificate-check/[**skip-certificate-check** plugin]:

1. Select **Available Plugins**
2. In the search bar, enter **skip-certificate-check**
3. Select the skip-certificate-check plugin and **Install without restart**

Once you’ve installed both plugins, **stop your containers**.

== Configure JWT authentication

Go to your external Jenkins route.

To configure JWT authentication:

1. Go to **Manage Jenkins**
2. Under **Security**, select **Configure Global Security**
3. Under **Authentication** > **Security Realm**, select **JWT Header Authentication Plugin**

Under **Global JWT Auth Settings**, you’ll see form fields where you can enter JWT claims. Pomerium forwards a user’s associated link:https://www.pomerium.com/docs/capabilities/getting-users-identity#jwt-verification[identity information] in a signed attestation JWT that’s included in upstream requests in an `X-Pomerium-Jwt-Assertion` header.

With the plugin:jwt-auth[JWT Auth] plugin installed, Jenkins can receive and parse the assertion header to authenticate users – you just need to give it the right instructions to find the header and JWT claims.

Enter the following information in the **Global JWT Auth Settings** field:


.Global JWT Auth Settings
|===
|Field |Value

|**Header name**
|`x-pomerium-jwt-assertion`

|**Username claim name**
|`name` or `email`

|**Groups claim name**
|`groups`

|**Groups claim list separator**
|`,`

|**Email claim name** 
|`email`

|**Acceptable issuers**
|`authenticate.corp.example.com`

|**Acceptable audiences**
|`jenkins.corp.example.com`

|**JWKS JSON URL**
|`https://jenkins.corp.example.com/.well-known/pomerium/jwks.json`
|===

Note the following details about the fields above:

- **Username claim name** can be either your name or email
- **Acceptable issuers** must be the URL of the authentication domain that issued the JWT. The `iss` claim tells the target application who the issuing authority is and provides context about the subject.
- **Acceptable audiences** must be the URL of the target application. The `aud` claim defines what application the JWT is intended for.
- **JWKS JSON URL** appends `/.well-known/pomerium/jwks.json` to the external route URL. The JWKS endpoint provides Jenkins the user’s public key to verify their JWT signature.

You can go to the external `verify` route defined in your policy to view your JWT claims.

In the **Authorization** dropdown, configure Jenkins permissions so that **Anonymous** has **Administer** privileges.

1. Select **Matrix-based security**
2. Under **Overall**, assign **Administer** to **Anonymous** and **Authenticated Users**

If JWT authentication doesn't authenticate you successfully, Jenkins signs you in as an anonymous user. With administer privileges, you can troubleshoot JWT settings as an anonymous user and try again.

Select **save** to apply the security settings.

=== Test JWT authentication

Restart your container. If the JWT authentication worked, your name appears in the dashboard instead of **admin**. To see more details about the request, add `/whoAmI` to the URL. For example, `https://jenkins.localhost.pomerium.io/whoAmI`.

== Update your Jenkins authorization settings

Now, you can configure your Jenkins authorization settings:

1. Select **Matrix-based security**
2. Select **Add user…** and enter the name or email associated with your IdP (the value depends on what claim you entered for **Username claim name**)

Assign yourself **Administer** privileges and whatever privileges seem appropriate to **Authenticated Users** and **Anonymous** users.

Select **save** to apply the security changes.

== Next steps: Add more context to your policies

You can adjust the authorization policy within Jenkins to limit or broaden what privileges authenticated and anonymous users have, but you can also extend your authorization policies with Pomerium.

For example:

- You can build a policy that only allows users to access Jenkins at certain times of day or days of the week, or limit access to certain devices
- You can import custom groups claims from your IdP and only allow access to members of the group
