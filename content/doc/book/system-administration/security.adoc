= Securing Jenkins

In the default configuration of Jenkins 1.x, Jenkins does not perform any
security checks. This means the ability of Jenkins to launch processes and
access local files are available to anyone who can access Jenkins web UI and
some more.

Securing Jenkins has two aspects to it.

* Access control, which ensures users are authenticated when accessing Jenkins
  and their activities are authorized.
* Protecting Jenkins against external threats

== Access Control

You should lock down the access to Jenkins UI so that users are authenticated
and appropriate set of permissions are given to them. This setting is
controlled mainly by two axes:

* *Security Realm*, which determines users and their passwords, as well as what
  groups the users belong to.
* *Authorization Strategy*, which determines who has access to what.

These two axes are orthogonal, and need to be individually configured. For
example, you might choose to use external LDAP or Active Directory as the
security realm, and you might choose "everyone full access once logged in" mode
for authorization strategy. Or you might choose to let Jenkins run its own user
database, and perform access control based on the permission/user matrix.

In addition to access control of users, link:build-authorization[access control for builds] limits what builds can do, once started.

== Protect users of Jenkins from other threats

There are additional security subsystems in Jenkins that protect Jenkins and
users of Jenkins from indirect attacks.

The following topics discuss features that are *off by default*.
We recommend you read them first and act on them immediately.

* https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/CSRF+Protection[CSRF Protection] --- prevent a remote attack against Jenkins running inside your firewall. This feature is *off by default* in Jenkins 1.x and when upgrading to 2.x.
* https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Security+implication+of+building+on+master[Security implication of building on master] --- protect Jenkins master from malicious builds
* https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Slave+To+Master+Access+Control[Slave To Master Access Control] --- protect Jenkins master from malicious build agents
* https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Securing+JENKINS_HOME[Securing JENKINS_HOME] --- protect Jenkins from users with local access

The following topics discuss other security features that are on by default. You'll only need to look at them when they are causing problems.

* link:configuring-content-security-policy/[Configuring Content Security Policy] --- protect users of Jenkins from malicious builds
* https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Markup+formatting[Markup formatting] --- protect users of Jenkins from malicious users of Jenkins


== Disabling Security

One may accidentally set up a security realm / authorization in such a way that
you may no longer be able to reconfigure Jenkins.

When this happens, you can fix this by the following steps:

. Stop Jenkins (the easiest way to do this is to stop the servlet container.)
. Go to `$JENKINS_HOME` in the file system and find `config.xml` file.
. Open this file in the editor.
. Look for the `<useSecurity>true</useSecurity>` element in this file.
. Replace `true` with `false`
. Remove the elements `authorizationStrategy` and `securityRealm`
. Start Jenkins
. When Jenkins comes back, it will be in an unsecured mode where everyone gets full
  access to the system.

If this is still not working, trying renaming or deleting `config.xml`.
