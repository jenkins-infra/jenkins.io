= Reverse proxy - IIS

In situations where you have existing web sites on your server, you may
find it useful to run Jenkins (or the servlet container that Jenkins
runs in) behind http://nginx.org/[Nginx], so that you can bind Jenkins
to the part of a bigger website that you may have.
This section discusses some of the approaches for doing this.

*Make sure that you change the Jenkins httpListenAddress from its
default of 0.0.0.0 to 127.0.0.1 or configure the firewall to block
request on the port Jenkins is bound to, otherwise any IIS-level
restrictions can be easily bypassed by accessing the Jenkins port
directly.*

== Requirements

* IIS 7.0 or greater.
** IIS 8.5 or greater if you want
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/get-started/whats-new-in-iis-85/certificate-rebind-in-iis85[Certificate
Rebind].
* https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/url-rewrite[URL Rewrite 2.1]
or greater.
** As the https://blogs.iis.net/iisteam/url-rewrite-v2-1[announcement]
explains, it introduces a feature flag to turn off the default
non-compliant-RFC3986 behavior. Which is what we want.
* https://www.iis.net/downloads/microsoft/application-request-routing[Application
Request Routing]  3.0 or greater.
* Server access

== Example use case

I have a dedicated Jenkins installation on a Windows Server 2012 R2
server with a Common Name of *VRTJENKINS01* in the Active Directory
domain *acme.example* and is reachable by the Fully Qualified Domain
Name *vrtjenkins01.acme.example*.
Additionally Jenkins runs on port *8080* and already listens to *127.0.0.1*
instead of 0.0.0.0 and the server has additional DNS names: *jenkins* and
*jenkins.acme.example*.

I want to have an IIS installation which acts as a TLS/SSL terminating
reverse proxy.
In combination with our in-house Active Directory Certificate Services
(ADCS, Microsoft's Certificate Authority software) this should make
certificate management a lot easier since Windows can be configured to
automatically renew certificates, and the IIS 8.5+ Certificate Rebind
feature can listen to renewal events (which contain the fingerprints of
both the old and new certificate) and update the relevant bind(s) to use
the fresh certificate.
This would ensure that after the initial manual request it would only be
necessary to manually change TLS/SSL related settings when the set of
Alternate Subject Names on the certificate IIS presents should change.

IIS will only have to act as 1) a reverse proxy for Jenkins 2) redirect
non-canonical URLs to the canonical URL: _\https://jenkins.acme.example/_

I have installed the IIS (8.5) role using the _Add Roles and Features
Wizard_ with the all the default and also the following non-default
features:

* HTTP Redirection (Under _Common HTTP Features_, to
redirect \http(s)://jenkins/, etc. to
https://jenkins.acme.example/)
* WebSocket Protocol (Under _Application Development_, because I felt
like it)

Then I installed URL Rewrite and Application Request Routing.

== Configuration Time

=== Enabling Reverse Proxy functionality

. In the _Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager_ click on the
VRTJENKINS01 server.
. Go to _Application Request Routing Cache_.
. In the _Actions_ panel click on _Server Proxy Settings..._
. Enable the proxy
. Disable the _Reverse rewrite host in response header_
.. Don't worry, it will work, just follow the rest of the instructions
. Set the _Response buffer threshold (KB)_ to 0.
.. This helps to prevent HTTP 502 errors on Jenkin's Replay pages.
. Apply (the _Actions_ panel again)

=== Configuring TLS/SSL

Out of scope, there are enough tutorials on the rest of the interwebs
for this part.
The rest of this tutorial will assume it has been configured with a
certificate trusted by your browser of choice.

=== Configuring rules for response rewriting

. Go to the _Default Web Site_
. Go to __URL Rewrite__
. In the _Actions_ panel click _View Server Variables..._
. Add the following is not already define on the server level:
.. Name: *HTTP_FORWARDED*
. Click on _Back to Rules_
. _Click on Add Rule(s)..._
. Select _Reverse Proxy_ and click on OK
. Enter _jenkins.acme.example_ and click on OK
. Open the rule you just created
. Under _Conditions_ add:
.. Condition input: *\{CACHE_URL}*
.. Pattern: *^(http|ws)s://*
. Under _Server Variables_ add:
.. Name: *HTTP_FORWARDED*, Value:
*for=\{REMOTE_ADDR};by=\{LOCAL_ADDR};host="\{HTTP_HOST}";proto="https"*,
Replace: yes
... Jenkins runs under Jetty, Jetty supports
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7239[RFC7239], so all should be well.
. Under Action change:
..  Rewrite URL to
*\{C:1}\://jenkins.acme.example:8080\{UNENCODED_URL}*
... Note that there is no slash between the port number and the opening
curly bracket
.. *Remove* the check from the *Append query string* checkbox
. Apply the changes.
. Edit _C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts_ so that
*jenkins.acme.example* points to 127.0.0.1
.. When resolving names Windows will check if the name is its own name
before consulting the hosts file. Meaning that adding _vrtjenkins01_ or
_vrtjenkins01.acme.example_ to the hosts file won't have any effect.
... The hosts file will however be consulted before consulting the DNS
infrastructure

=== Experiencing the dreaded "It appears that your reverse proxy set up is broken." error for yourself

. \https://jenkins.acme.example/configure
. Configure the _Jenkins URL_ to
be **\https://jenkins.acme.example/**
and save the change
. Go to _Configure Global Security_ and enable
_Enable proxy compatibility_ if you have already enabled _Prevent Cross
Site Request Forgery exploits_
. Go to \https://jenkins.acme.example/manage
. You will still experience the "It appears that your reverse
proxy set up is broken." as expected
.. If you do not get that at this point, then that is very weird...
Continue anyway.
. Right click the _Configure System_ link and choose to
inspect the element.
.. Make sure you are still on the Manage page as you will want
it as your referrer
. Change the value of the _href_ attribute to be
_administrativeMonitor/hudson.diagnosis.ReverseProxySetupMonitor/test_
. Open the link you just changed in a new tab.
.. Keep this tab open
. Observe the "\https://jenkins.acme.example/manage
vs http:" error and bask in its glory
.. a white page served with HTTP status code is 200 indicates
all is well
... If you do get that at this point, then that is very
weird... Continue anyway.

=== Fixing the errors

. In IIS Manager got to _Application Pools_ then edit
_DefaultAppPool_ so that the _.NET CLR version_ is *No Managed Code*
.. You might find that this is not necessary (at far as you
can tell) for your setup, since IIS will only act as a TLS/SSL
offloading reverse proxy, we don't need it.
. Then go to _Sites_ → _Default Web Site_ → _Request
Filtering_ and in the _Actions_ panel choose _Edit Feature Settings..._
and turn on *Allow doube escaping*
.. This is so IIS forwards URLs like
\https://jenkins.acme.example/%2525 to Jenkins instead of
showing an IIS error page
. Last, but not least, go to _Sites_ → _Default Web
Site_ → __Configuration Editor__ and change the _Section_ to
_system.webServer/rewrite/rules_
. Now you should see the URL Rewrite 2.1 property
_useOriginalURLEncoding_ listed, if not install URL Rewrite 2.1 using
the x86 or x64 installer, not the WebPI one and resume from here after a
reboot.
. Change _useOriginalURLEncoding_ to *False*
.. As the URL Rewrite 2.1 announcement this will change the
value of \{UNENCODED_URL} to make it _RFC3986_ and usable for reverse
proxy forwarding purposes
.. original as in pre 2.1 behaviour.
. Refresh that tab you were supposed to keep open, or recreate
it.
.. Again, take some time to bask in its glory
. It should now be white, also the Manage page should no
longer complain!

=== Continue configuring IIS

Some of the things you might want but I won't cover:

* _Hypertext Strict Transport Security_ headers
* Redirecting from non canonical URLs to the canonical URL
(ok, sort of covered this in the web.config example)
* The X-UA-Compatibility header so that Internet Explorer 11
(or 9, or ...) won't claim to be IE 7 for intranet sites
* Use IIS Crypto to configure cipher suites
* ...

=== A working web.config

*web.config*
