=== Archive unused jobs
Sometimes you want to remove a job from Jenkins but do so in such a way that you can resurrect it later, if the need arises.
You can do this by going to `$JENKINS_HOME` and creating an archive of the job directory.
The following command illustrates how to archive a job 'xyz' and remove it.
