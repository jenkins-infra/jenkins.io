Matrix-based security is one of the authorization strategies available
for https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/system-administration/security/[securing
Jenkins]. It allows you to grant specific permissions to users and
groups. 

[NOTE]
====
Matrix-based Authorization Strategy is provided
by the plugin:matrix-auth[Matrix Authorization Strategy Plugin]
and may not be installed on your Jenkins.
====

For most Jenkins environments, matrix-based security provides the most security
and flexibility so it is recommended as a starting point for "production"
environments.

The table shown above can get quite wide as each column represents a permission
provided by Jenkins core or a plugin. Hovering the mouse over a permission will
display more information about the permission.

Each row in the table represents a user or group (also known as a "role"). This
includes special entries named "anonymous" and "authenticated." The "anonymous"
entry represents permissions granted to all unauthenticated users accessing the
Jenkins environment. Whereas "authenticated' can be used to grant permissions
to all authenticated users accessing the environment.

The permissions granted in the matrix are additive. For example, if a user
"kohsuke" is in the groups "developers" and "administrators", then the
permissions granted to "kohsuke" will be a union of all those permissions
granted to "kohsuke", "developers", "administrators", "authenticated", and
"anonymous."

The most common available permissions are listed below with their
descriptions, and are also available by hovering over the permission
heading in the Jenkins UI. Other plugins may add their own permissions.
