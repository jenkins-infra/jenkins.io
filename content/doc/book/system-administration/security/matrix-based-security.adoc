Matrix-based security is one of the authorization strategies available for link:/doc/book/system-administration/security[securing Jenkins].  It allows you to grant specific permissions to users and groups.  The available permissions are listed below with their descriptions, and are also available by hovering over the permission heading in the Jenkins UI.

*Note:* These are the most common permissions available.  Other plugins may add their own permissions.

== Overall

[IMPORTANT]
====
Several of these permissions are at least as powerful as Administer, but for historical reasons are implied by the Administer permission (i.e. everyone with Administer can also perform the actions associated with these other permissions):

* *RunScripts* allows executing arbitrary code in the context of any (Jenkins internal) user, including the internal SYSTEM user.
* *UploadPlugins* allows uploading plugins, which in turn can execute arbitrary code in the context of any (Jenkins internal) user.
* *ConfigureUpdateCenter* can configure proxy settings and thereby control the update site metadata and plugin files downloaded by the Jenkins plugin manager, which in turn can be used to execute arbitrary code.
