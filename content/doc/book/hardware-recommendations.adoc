== Hardware Recommendations

=== Introduction

Sizing a Jenkins environment depends on a number of factors, which makes it a
very inexact science. Achieving an optimal configuration requires some
experience and experimentation. It is, however, possible to make a smart
approximation to start - especially when designing with Jenkins' best practices
in mind.

The following outlines these factors and how you can account for them when
sizing your configuration. You are also provided sample configurations and the
hardwares behind some of the largest Jenkins installations presented in a
Jenkins Scalability Summit.

=== Choosing the Right Hardware for Masters

One of the greatest challenges of properly setting up a Jenkins instance is that
there is no _one size fits all_ answer - the exact specifications of the
hardware that you will need will depend heavily on your organization's current
and future needs.

Your Jenkins master will be serving HTTP requests and storing all of the
important information for your Jenkins instance in its _$JENKINS_HOME_ folder
(configurations, build histories and plugins).

More information on sizing masters based organizational needs can be found in
the link:../architecting-for-scale[Architecting for Scale] section.

==== Memory Requirements for the Master

The amount of memory Jenkins needs is largely dependent on many factors, which
is why the RAM allotted for it can range from 200 MB for a small installation to
70+ GB for a single and massive Jenkins master. However, you should be able to
estimate the RAM required based on your project build needs.

Each build node connection will take 2-3 threads, which equals about 2 MB or
more of memory. You will also need to factor in CPU overhead for Jenkins if
there are a lot of users who will be accessing the Jenkins user interface.

It is generally a bad practice to allocate executors on a master, as builds can
quickly overload a master's CPU/memory/etc and crash the instance, causing
unnecessary downtime. Instead, it is advisable to set up agents that the Jenkins
master can delegate jobs to, keeping the bulk of the work off of the
master itself.


=== Choosing the Right Build Machines

The backbone of Jenkins is its ability to orchestrate builds, but installations
which do not leverage Jenkins' distributed builds architecture are artificially
limiting the number of builds that their masters can orchestrate. More
information on link:../architecting-for-scale#distributed-builds-architecture[a more
distributed architecture] can be found in the
link:../architecting-for-scale[Architecting for Scale] section.

==== Requirements for a Machine to be an agent

[[fungibility]]
Agents are typically generic x86 machines with enough memory to run
specific build types. The agent's configuration depends on the builds it
will be used for and on the tools required by the same builds.

Configuring a machine to act as an agent inside your infrastructure can be tedious
and time consuming. This is especially true when the same set-up has to be
replicated on a large pool of agents. Because of this, is ideal to have fungible
agents, which are agents that are easily replaceable. Agentsshould be generic
for all builds rather customized for a specific job or a set of jobs. The more
generic the agents, the more easily they are interchanged, which in turn
allows for a better use of resources and a reduced impact on productivity if
some agents suffer an outage. Andrew Bayer introduced this concept of
"fungibility" as applied to agents during his presentation
http://www.slideshare.net/andrewbayer/seven-habits-of-highly-effective-jenkins-users-2014-edition["Seven
Habits of Highly Effective Jenkins Users" at the Jenkins User Conference
(Europe, 2014)].

The more automated the environment configuration is, the easier it is to
replicate a configuration onto a new agent machine. Tools for configuration
management or a pre-baked image can be excellent solutions to this end.
Containers and virtualization are also popular tools for creating generic agent
environments.

More information on estimating the number of executors needed in a given
environment can be found in the link:../architecting-for-scale[Architecting for
Scale] section.
