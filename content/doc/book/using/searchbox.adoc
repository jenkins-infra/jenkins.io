= Using Search Box

Every page in Jenkins has a search box on its top right that lets you get to your destination quickly, without multiple clicks.

For example, if you type "foo #53 console", you'll be taken to the console output page of the "foo" job build #53. Or if you have "XYZ" view, just type "XYZ" to get to that view. The search box comes with auto-completion to assist you.

The search box is also context sensitive. If you are already somewhere in the foo job (perhaps you are looking at another build), then you can just type "#53 console" instead of "foo #53 console". If you are already somewhere in the foo #53 (maybe you are looking at test report), then you can just type "console" to get to the same page.

[[SearchBox-Caseinsensitivesearch]]
=== Case insensitive search

If you want the search box to be case insensitive, go to your profile configuration page (/jenkins/user/<your profile>/configure) and activate the corresponding option.

Please note that case-insensitive search is not available for anonymous (not logged in) users.

[[SearchBox-OpenSearchsupport]]
=== OpenSearch support

This search box feature is also exposed to the browser through http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenSearch[OpenSearch], so you can install this search and auto-completion feature to your browser search box. This would further reduce the overhead it takes for you to visit a particular page in Jenkins.

For example in Firefox, you can add the Jenkins search to your browser's search engines via the dropdown on the right of the address bar:

=== Feedback appreciated

There's always a room for improvements in how Jenkins associates search terms with actual pages. Your feedback is appreciated.
