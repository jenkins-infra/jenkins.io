title: Aborting a build

= Aborting a build

When you click that [x] icon from the UI, the following things happen:

. Browser sends a request to the server.
. The server interrupts (via Thread.interrupt()) the thread (AKA
executor thread) that is responsible for carrying out a build.
. The server returns

At this point, your browser is back, but the actual abort process
happens from here asynchronously.

. The thread gets the interrupt signal. How quickly this happens depends
on what the executor is doing at the time of the interruption.
Specifically, an executor thread can only be interrupted in
"interruption points" due to the Java design.
* Waiting for a completion of a child process (for example, maybe the
build is running Ant) is an interruption point. That means if the
executor was doing that, it gets interrupted instantaneously.
* Waiting for a computation on a slave is an interruption point.
* Waiting for file or network I/O is not an interruption point. This
often causes the problem where a build appears to be un-abortable. For
example, checking out a Subversion repository falls in this category.
* Normal computation is also not an interruption point.
. The executor performs a clean up operation. This depends on what it
was doing by the time it noticed the interruption.
* If it was waiting for a completion of a child process, Jenkins will
search for all the descendant processes and kill them all. On Unix, this
is done through `+java.lang.UnixProcess.destroyProcess+`, which sends
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIGTERM[SIGTERM] on Unix-based JDK implementations. On Windows,
this is done through
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms686714(VS.85).aspx[TerminateProcess]
API.
* If it was waiting for a completion of some computation in an agent, the
thread that's performing the remote computation is interrupted
asynchronously. How quickly that threads gets interrupted depends on
what that thread is doing. See above.
. Executor starts unwinding the stack, and eventually it finishes the
unwinding. At this point, the build is marked as aborted and executor
returns to the idle status.

Pipeline jobs can by stopped by sending an HTTP POST request to URL
endpoints of a build.

* `+BUILD ID URL/stop+` - aborts a Pipeline.
* `+BUILD ID URL/term+` - forcibly terminates a build (should only be
used if `+stop+` does not work).
* `+BUILD ID URL/kill+` - hard kill a pipeline. This is the most
destructive way to stop a pipeline and should only be used as a last
resort.

== If your build isn't aborting

Check the thread dump `+http://yourserver/jenkins/threadDump+` and
look for the executor thread in question â€” they are named after the
agent and executor number. That'll normally tell you where the thread
is, and often reveals why it's not responding to an interruption.
