= Using local language

Jenkins displays text depending on the language of the browser.
It detects the language of your internet browser.

Note that, depending on the browser and on the language, you might need to download addons.

You can additionally change the system language (used when builds are executing), as well as the user interface language for all users by using the plugin:locale[Locale Plugin].
