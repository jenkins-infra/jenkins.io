= Contributing to Jenkins

In this chapter, we'll discuss how you can contribute to the Jenkins project.
This will include everything from the basics, such as how to get help with Jenkins,
all the way to advanced topics, such as how to develop Jenkins plugins and submit changes
to Jenkins itself.

The intended audience is generally experienced users, administrators, and engineers, but even
beginners can contribute to the project, for example, by joining in discussions, filing
high-quality bugs, or writing documentation.
