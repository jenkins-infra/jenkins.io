title: Upgrading to Java 11
---

When upgrading the JVM used to run Jenkins from Java 8 to Java 11, there are some details you should know and precautions you should take.

== Backing up Jenkins

As with any upgrade, we recommend:
 
. link:https:/doc/book/system-administration/backing-up/#jenkins_home[Backing up `JENKINS_HOME`].
. Testing the upgrade with your backup.
. Only after all required tests pass, performing the upgrade on your production instance.

If you need to upgrade Jenkins, as well as the JVM, we recommend you:

. link:/doc/book/system-administration/backing-up/#jenkins_home[Back up `JENKINS_HOME`].
. Stop the Jenkins instance.
. Upgrade the JVM on which Jenkins is running.
** Use a package manager to install the new JVM.
** Ensure the default JVM is the newly installed version.
*** If it is not, run `systemctl edit jenkins`, and set either the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable or the `JENKINS_JAVA_CMD` environment variable.
. Upgrade Jenkins to the most recent version.
** How you upgrade Jenkins is dependent upon your original Jenkins installation method.
+
TIP: We recommend that you use the package manager of your system (such as `apt` or `yum`).
. Validate the upgrade to confirm that all plugins and jobs are loaded.
. Upgrade the required plugins.
Refer to <<Upgrading Plugins>> for further information.

Starting with Jenkins releases 2.357 and LTS 2.361.1, Java 11 or Java 17 is required.

== Upgrading Plugins

When upgrading the Java version for Jenkins and the JVM, it is important to upgrade all plugins that support Java 11.
Plugin upgrades assure compatibility with the most recent Jenkins releases.

NOTE: If you discover a previously unreported issue, please let us know. Refer to link:/participate/report-issue/#issue-reporting[how to report an issue] for guidance.

// Commented because pipeline support plugin 3.0 is over 3 years old and has 8+ later releases
//
// One of the most important plugin upgrades is the plugin:workflow-support[Pipeline: Support plugin]: make sure that the version of the plugin is at least `3.0`.
//
// NOTE: Stop all Pipeline jobs before upgrading this plugin because this upgrade changes the serialization of Pipeline builds. As a general rule, even though Pipeline jobs are supposed to survive a Jenkins restart, it's always a better option to make sure that no Pipeline builds are in progress before any scheduled Jenkins maintenance.

== Jakarta XML Binding

Some plugins use JAXB libraries provided by the JDK.
However, the `java.xml.bind` and `javax.activation` modules are no longer included in OpenJDK 11, and plugins might fail if no replacement is offered.

To fix this problem, we've bundled those libraries into a new detached plugin: plugin:jaxb[JAXB plugin].
When any Jenkins core more recent than `2.163` is running on Java 11, this plugin is automatically installed.
However, if you manage your plugins outside Jenkins, for example using a `plugins.txt` in your Docker images, you might need to install the plugin explicitly.

== JVM version on agents

All agents must be running on the same JVM version as the controller due to how controllers and agents communicate.
If you're upgrading your Jenkins controller to run on Java 11, you must upgrade the JVM on your agents.

You can validate the version of each agent with the plugin:versioncolumn[Versions Node Monitors] plugin.
This plugin provides information about the JVM version of each agent on the node management screen of your Jenkins instance.
You can also configure this plugin to automatically disconnect any agent with an incorrect JVM version.

== Java Web Start

Java Web Start has been removed in Java 11.
When a Jenkins controller runs on Java 11, the Java Web Start button will no longer appear in the Web UI.
You can't launch agents for a Java 11 Jenkins controller from a `*.jnlp` file downloaded to a web browser.

There are no plans to replace this functionality.
Connect agents to Jenkins on Java 11 with plugins like plugin:ssh-slaves[SSH Build Agents Plugin], with operating system command line calls to `java -jar agent.jar`, or using containers.

== JDK Tool Installer

Oracle JDK 11 licensing prevents the Jenkins community from listing the Oracle JDKs.
Because of this licensing restriction, Oracle JDK 11 can't be automatically installed by Jenkins. 
This problem is tracked in the issue link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-54305[JENKINS-54305].

As an alternative, we encourage you to use containers based on images that contain all the tooling needed for your builds.
