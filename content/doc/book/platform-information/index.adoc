This chapter provides information about the operating systems, web browsers, Java versions, and other software components commonly used to run Jenkins.

The content is suitable for users of all levels, especially those getting started with Jenkins.

== Support policies

The Jenkins project defines support levels for platform components such as Java versions, operating systems, web browsers, and servlet containers.
Support levels provide guidance on the effort Jenkins project contributors generally apply to issues related to platform components.

Details of the support policies are available in the specific support policy pages:

* link:/doc/book/platform-information/support-policy-java/[Java]
* link:/doc/book/platform-information/support-policy-linux/[Linux]
* link:/doc/book/platform-information/support-policy-windows/[Windows]
* link:/doc/book/platform-information/support-policy-servlet-containers/[Servlet containers]
* link:/doc/book/platform-information/support-policy-web-browsers/[Web browsers]

== Java support and upgrade information

In addition to support policies, this chapter provides information on upgrading your Java version in Jenkins.
Depending on your current Java version, there are instructions for link:/doc/book/platform-information/upgrade-java-to-17/[upgrading to Java 17] and link:/doc/book/platform-information/upgrade-java-to-21/[upgrading to Java 21].
