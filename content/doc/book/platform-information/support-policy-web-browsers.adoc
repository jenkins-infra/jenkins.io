title:  Browser compatibility

This page documents the browser support policy for Jenkins controllers.
NOTE: Content here does not apply to the Jenkins website or other services hosted by the Jenkins project.

== Support model

Jenkins web browser support falls into one of three levels:

. Level 1: Aim to proactively support these browsers and provide an equal
UX across all.
. Level 2: Accept patches to fix issues and make the best effort to
ensure there is at least one way to do any action.
. Level 3: No guarantees. We will accept patches, but only if they are
low risk. *This is the default unless a browser/version is listed
below*.

We do not claim any compatibility with or accept bug reports and
patches for pre-release (e.g., alpha, beta, or canary) versions of
browsers.
