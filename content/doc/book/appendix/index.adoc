= Appendix

These sections are generally intended for Jenkins administrators and system administrators.
Each section covers a different topic independent of the other sections.
They are advanced topics, reference material, and topics that do not fit into other chapters.

[WARNING]
====
*To Contributors*: Please consider adding material elsewhere before adding it here.
In fact, topics that do not fit elsewhere may even be out of scope for this handbook. See
link:/participate[Contributing to Jenkins] for details of how to contact
project contributors and discuss what you want to add.
