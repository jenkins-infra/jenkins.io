The procedures in this chapter are for upgrading Jenkins.

Jenkins can be installed with operating system specific installers like link:https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/windows/#windows-msi-installers[MSI], link:https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/#red-hat-centos[RPM], and link:https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/#debianubuntu[DEB] installers.
When upgrading Jenkins, the process used must match the original installation method:

* If Jenkins was installed with an operating system specific Linux installer, it should be upgraded with the same operating system specific Linux installer
* If Jenkins was installed with the Windows installer, it should be upgraded using the upgrade selection inside Jenkins
* If Jenkins was installed as a standalone application, it should be upgraded as a standalone application
