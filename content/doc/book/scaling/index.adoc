= Scaling Jenkins

See the current architectural scaling recommendations in *link:../architecting-for-scale[Architecting for Scale]*.

This chapter will cover topics related to using and managing large scale Jenkins
configurations: large numbers of users, nodes, agents, folders, projects,
concurrent jobs, job results and logs, and even large numbers of masters.

The audience for this chapter is expert Jenkins users, administrators, and those
planning large-scale installations.

If you are a Jenkins administrator and want to know more about managing Jenkins nodes and instances, see
<<managing#,Managing Jenkins>>.

For an overview of content in the Jenkins User Handbook, see
<<getting-started#,User Handbook overview>>.
