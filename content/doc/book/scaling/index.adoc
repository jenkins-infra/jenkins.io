= Scaling Jenkins

This chapter covers topics related to using and managing large scale Jenkins
configurations: large numbers of users, nodes, agents, folders, projects,
concurrent jobs, job results and logs, and even large numbers of Jenkins controllers.

The audience for this chapter is expert Jenkins users, administrators, and those
planning large-scale installations.

If you are a Jenkins administrator and want to know more about managing Jenkins nodes and instances, see
<<managing#,Managing Jenkins>>.
