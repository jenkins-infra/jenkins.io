== FreeBSD

Jenkins can be installed on FreeBSD using the standard FreeBSD package manager, `pkg`.

=== Long Term Support release

A link:/download/lts/[LTS (Long-Term Support) release] is chosen every 12 weeks from the stream of regular releases as the stable release for that time period.
It can be installed from the FreeBSD `pkg` package manager.

[source,bash,width=50%]
----
# pkg install jenkins-lts
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Disclaimer: The link:https://www.freebsd.org/[FreeBSD project] maintains the Jenkins packaging for FreeBSD.
The Jenkins package for FreeBSD is NOT officially supported by the Jenkins project,
but it is actively used by the link:https://www.freebsd.org/[FreeBSD project] at https://ci.freebsd.org/ .
====

=== Weekly release

A new release is produced weekly to deliver bug fixes and features to users and plugin developers.
It can be installed from the FreeBSD `pkg` package manager.

[source,bash]
----
# pkg install jenkins
----

The long term support package `jenkins-lts` and the weekly package installation `jenkins` will:

* Configure Jenkins as a daemon which may optionally be launched on start. See `/etc/rc.conf` for more details
* Create a '`jenkins`' user to run the service
* Direct console log output to the file `/var/log/jenkins.log`. Check this file when troubleshooting Jenkins
* Set Jenkins to listen on port 8180 from the path `/jenkins`.  Open \http://localhost:8180/jenkins to login to Jenkins

=== Start Jenkins

You can start the Jenkins service with the command:

[source,bash]
----
# service jenkins onestart
----

You can check the status of the Jenkins service using the command:

[source,bash]
----
# service jenkins status
----

You can stop the Jenkins service with the command:

[source,bash]
----
# service jenkins stop
----

=== Enable Jenkins

Add the following to `/etc/rc.conf` to start Jenkins automatically on system boot:

[source,bash]
----
jenkins_enable="YES"
----

Once Jenkins is enabled, it can be started with:

[source,bash]
----
# service jenkins start
----

Other configuration values that can be set in `/etc/rc.conf` or in `/etc/rc.conf.d/jenkins` are described in `/usr/local/etc/rc.d/jenkins`.
Refer to the link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/Jenkins[Jenkins page] on the link:https://wiki.freebsd.org/[FreeBSD wiki] for more information specific to Jenkins on FreeBSD.


== OpenIndiana Hipster

On a system running link:https://www.openindiana.org/[OpenIndiana Hipster]
Jenkins can be installed in either the local or global zone using the
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_Packaging_System[Image Packaging
System] (IPS).

[IMPORTANT]
====
Disclaimer: This platform is NOT officially supported by the Jenkins team,
use it at your own risk. Packaging and integration described in this section
is maintained by the OpenIndiana Hipster team, bundling the generic `jenkins.war`
to work in that operating environment.
====

For the common case of running the newest packaged weekly build as a standalone (Jetty) server, simply execute:

[source,bash]
----
pkg install jenkins
svcadm enable jenkins
----

The common packaging integration for a standalone service will:

* Create a `jenkins` user to run the service and to own the directory structures under `/var/lib/jenkins`.
* Pull the Java package and other packages required to execute Jenkins, including
  the `jenkins-core-weekly` package with the latest `jenkins.war`.
* Set up Jenkins as an SMF service instance (`svc:/network/http:jenkins`) which
  can then be enabled with the `svcadm` command demonstrated above.
* Set up Jenkins to listen on port 8080.
* Configure the log output to be managed by SMF at `/var/svc/log/network-http:jenkins.log`.

Once Jenkins is running, consult the log
(`/var/svc/log/network-http:jenkins.log`) to retrieve the generated
administrator password for the initial set up of Jenkins, usually it will be
found at `/var/lib/jenkins/home/secrets/initialAdminPassword`. Then navigate to
link:http://localhost:8080[localhost:8080] to <<setup-wizard, complete configuration of the
Jenkins instance>>.


To change attributes of the service, such as environment variables like `JENKINS_HOME`
or the port number used for the Jetty web server, use the `svccfg` utility:

[source,bash]
----
svccfg -s svc:/network/http:jenkins editprop
svcadm refresh svc:/network/http:jenkins
----

You can also refer to `/lib/svc/manifest/network/jenkins-standalone.xml` for more
details and comments about currently supported tunables of the SMF service.
Note that the `jenkins` user account created by the packaging is specially privileged
to allow binding to port numbers under 1024.

The current status of Jenkins-related packages available for the given release
of OpenIndiana can be queried with:

[source,bash]
----
pkg info -r '*jenkins*'
----

Upgrades to the package can be performed by updating the entire operating
environment with `pkg update`, or specifically for Jenkins core software with:

[source,bash]
----
pkg update jenkins-core-weekly
----

[CAUTION]
====
Procedure for updating the package will restart the currently running Jenkins
process. Make sure to prepare it for shutdown and finish all running jobs
before updating, if needed.
====


== Solaris, OmniOS, SmartOS, and other siblings

Generally it should suffice to install a link:/doc/book/platform-information/support-policy-java/[supported Java version], link:/download[download] the
`jenkins.war`, and run it as a standalone process.


Some caveats apply:

* Headless JVM and fonts: For OpenJDK builds on minimalized-footprint systems,
  there may be
  link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+got+java.awt.headless+problem[issues
  running the headless JVM], because Jenkins needs some fonts to render certain
  pages.
