==== On macOS and Linux

. Open up a terminal window.
. Create a link:https://docs.docker.com/network/bridge/[bridge network] in
  Docker using the following
  link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/network_create/[`docker network create`]
  command:
+
[source,bash]
----
docker network create jenkins
----
. In order to execute Docker commands inside Jenkins nodes, download and run
  the `docker:dind` Docker image using the following
  link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/ [`docker run`]
  command:
+
[source,bash]
----
docker run \
  --name jenkins-docker \# <1>
  --rm \# <2>
  --detach \# <3>
  --privileged \# <4>
  --network jenkins \# <5>
  --network-alias docker \# <6>
  --env DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR=/certs \# <7>
  --volume jenkins-docker-certs:/certs/client \# <8>
  --volume jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home \# <9>
  --publish 3000:3000 \# <10>
  --publish 2376:2376 \# <11>
  docker:dind# <12>
----
<1> ( _Optional_ ) Specifies the Docker container name to use for running the
image. By default, Docker will generate a unique name for the container.
<2> ( _Optional_ ) Automatically removes the Docker container (the instance of
the Docker image) when it is shut down.
<3> ( _Optional_ ) Runs the Docker container in the background. This instance
can be stopped later by running `docker stop jenkins-docker`.
<4> Running Docker in Docker currently requires privileged access to function
properly. This requirement may be relaxed with newer Linux kernel versions.
// TODO: what versions of Linux?
<5> This corresponds with the network created in the earlier step.
<6> Makes the Docker in Docker container available as the hostname `docker`
within the `jenkins` network.
<7> Enables the use of TLS in the Docker server. Due to the use
of a privileged container, this is recommended, though it requires the use of
the shared volume described below. This environment variable controls the root
directory where Docker TLS certificates are managed.
<8> Maps the `/certs/client` directory inside the container to
a Docker volume named `jenkins-docker-certs` as created above.
<9> Maps the `/var/jenkins_home` directory inside the container to the Docker
volume named `jenkins-data`. This will allow for other Docker
containers controlled by this Docker container's Docker daemon to mount data
from Jenkins.
<10> Exposes the Docker daemon port, used by some of tutorials.
<11> ( _Optional_ ) Exposes the Docker daemon port on the host machine. This is
useful for executing `docker` commands on the host machine to control this
inner Docker daemon.
<12> The `docker:dind` image itself. This image can be downloaded before running
by using the command: `docker image pull docker:dind`.

  --volume jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home \
  --publish 3000:3000 \
  --publish 2376:2376 docker:dind
----
. Customise official Jenkins Docker image, by executing below two steps:
.. Create Dockerfile with the following content:
+
[source]
----
FROM jenkins/jenkins:2.263.2-lts-jdk11
USER root
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y apt-transport-https \
       ca-certificates curl gnupg2 \
       software-properties-common
RUN curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | apt-key add -
RUN apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88
RUN add-apt-repository \
       "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian \
       $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y docker-ce-cli
USER jenkins
RUN jenkins-plugin-cli --plugins blueocean:1.24.3
----
.. Build a new docker image from this Dockerfile and assign the image a meaningful name, e.g. "myjenkins-blueocean:1.1":
+
[source,bash]
----
docker build -t myjenkins-blueocean:1.1 .
----
Keep in mind that the process described above will automatically download the official Jenkins Docker image
if this hasn't been done before.

. Run your own `myjenkins-blueocean:1.1` image as a container in Docker using the
  following
  link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/[`docker run`]
  command:
+
[source,bash]
----
docker run \
  --name jenkins-blueocean \# <1>
  --rm \# <2>
  --detach \# <3>
  --network jenkins \# <4>
  --env DOCKER_HOST=tcp://docker:2376 \# <5>
  --env DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/certs/client \
  --env DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1 \
  --publish 8080:8080 \# <6>
  --publish 50000:50000 \# <7>
  --volume jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home \# <8>
  --volume jenkins-docker-certs:/certs/client:ro \# <9>
  --volume "$HOME":/home \# <10>
  myjenkins-blueocean:1.1 # <11>
----
<1> ( _Optional_ ) Specifies the Docker container name for this instance of
the Docker image.
<2> ( _Optional_ ) Automatically removes the Docker container when it is shut down.
<3> ( _Optional_ ) Runs the current container in the background
(i.e. "detached" mode) and outputs the container ID. If you do not specify this
option, then the running Docker log for this container is output in the terminal
window.
<4> Connects this container to the `jenkins` network defined in the earlier
step. This makes the Docker daemon from the previous step available to this
Jenkins container through the hostname `docker`.
<5> Specifies the environment variables used by `docker`, `docker-compose`, and
other Docker tools to connect to the Docker daemon from the previous step.
<6> Maps (i.e. "publishes") port 8080 of the current container to
port 8080 on the host machine. The first number represents the port on the host
while the last represents the container's port. Therefore, if you specified `-p
49000:8080` for this option, you would be accessing Jenkins on your host machine
through port 49000.
<7> ( _Optional_ ) Maps port 50000 of the current container to
port 50000 on the host machine. This is only necessary if you have set up one or
more inbound Jenkins agents on other machines, which in turn interact with
your `jenkins-blueocean` container (the Jenkins "controller").
Inbound Jenkins agents communicate with the Jenkins
controller through TCP port 50000 by default. You can change this port number on
your Jenkins controller through the <<managing/security#,Configure Global Security>>
page. If you were to change the *TCP port for inbound Jenkins agents* of your Jenkins controller
to 51000 (for example), then you would need to re-run Jenkins (via this
`docker run ...` command) and specify this "publish" option with something like
`--publish 52000:51000`, where the last value matches this changed value on the
Jenkins controller and the first value is the port number on the machine hosting
the Jenkins controller. Inbound Jenkins agents communicate with the
Jenkins controller on that port (52000 in this example).
Note that link:/blog/2020/02/02/web-socket/[WebSocket agents] do not need this configuration.
<8> Maps the `/var/jenkins_home` directory in the container to the Docker
link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/volumes/volumes/[volume] with the name
`jenkins-data`. Instead of mapping the `/var/jenkins_home` directory to a Docker
volume, you could also map this directory to one on your machine's local file
system. For example, specifying the option +
`--volume $HOME/jenkins:/var/jenkins_home` would map the container's
`/var/jenkins_home` directory to the `jenkins` subdirectory within the `$HOME`
directory on your local machine, which would typically be
`/Users/<your-username>/jenkins` or `/home/<your-username>/jenkins`.
Note that if you change the source volume or directory for this, the volume
from the `docker:dind` container above needs to be updated to match this.
<9> Maps the `/certs/client` directory to the previously created
`jenkins-docker-certs` volume. This makes the client TLS certificates needed
to connect to the Docker daemon available in the path specified by the
`DOCKER_CERT_PATH` environment variable.
<10> Maps the `$HOME` directory on the host (i.e. your local) machine (usually
the `/Users/<your-username>` directory) to the `/home` directory in the
container.
<11> The name of the Docker image, which you built in the previous step.

. Proceed to the <<setup-wizard,Post-installation setup wizard>>.


==== On Windows

The Jenkins project provides a Linux container image, not a Windows container image.
Be sure that your Docker for Windows installation is configured to run `Linux Containers` rather than `Windows Containers`.
See the Docker documentation for instructions to link:https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#switch-between-windows-and-linux-containers[switch to Linux containers].
Once configured to run `Linux Containers`, the steps are:

. Open up a command prompt window and similar to the <<on-macos-and-linux,macOS and Linux>> instructions above do the following:
. Create a bridge network in Docker
+
[source,bash]
----
docker network create jenkins
----
. Run a docker:dind Docker image
+
[source]
----
docker run --name jenkins-docker --rm --detach ^
  --privileged --network jenkins --network-alias docker ^
  --env DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR=/certs ^
  --volume jenkins-docker-certs:/certs/client ^
  --volume jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home ^
  docker:dind
----
. Build a customised official Jenkins Docker image using above Dockerfile and `docker build` command.

. Run your own `myjenkins-blueocean:1.1` image as a container in Docker using the following
  link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/[`docker run`]
  command:
+
[source]
----
docker run --name jenkins-blueocean --rm --detach ^
  --network jenkins --env DOCKER_HOST=tcp://docker:2376 ^
  --env DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/certs/client --env DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1 ^
  --volume jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home ^
  --volume jenkins-docker-certs:/certs/client:ro ^
  --volume "%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%":/home ^
  --publish 8080:8080 --publish 50000:50000 myjenkins-blueocean:1.1
----
. Proceed to the <<setup-wizard,Setup wizard>>.

[[accessing-the-jenkins-blue-ocean-docker-container]]
==== Accessing the Docker container

If you have some experience with Docker and you wish or need to access your
Docker container through a terminal/command prompt using the
link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec/[`docker exec`]
command, you can add an option like `--name jenkins-tutorial` to the `docker exec` command.
That will access the Jenkins Docker container named "jenkins-tutorial".

This means you could access your docker container (through a separate
terminal/command prompt window) with a `docker exec` command like:

`docker exec -it jenkins-blueocean bash`

[[accessing-the-jenkins-console-log-through-docker-logs]]
==== Accessing the Docker logs

There is a possibility you may need to access the Jenkins console log, for
instance, when <<unlocking-jenkins,Unlocking Jenkins>> as part of the
<<setup-wizard,Post-installation setup wizard>>.

The Jenkins console log is easily accessible through the terminal/command
prompt window from which you executed the `docker run ...` command.
In case if needed you can also access the Jenkins console log through the
link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/logs/[Docker logs] of
your container using the following command:

`docker logs <docker-container-name>`

Your `<docker-container-name>` can be obtained using the `docker ps` command.


==== Accessing the Jenkins home directory

There is a possibility you may need to access the Jenkins home directory, for
instance, to check the details of a Jenkins build in the `workspace`
subdirectory.

If you mapped the Jenkins home directory (`/var/jenkins_home`) to one on your
machine's local file system (i.e. in the `docker run ...` command
<<downloading-and-running-jenkins-in-docker,above>>), then you can access the
contents of this directory through your machine's usual terminal/command prompt.

Otherwise, if you specified the `--volume jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home` option in
the `docker run ...` command, you can access the contents of the Jenkins home
directory through your container's terminal/command prompt using the
link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/container_exec/[`docker container exec`]
command:

`docker container exec -it <docker-container-name> bash`

As mentioned <<accessing-the-jenkins-console-log-through-docker-logs,above>>,
your `<docker-container-name>` can be obtained using the
link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/container_ls/[`docker container ls`]
command. If you specified the +
`--name jenkins-blueocean` option in the `docker container run ...`
command above (see also
<<accessing-the-jenkins-blue-ocean-docker-container,Accessing the Jenkins/Blue
Ocean Docker container>>), you can simply use the `docker container exec` command:

`docker container exec -it jenkins-blueocean bash`

////
Might wish to add explaining the `docker run -t` option, which was covered in
the old installation instructions but not above.

Also mention that spinning up a container of the `jenkins/jenkins` Docker
image can be done so with all the same
https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker#usage[configuration options] available to
the other images published by the Jenkins project.

Explain colon syntax on Docker image references like
`jenkins/jenkins:latest'.
