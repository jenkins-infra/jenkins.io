==== On macOS and Linux

. Open up a terminal window.
. Run the `jenkinsci/blueocean` image as a container in Docker using the
  following
  link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/[`docker run`]
  command (bearing in mind that this command automatically downloads the image
  if this hasn't been done):
+
[source]
----
docker run \
  --rm \
  -u root \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home \ # <1>
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  -v "$HOME":/home \ # <2>
  jenkinsci/blueocean
----
<1> Maps the `/var/jenkins_home` directory in the container to the Docker
link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/volumes/volumes/[volume] with the name
`jenkins-data`. If this volume does not exist, then this `docker run` command
will automatically create the volume for you.
<2> Maps the `$HOME` directory on the host (i.e. your local) machine (usually
the `/Users/<your-username>` directory) to the `/home` directory in the
container.

. Proceed to the <<setup-wizard,Setup wizard>>.


==== On Windows

. Open up a command prompt window.
. Run the `jenkinsci/blueocean` image as a container in Docker using the
  following
  link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/[`docker run`]
  command (bearing in mind that this command automatically downloads the image
  if this hasn't been done):
+
----
docker run ^
  --rm ^
  -u root ^
  -p 8080:8080 ^
  -v jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home ^
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock ^
  -v "%HOMEPATH%":/home ^
  jenkinsci/blueocean

==== Accessing the Jenkins/Blue Ocean Docker container

If you have some experience with Docker and you wish or need to access the
Jenkins/Blue Ocean Docker container through a terminal/command prompt using the
link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/exec/[`docker exec`]
command, you can add an option like `--name jenkins-tutorials` (with the
link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/[`docker run`]
above), which would give the Jenkins/Blue Ocean Docker container the name
"jenkins-tutorials".

This means you could access the Jenkins/Blue Ocean container (through a separate
terminal/command prompt window) with a `docker exec` command like:

`docker exec -it jenkins-tutorials bash`
