== Post-installation setup wizard

After downloading, installing and running Jenkins using one of the procedures
above, the post-installation setup wizard begins.

This setup wizard takes you through a few quick "one-off" steps to unlock
Jenkins, customize it with plugins and create the first administrator user
through which you can continue accessing Jenkins.


=== Unlocking Jenkins

When you first access a new Jenkins instance, you are asked to unlock it using
an automatically-generated password.

. Browse to `\http://localhost:8080` (or whichever port you configured for
  Jenkins when installing it) and wait until the *Unlock Jenkins* page appears.

. From the Jenkins console log output, copy the automatically-generated
  alphanumeric password (between the 2 sets of asterisks).

  *Note:* 
* The command: `sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword` will print the password at console. +
. On the *Unlock Jenkins* page, paste this password into the *Administrator
  password* field and click *Continue*. +
  *Notes:*
* If you ran Jenkins in Docker in detached mode, you can access the Jenkins
  console log from the Docker logs
  (<<accessing-the-jenkins-console-log-through-docker-logs,above>>).
* The Jenkins console log indicates the location (in the Jenkins home directory)
  where this password can also be obtained. This password must be entered in the
  setup wizard on new Jenkins installations before you can access Jenkins's main
  UI. This password also serves as the default admininstrator account's password
  (with username "admin") if you happen to skip the subsequent user-creation
  step in the setup wizard.


=== Customizing Jenkins with plugins

After <<unlocking-jenkins,unlocking Jenkins>>, the *Customize Jenkins* page
appears. Here you can install any number of useful plugins as part of your
initial setup.

Click one of the two options shown:

* *Install suggested plugins* - to install the recommended set of plugins, which
   are based on most common use cases.
* *Select plugins to install* - to choose which set of plugins to initially
   install. When you first access the plugin selection page, the suggested
   plugins are selected by default.

NOTE: If you are not sure what plugins you need, choose **Install suggested
plugins**.
You can install (or remove) additional Jenkins plugins at a later point in time
via the
link:../../book/managing[**Manage Jenkins**] >
link:../../book/managing/plugins/[**Manage Plugins**] page in Jenkins.

The setup wizard shows the progression of Jenkins being configured and your
chosen set of Jenkins plugins being installed. This process may take a few
minutes.


=== Creating the first administrator user

Finally, after <<customizing-jenkins-with-plugins,customizing Jenkins with
plugins>>, Jenkins asks you to create your first administrator user.

. When the *Create First Admin User* page appears, specify the details for your
  administrator user in the respective fields and click *Save and Finish*.
. When the *Jenkins is ready* page appears, click *Start using Jenkins*. +
  *Notes:*
* This page may indicate *Jenkins is almost ready!* instead and if so, click
  *Restart*.
* If the page does not automatically refresh after a minute, use your web
  browser to refresh the page manually.
. If required, log in to Jenkins with the credentials of the user you just
  created and you are ready to start using Jenkins!

IMPORTANT: From this point on, the Jenkins UI is only accessible by providing
valid username and password credentials.
