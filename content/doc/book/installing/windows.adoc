= Windows

The simplest way to install Jenkins on Windows is to use the Jenkins Windows installer.
That program will install Jenkins as a service using a 64 bit JVM chosen by the user.
Keep in mind that to run Jenkins as a service, the account that runs Jenkins must have permission to login as a service.

== Windows MSI installers

Refer to the Windows section of the
link:https://www.jenkins.io/download/#downloading-jenkins[Downloading Jenkins] page
to download either an LTS release or a weekly release of the Windows installer.
After the download completes, open the Windows installer and follow its instructions.

See the link:https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2020/08/12/windows-installers-upgrade/#next-steps[upgrade steps] when you upgrade to a new release.
