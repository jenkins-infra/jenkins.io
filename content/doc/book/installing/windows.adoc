= Windows

The simplest way to install Jenkins on Windows is to use the Jenkins Windows installer.
That program will install Jenkins as a service using a 64 bit JVM chosen by the user.
Keep in mind that to run Jenkins as a service, the account that runs Jenkins must have permission to login as a service.
