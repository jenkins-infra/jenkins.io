= Kubernetes

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling,
and management of containerized applications.

A Kubernetes cluster adds a new automation layer to Jenkins.
Kubernetes makes sure that resources are used effectively and that your servers
and underlying infrastructure are not overloaded.
Kubernetes' ability to orchestrate container deployment ensures that Jenkins always
has the right amount of resources available.
This section will describe different options to install/run Jenkins on Kubernetes.

Note: the documented approach with Minikube is a Quickstart guide only suited for development and testing purposes.
It should not be used for production instances.
Configure production instances based on the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/[Kubernetes guidelines].

==== Prerequisites

Docker::
Refer to the link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/[Docker Engine installation instructions] for your platform.

Kubernetes::
If you don't have a running Kubernetes cluster, see the <<Create a Kubernetes cluster with minikube>> section.

==== Create a minikube cluster

Minikube is a tool that creates a single-node Kubernetes cluster on your computer.
Follow these steps if you don't have a running Kubernetes cluster:

. Install minikube by following the steps from the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/[Install minikube] site.
. Install kubectl. See the instructions from the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[Install and Set Up kubectl] page.
. You can now create a minikube cluster by entering the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ minikube start
----
. Once the cluster has been created, you can verify its status by entering:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ minikube status
----

==== Create a namespace

A distinct namespace provides an additional layer of isolation and more control
over the continuous integration environment. Create a namespace for the Jenkins
deployment by typing the following command on your terminal:
[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl create namespace jenkins
----

Use the following command to list existing namespaces:
[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl get namespaces
----

The output confirms that the jenkins namespace was created successfully.

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl get namespaces
NAME              STATUS   AGE
default           Active   50m
jenkins           Active   30s
kube-node-lease   Active   50m
kube-public       Active   50m
kube-system       Active   50m
