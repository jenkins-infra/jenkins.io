Jenkins is typically run as a standalone application in its own process.
The Jenkins WAR file bundles link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/winstone[Winstone],
a link:https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/[Jetty] servlet container wrapper,
and can be started on any operating system or platform with a version of Java supported by Jenkins.
This is the preferred way to deploy Jenkins and is fully supported.

Theoretically, Jenkins can also be run as a servlet in a traditional servlet container
like link:https://tomcat.apache.org/[Apache Tomcat] or link:https://www.wildfly.org/[WildFly],
but in practice this is largely untested and there are many caveats.
In particular, support for WebSocket agents is only implemented for the Jetty servlet container.
See the link:/doc/book/platform-information/support-policy-servlet-containers[Servlet Container Support Policy] page for details.

WARNING: Support for traditional servlet containers may be discontinued in the future.

== Requirements
* **Jenkins 2.492.3+ requires Servlet API 5.0 (Jakarta EE 9)**
* Compatible containers:
  * **Tomcat 10.1.x** (Tested with 10.1.40 - latest version)
  * WildFly version needs verification (minimum 30+ recommended)
* Requires JDK 17+ for full compatibility

== Tomcat 10
### Deployment
[source,bash]
----
# Download Tomcat 10.1.x
wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-10/v10.1.40/bin/apache-tomcat-10.1.40.tar.gz

# Extract and deploy
tar xzf apache-tomcat-10.1.40.tar.gz
export CATALINA_HOME=$(pwd)/apache-tomcat-10.1.40
cp jenkins.war $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/
----

### Configuration
**Set Jenkins home:**
[source,bash]
----
mkdir /var/lib/jenkins
echo "export CATALINA_OPTS=-DJENKINS_HOME=/var/lib/jenkins" > $CATALINA_HOME/bin/setenv.sh
chmod +x $CATALINA_HOME/bin/setenv.sh
----

NOTE: Running multiple Jenkins controllers within a single Java process is unsupported.

Scheme selection in redirect URLs is delegated to the servlet container,
and Jetty handles the `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-By`, and `X-Forwarded-Proto` headers by default.
With Tomcat, one needs to add a link:https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-10.0-doc/config/valve.html#Remote_IP_Valve[Remote IP Valve]
to expose these headers to Jenkins via the Servlet API.
Add the following to `+${CATALINA_HOME}/conf/server.xml+` within the `<Host>` section:

[source,xml]
----
<Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteIpValve"
       remoteIpHeader="X-Forwarded-For"
       proxiesHeader="X-Forwarded-By"
       protocolHeader="X-Forwarded-Proto" />
----

== WildFly

### Requirements
* **WildFly 30+** required for Jenkins 2.492.3+ with JDK 17
* Uses Servlet API 5.0 (Jakarta EE 9) with `jakarta.servlet` namespace
* **Incompatible with WildFly 26 and earlier** (Servlet API 4.0)

### Deployment
[source,bash]
----
cp jenkins.war $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments/
----

### Configuration
[source,bash]
----
# Add this to $JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.conf
JAVA_OPTS="$JAVA_OPTS -DJENKINS_HOME=/var/lib/jenkins"
----

NOTE: Running multiple Jenkins controllers within a single Java process is unsupported.
