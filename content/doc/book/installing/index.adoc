= Installing Jenkins

The procedures on this page are for new installations of Jenkins on a
single/local machine.

Jenkins is typically run as a standalone application in its own process with the
built-in
link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7213541/what-is-java-servlet[Java
servlet] container/application server
(link:http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/[Jetty]).

Jenkins can also be run as a servlet in different Java servlet containers such
as link:http://tomcat.apache.org/[Apache Tomcat] or
link:https://javaee.github.io/glassfish/[GlassFish]. However, instructions for
setting up these types of installations are beyond the scope of this page.

*Note:* Although this page focuses on local installations of Jenkins, this
content can also be used to help set up Jenkins in production environments.


== Prerequisites

Minimum hardware requirements:

* 256 MB of RAM
* 1 GB of drive space (although 10 GB is a recommended minimum if running
  Jenkins as a <<docker,Docker>> container)

Recommended hardware configuration for a small team:

* 1 GB+ of RAM
* 50 GB+ of drive space

Software requirements:

* Java: see the link:/doc/administration/requirements/java[Java Requirements] page
* Web browser: see the link:/doc/administration/requirements/web-browsers[Web Browser Compatibility] page

== Installation platforms

This section describes how to install/run Jenkins on different platforms and
operating systems.


=== Docker

////
IMPORTANT: If you update content in this section, please ensure you check these
changes against the procedures documented in the sibling
'_run-jenkins-in-docker.adoc' file, which is used in the Tutorials of the
Jenkins User Documentation.
////

link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/docker-overview/[Docker] is a platform for
running applications in an isolated environment called a "container" (or Docker
container). Applications like Jenkins can be downloaded as read-only "images"
(or Docker images), each of which is run in Docker as a container. A Docker
container is in effect a "running instance" of a Docker image. From this
perspective, an image is stored permanently more or less (i.e. insofar as image
updates are published), whereas containers are stored temporarily. Read more
about these concepts in the Docker documentation's
link:https://docs.docker.com/get-started/[Getting Started, Part 1: Orientation
and setup] page.

Docker's fundamental platform and container design means that a single Docker
image (for any given application like Jenkins) can be run on any supported
operating system (macOS, Linux and Windows) or cloud service (AWS and Azure)
which is also running Docker.


==== Installing Docker

To install Docker on your operating system, visit the
link:https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community[Docker
store] website and click the *Docker Community Edition* box which is suitable
for your operating system or cloud service. Follow the installation instructions
on their website.

Jenkins can also run on Docker Enterprise Edition, which you can access through
*Docker EE* on the Docker store website.

[CAUTION]
====
If you are installing Docker on a Linux-based operating system, ensure
you configure Docker so it can be managed as a non-root user. Read more about
this in Docker's
link:https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/linux-postinstall/[Post-installation
steps for Linux] page of their documentation. This page also contains
information about how to configure Docker to start on boot.
====


==== Downloading and running Jenkins in Docker

There are several Docker images of Jenkins available.

The recommended Docker image to use is the link:https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jenkins/[`jenkins/jenkins` image] (from the link:https://hub.docker.com/[Docker Hub repository]). 
We recommend the current link:/download[Long-Term Support (LTS) release of Jenkins] for production environments, and keep weekly releases and long term support release candidates for testing.

[NOTE]
====
A new `jenkins/jenkins` image is published each time a new release of Jenkins is published. 
You can see a list of previously published versions of the `jenkins/jenkins` image on the link:https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jenkins/tags/[tags] page.

LTS versions can be identified as they are composed of 3 digits (eg. `2.138.4` or `2.164.1`), when weekly releases are composed of only 2 digits (eg. `2.158` or `2.166`).

=== WAR file

The Web application ARchive (WAR) file version of Jenkins can be installed on
any operating system or platform that supports Java.

*To download and run the WAR file version of Jenkins:*

. Download the
  link:http://mirrors.jenkins.io/war-stable/latest/jenkins.war[latest stable
  Jenkins WAR file] to an appropriate directory on your machine.
. Open up a terminal/command prompt window to the download directory.
. Run the command `java -jar jenkins.war`.
. Browse to `\http://localhost:8080` and wait until the *Unlock Jenkins* page
  appears.
. Continue on with the <<setup-wizard,Post-installation setup wizard>> below.

*Notes:*

* You can change the port by specifying the `--httpPort` option when you run the `java -jar jenkins.war` command. 
  For example, to make Jenkins accessible through port 9090, then run Jenkins using the command: `java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=9090`

=== macOS

To install from the website, using a package:

* link:http://mirrors.jenkins.io/osx/latest[Download the latest package]
* Open the package and follow the instructions

Jenkins can also be installed using `brew`:

* Install the latest release version
[source,bash]
----
brew install jenkins
----

* Install the LTS version
[source,bash]
----
brew install jenkins-lts
----


=== Linux


==== Debian/Ubuntu

On Debian-based distributions, such as Ubuntu, you can install Jenkins through `apt`.

Recent versions are available in link:https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/[an apt repository]. Older but stable LTS versions are in link:https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/[this apt repository].

[source,bash]
----
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins
----

This package installation will:

* Setup Jenkins as a daemon launched on start. See `/etc/init.d/jenkins` for more details.
* Create a '`jenkins`' user to run this service.
* Direct console log output to the file `/var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log`. Check this file if you are troubleshooting Jenkins.
* Populate `/etc/default/jenkins` with configuration parameters for the launch, e.g `JENKINS_HOME`
* Set Jenkins to listen on port 8080. Access this port with your browser to start configuration.

[NOTE]
====
If your `/etc/init.d/jenkins` file fails to start Jenkins, edit the `/etc/default/jenkins` to replace the line
`----HTTP_PORT=8080----` with `----HTTP_PORT=8081----`
Here, "8081" was chosen but you can put another port available.
====

==== Fedora

You can install Jenkins through `dnf`. You need to add the Jenkins repository from the Jenkins website to the package manager first.

[source,bash]
----
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/redhat/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://jenkins-ci.org/redhat/jenkins-ci.org.key
----

Then, you can install Jenkins.  The following command also ensures you have java installed.

[source,bash]
----
sudo dnf upgrade && sudo dnf install jenkins java
----

Next, start the Jenkins service.

[source,bash]
----
sudo service jenkins start
sudo chkconfig jenkins on
----

You can check the status of the Jenkins service using this systemctl command:

[source,bash]
----
systemctl status jenkins
----

If everything has been set up correctly, you should see an output like this:

[source,bash]
----
Loaded: loaded (/etc/rc.d/init.d/jenkins; generated)
Active: active (running) since Tue 2018-11-13 16:19:01 +03; 4min 57s ago
...
----

[NOTE]
====
If you have a firewall installed, you must add Jenkins as an exception. 
You must change `YOURPORT` in the script below to the port you want to use. Port `8080` is the most common.

[source,bash]
----
firewall-cmd --permanent --new-service=jenkins
firewall-cmd --permanent --service=jenkins --set-short="Jenkins Service Ports"
firewall-cmd --permanent --service=jenkins --set-description="Jenkins service firewalld port exceptions"
firewall-cmd --permanent --service=jenkins --add-port=YOURPORT/tcp
firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=jenkins
firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
----

====

=== Windows

To install from the website, using the installer:

* link:http://mirrors.jenkins.io/windows/latest[Download the latest package]
* Open the package and follow the instructions


=== Other operating systems


==== OpenIndiana Hipster

On a system running link:http://www.openindiana.org/[OpenIndiana Hipster]
Jenkins can be installed in either the local or global zone using the
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_Packaging_System[Image Packaging
System] (IPS).

[IMPORTANT]
====
Disclaimer: This platform is NOT officially supported by the Jenkins team,
use it at your own risk. Packaging and integration described in this section
is maintained by the OpenIndiana Hipster team, bundling the generic `jenkins.war`
to work in that operating environment.
====

For the common case of running the newest packaged weekly build as a standalone (Jetty) server, simply execute:

[source,bash]
----
pkg install jenkins
svcadm enable jenkins
----

The common packaging integration for a standalone service will:

* Create a `jenkins` user to run the service and to own the directory structures under `/var/lib/jenkins`.
* Pull the OpenJDK8 and other packages required to execute Jenkins, including
  the `jenkins-core-weekly` package with the latest `jenkins.war`.
+
CAUTION: Long-Term Support (LTS) Jenkins releases currently do not support OpenZFS-based
systems, so no packaging is provided at this time.
* Set up Jenkins as an SMF service instance (`svc:/network/http:jenkins`) which
  can then be enabled with the `svcadm` command demonstrated above.
* Set up Jenkins to listen on port 8080.
* Configure the log output to be managed by SMF at `/var/svc/log/network-http:jenkins.log`.

Once Jenkins is running, consult the log
(`/var/svc/log/network-http:jenkins.log`) to retrieve the generated
administrator password for the initial set up of Jenkins, usually it will be
found at `/var/lib/jenkins/home/secrets/initialAdminPassword`. Then navigate to
link:http://localhost:8080[localhost:8080] to <<setup-wizard, complete configuration of the
Jenkins instance>>.


To change attributes of the service, such as environment variables like `JENKINS_HOME`
or the port number used for the Jetty web server, use the `svccfg` utility:

[source,bash]
----
svccfg -s svc:/network/http:jenkins editprop
svcadm refresh svc:/network/http:jenkins
----

You can also refer to `/lib/svc/manifest/network/jenkins-standalone.xml` for more
details and comments about currently supported tunables of the SMF service.
Note that the `jenkins` user account created by the packaging is specially privileged
to allow binding to port numbers under 1024.

The current status of Jenkins-related packages available for the given release
of OpenIndiana can be queried with:

[source,bash]
----
pkg info -r '*jenkins*'
----

Upgrades to the package can be performed by updating the entire operating
environment with `pkg update`, or specifically for Jenkins core software with:

[source,bash]
----
pkg update jenkins-core-weekly
----

[CAUTION]
====
Procedure for updating the package will restart the currently running Jenkins
process. Make sure to prepare it for shutdown and finish all running jobs
before updating, if needed.
====


==== Solaris, OmniOS, SmartOS, and other siblings

Generally it should suffice to install Java 8 and link:/download[download] the
`jenkins.war` and run it as a standalone process or under an application server
such as link:http://tomcat.apache.org[Apache Tomcat].


Some caveats apply:

* Headless JVM and fonts: For OpenJDK builds on minimalized-footprint systems,
  there may be
  link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+got+java.awt.headless+problem[issues
  running the headless JVM], because Jenkins needs some fonts to render certain
  pages.
* ZFS-related JVM crashes: When Jenkins runs on a system detected as a `SunOS`,
  it tries to load integration for advanced ZFS features using the bundled
  `libzfs.jar` which maps calls from Java to native `libzfs.so` routines
  provided by the host OS. Unfortunately, that library was made for binary
  utilities built and bundled by the OS along with it at the same time, and was
  never intended as a stable interface exposed to consumers. As the forks of
  Solaris legacy, including ZFS and later the OpenZFS initiative evolved, many
  different binary function signatures were provided by different host
  operating systems - and when Jenkins `libzfs.jar` invoked the wrong
  signature, the whole JVM process crashed. A solution was proposed and
  integrated in `jenkins.war` since weekly release 2.55 (and not yet in any LTS
  to date) which enables the administrator to configure which function
  signatures should be used for each function known to have different variants,
  apply it to their application server initialization options and then run and
  update the generic `jenkins.war` without further workarounds. See
  link:https://github.com/kohsuke/libzfs4j[the libzfs4j Git repository] for
  more details, including a script to try and "lock-pick" the configuration
  needed for your particular distribution (in particular if your kernel updates
  bring a new incompatible `libzfs.so`).

Also note that forks of the OpenZFS initiative may provide ZFS on various
BSD, Linux, and macOS distributions. Once Jenkins supports detecting ZFS
capabilities, rather than relying on the `SunOS` check, the above caveats for
ZFS integration with Jenkins should be considered.
