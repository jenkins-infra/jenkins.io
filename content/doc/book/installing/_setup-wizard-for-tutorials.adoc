==== Setup wizard

Before you can access Jenkins, there are a few quick "one-off" steps you'll need
to perform.


===== Unlocking Jenkins

When you first access a new Jenkins instance, you are asked to unlock it using
an automatically-generated password.

. After the 2 sets of asterisks appear in the terminal/command prompt window,
  browse to `\http://localhost:8080` and wait until the *Unlock Jenkins* page
  appears.

page",width=100%]
. From your terminal/command prompt window again, copy the
  automatically-generated alphanumeric password (between the 2 sets of
  asterisks).

initial admin password",width=100%]
. On the *Unlock Jenkins* page, paste this password into the *Administrator
  password* field and click *Continue*.


===== Customizing Jenkins with plugins

After <<unlocking-jenkins,unlocking Jenkins>>, the *Customize Jenkins* page
appears.

On this page, click *Install suggested plugins*.

The setup wizard shows the progression of Jenkins being configured and the
suggested plugins being installed. This process may take a few minutes.


===== Creating the first administrator user

Finally, Jenkins asks you to create your first administrator user.

. When the *Create First Admin User* page appears, specify your details in the
  respective fields and click *Save and Finish*.
. When the *Jenkins is ready* page appears, click *Start using Jenkins*. +
  *Notes:*
* This page may indicate *Jenkins is almost ready!* instead and if so, click
  *Restart*.
* If the page doesn't automatically refresh after a minute, use your web browser
  to refresh the page manually.
. If required, log in to Jenkins with the credentials of the user you just
  created and you're ready to start using Jenkins!


==== Stopping and restarting Jenkins

Throughout the remainder of this tutorial, you can stop the Jenkins/Blue Ocean
Docker container by running `docker container stop jenkins jenkins-docker`.

To restart the Jenkins/Blue Ocean Docker container:

. Run the same `docker run ...` command you ran for <<on-macos-and-linux,macOS,
  Linux>> or <<on-windows,Windows>> above. +
  *Note:* This process also updates the `jenkinsci/blueocean` Docker image, if
  an updated one is available.
. Browse to `\http://localhost:8080`.
. Wait until the log in page appears and log in.
