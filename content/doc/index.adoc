Welcome to the Jenkins user documentation - for people wanting to _use_
Jenkins's existing functionality and plugin features.

If you want to _extend_ the functionality of Jenkins by developing your own
Jenkins plugins, please refer to the <<doc/developer#,Extend Jenkins>>
(developer documentation).


== What is Jenkins?

Jenkins is a self-contained, open source automation server which can be used to
automate all sorts of tasks related to building, testing, and delivering or
deploying software.

Jenkins can be installed through native system packages, Docker, or even run
standalone by any machine with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.


== About this documentation

This documentation begins with a
<<doc/pipeline/tour/getting-started#,Guided Tour>>
to help you get up and running with Jenkins and introduce you to Jenkins's main
feature, Pipeline.

There are also <<doc/tutorials#,tutorials>> geared to developers who want to
orchestrate and automate building their project in Jenkins using Pipeline and
Blue Ocean.

If you've never used Jenkins before or have limited Jenkins experience, then the
Guided Tour and introductory tutorials are good places to start.

If you are looking for more detailed information about using Jenkins, please
refer to the <<doc/book/getting-started#,User Handbook>>.


=== Documentation scope

Jenkins is a highly extensible product whose functionality can be extended
through the installation of plugins.

There are a vast array of plugins available to Jenkins. However, the
documentation covered in the <<doc/pipeline/tour/getting-started#,Guided Tour>>,
<<doc/tutorials#,Tutorials>>, <</solutions#,Solution pages>> and <<doc/book/getting-started#,User Handbook>> of
this documentation are based on a <<doc/book/installing#,Jenkins installation>>
with the <<doc/book/blueocean/getting-started#,Blue Ocean plugins installed>>,
as well as the "suggested plugins", which are specified when running through the
<<doc/book/installing#setup-wizard,Post-installation setup wizard>>.
