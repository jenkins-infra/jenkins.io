Hello i faced problem when i access agent docker in declarative pipeline in mac OS Monterey

I used this jenkinsfile from our repository https://github.com/ankushkatiyar/react-cypress/blob/main/Jenkinsfile and when i execute this in job then it will throw error 
"/Users/ankushktr/.jenkins/workspace/pipeline-demo-vscode@tmp/durable-84d2dca5/script.sh: line 1: docker: command not found"
I fixed this problem for adding path in location "/usr/local/Cellar/jenkins-lts/2.176.3/homebrew.mxcl.jenkins-lts.plist"
And i added this :

<key>EnvironmentVariables</key>
<dict>
<key>PATH</key>
<string>/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/bin/:/Users/Kh0a/Library/Group\Containers/group.com.docker/Applications/Docker.app/Contents/Resources/bin</string>
</dict>

Possible to add this propose changes in somewhere in jenkins documentation so whenever new user install jenkins in mac OS and execute agent docker then user can add path in above mentioned file

Thanks
