Welcome to the user documentation for Jenkins.

== What is Jenkins?

Jenkins is a self-contained, open source automation server which can be used to
automate all sorts of tasks such as building, testing, and deploying software.

Jenkins can be installed through native system packages, Docker, or even run
standalone by any machine with the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed.
