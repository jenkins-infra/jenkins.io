==== Artwork

image::/images/logo_128.png[title="Jenkins", float=right]

On our link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Logo[Logo] page we have
documented some versions of our logo, including the color palette our branding
uses. Our logos can be downloaded in a number of sizes, or as vector graphics,
from link:https://get.jenkins.io/art/[here]. Please do not use any of
our "fun logo" variations like Ninja or Superhero Jenkins in publications.

When embedding our logo in an article, we prefer the `logo.png` (see Figure 1)
to be used over the `headshot.png` image.

If you have any questions about artwork, please ask one of the <<Press Contacts>>.
