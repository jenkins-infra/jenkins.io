This document only defines the Code of Conduct and Reporting/Handling processes
for the Jenkins project/community. For more details about our cultural values,
goals, philosophies, structure and so on, please consult our
link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Governance+Document[Governance Document]. 


== Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of this project (defined under <<Community Spaces>>
and the
link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Governance+Document[Governance
Document]), and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community,
we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues,
posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or
patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender
identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance,
body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery
* Personal attacks
* Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing other's private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission
* Other unethical or unprofessional conduct

The Jenkins board has the right and responsibility to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful. Plugin and other maintainers also have the
right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code,
wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code
of Conduct.

By adopting this Code of Conduct, the Jenkins board commits themselves to
fairly and consistently applying these principles to every aspect of managing
this project. Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of
Conduct may be permanently removed from the project team.

This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the
link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Governance+Board[Jenkins
board] at jenkinsci-board@googlegroups.com.  All complaints will be reviewed
and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and
appropriate to the circumstances. The board is obligated to maintain
confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the
link:http://contributor-covenant.org/[Contributor Covenant], version 1.3.0,
available from link:http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/3/0/[contributor-covenant.org/version/1/3/0/].


=== Community Spaces

==== Source Control

* GitHub
** Organizations

*** link:https://github.com/jenkinsci-cert[jenkinsci-cert]
*** link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra[jenkins-infra]
** Commits
** Pull requests
** Issues
** Wikis
* Subversion

Technical criticism is always appreciated, but avoid destructive behavior such as unconstructive criticism: don't merely decry the current state of affairs; offer—or at least solicit—suggestions as to how things may be improved.

Everything hosted under link:https://jenkins-ci.org/[jenkins-ci.org] and its sub-domains such as:

==== IRC Channels

Documented in the
link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/IRC+Channel[IRC Channel] wiki
page, e.g.

* `#jenkins`
* `#jenkins-meeting`
* `#jenkins-infra`
* `#jenkins-community`

  link:https://fosdem.org[FOSDEM] , link:https://socallinuxexpo.org/[SCaLE])
* Other Jenkins groups (such as conferences, meetups, and other unofficial
  forums) are encouraged to adopt this Code of Conduct. Those groups must
  provide their own moderators and/or reporting system.


== Reporting

If you feel somebody has breached this code, please send an email with the
relevant information (links, etc) to jenkinsci-board@googlegroups.com. This
email list is only readable by the
link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Governance+Board[Governance
Board] members.

Please understand that the board may not have all of the necessary context and
history, so it's better to be more verbose than less verbose about such
matters.

If you believe one of the members of the board has violated the code of conduct
above, please email one of the other members of the Governance Board with the
details (their emails are visible on the
link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Governance+Board[Governance
Board] page).

== Handling of violations

Depending on the severity of the violations the board may elect to take one of the following paths. The resolution of violations will be done in private, and the affected people will be notified but there will not be a public announcement. We aim to prevent mud-slinging and unnecessary further personal attacks/etc.

=== Reprimand

If the severity of the violation is mild enough, the board will notify the
community member that his or her conduct is not acceptable and needs to change.

=== Probation

If the severity of the violation is serious or reprimands are not effective,
the board will ask the community member to "take a break." Meaning, to step
away from the project for a period of time. This means no participating in:

* The link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/IRC+Channel[IRC Channels]
* Mailing lists
* Pull requests
* Events
* etc

The intent of this is to send a clear signal to the community member that their
conduct is unacceptable, de-escalate the situation for everyone who are
affected, and ask the community member to reflect on their behaviors.

=== Expulsion

If probation clearly doesn't address the issue, or the issue is of high
severity to warrant an expulsion, the contributor will be expelled from the
Jenkins community for a period of 12 months. After which they may appeal to the
board for the ban to be lifted.

The ban will include but is not limited to:

*  Bans from Jenkins community IRC Channels
*  Deletion of their LDAP account
*  Blocking their GitHub username from the jenkinsci github organization
*  Banning their email address from jenkins mailing lists
