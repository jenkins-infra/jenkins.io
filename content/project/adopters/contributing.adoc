== Share your story

We encourage Jenkins users and adopters to share their success stories about Jenkins!
There are multiple ways to do it:

* Your organization's or your personal blog
* link:/blog[Jenkins community blog] on jenkins.io
  (link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc#adding-a-blog-post[HOWTO])
* link:https://jenkinsistheway.io/[JenkinsIsTheWay.io] website with Jenkins user stories
* Any other blog or professional network

Whatever way you choose, we encourage you to contact the link:/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/[Advocacy and Outreach SIG] and
let them know about your story so that it can be promoted through Jenkins community channels.
