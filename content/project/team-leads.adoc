title: "Jenkins Team Leads and Officers"
section: project
---

Jenkins team leads and officers are individual contributors with the responsibility and accountability for
leading a particular facet of the Jenkins project and/or the community.
These roles are held by community members who have proven themselves to be responsible and courteous,
representing the executive branch of the Jenkins project governance model.
Team leads and officers act with the authority in guiding and making decisions within the project, and representing the Jenkins project within the area of their responsibility.
Officer roles are an essential part of Jenkins' community governance and well-being.

The difference between _Jenkins Officers_ and _Team Leads_ lays in the appointment process:

* Team Leads are appointed by the link:/project/governance-meeting/[Jenkins Governance Meeting] after nomination in the Jenkins developer mailing list.
  The Jenkins team leads do not have a specific term, roles may be introduced and transferred as deemed necessary by the community.
* Jenkins Officer is an *elected role*.
  Officers are elected by the Jenkins community during the regular link:/project/board-election-process/[Jenkins elections].
  Jenkins Officers have a fixed term though the number of terms is not limited.

## Responsibilities

All Jenkins officers and team leads have the following responsibilities:

* Coordinating the work inside the teams and SIGs they lead.
  While team leads are responsible to ensure that the mission-critical community processes work, they are not expected to work on them single-handedly.
* Onboarding new contributors to the teams they lead.
* Mentorship and knowledge sharing within the team to ensure healthy officer rotation in the project,
  with opportunity for team leads to move on to other roles or to take a break when needed.
* Facilitating initiatives within the scope of the responsibility, maintaining the team's roadmap,
  and ensuring that key team initiatives reflected on the link:/project/roadmap/[public Jenkins roadmap].
* Representing the Jenkins project and community within the area of their responsibility.
