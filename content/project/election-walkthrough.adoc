This document outlines, how to nominate and vote for board members and officers, with the different services used during the election.
If you are interested in the election process, please read the link:../board-election-process[Board and Officer election process] and the link:../governance[governance] documents.

This document uses the elections of 2023 in the examples.
The process is the same for all future elections, except for the year.
The election process is driven by the Jenkins Governance board members who are not up for reelection (aka the _election committee_).
In 2023, the election committee consists of link:/blog/authors/notmyfault/[Alexander Brandes] and link:/blog/authors/uhafner/[Ullrich Hafner].

== Election phases

The election process consists of five phases with the following dates:

* Announcement (August 1)
* Nomination of candidates (August 1 - September 15)
* Voter registration (September 16 - October 31)
* Voting (November 1 - November 31)
* Results announcement (December 1)

See the next sections for details about each phase.
