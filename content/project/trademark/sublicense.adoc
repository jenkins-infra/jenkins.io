The Jenkins Sublicense Agreement

Version 2.0

THIS JENKINS SUBLICENSE AGREEMENT (the "Sublicense") is between Software
in the Public Interest, Inc., located in Indianapolis, Indiana (herein
"SPI"), and Sublicensee, as identified on the Application Approval
Statement (defined below) along with address and other contact
information. This Sublicense is effective as of the Issuance Date
specified on the Application Approval Statement (the "Effective Date").

RECITALS

WHEREAS, SPI has certain trademark rights to the Jenkins mark (the
"Trademark"), and SPI holds and exercises the exclusive right (a) to
sublicense the use of the Trademark and goodwill to individuals and
entities in order to protect the right of responsible persons to use the
Trademark in connection with Authorized Goods/Services (as defined
herein), and (b) to otherwise act for the benefit of the Jenkins
community with respect to the Trademark; and

WHEREAS, Sublicensee desires to acquire the right from SPI to use the
Trademark in connection with the Authorized Goods/Services identified in
Sublicensee's sublicense application, to the extent Sublicensee's use of
the Trademark is not considered "fair use." "Authorized Good/Services"
means Jenkins-based goods/services. Jenkins-based goods are computer
systems and software using, incorporating or derived from any version of
the Jenkins core as posted by the Jenkins project at jenkins-ci.org.
Jenkins-based services are services that deploy, document, facilitate
the use of, or enhance Jenkins-based goods. "Sublicensee Mark" is the
mark Sublicensee has requested permission to use in commerce, as
identified in Sublicensee's application approval statement sent to
Sublicensee by SPI (the "Application Approval Statement").

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein
contained, the adequacy and sufficiency of which is acknowledged, the
parties agree as follows:

TERMS OF SUBLICENSE

{empty}1. Sublicense Grant.

{empty}1.1 Grant. +
Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Sublicense, SPI hereby
grants to Sublicensee, and Sublicensee hereby accepts, a world-wide, non
exclusive, perpetual, non transferable sublicense to use the Sublicensee
Mark and goodwill, in the form on the Application Approval Statement
(such form, the "Authorized Use"), in connection with the Authorized
Goods/Services identified on the Application Approval Statement that are
produced (if Authorized Goods) or provided (if Authorized Services) by
or on behalf of Sublicensee.

{empty}1.2 Consideration. +
As due and adequate consideration for this Sublicense and for as long as
this Sublicense remains in effect, Sublicensee hereby agrees to adhere
to and abide by all the terms and conditions of this Sublicense
including, without limitation, Section 1.3 (Consent), Section 1.4 (Non
Exclusivity), Section 3.1 (Trademark Legend and Other Requirements), and
Section 3.2 (Protection of Trademark). Sublicensee shall pay all taxes
imposed as a result of the existence or operation of this Sublicense
except any income and franchise tax imposed on SPI by any governmental
entity.

{empty}1.3 No Consent. +
This Sublicense may not be used as evidence of SPI's consent to
registration of a trademark or other registered mark with any
registration authority in any jurisdiction. If any such application is
or has been filed by or on behalf of Sublicensee for the Sublicensee
Mark, and such registration authority finally denies such registration
as being confusingly similar to the Trademark (or the equivalent
doctrine in the relevant jurisdiction), then Sublicensee shall promptly,
but no later than 30 calendar days' following such denial, cease and
abandon all use of the Sublicensee Mark and any and all registration or
application for registration thereof, and this Sublicense shall
automatically terminate without need for any further action on the part
of SPI. This Sublicense is not a guaranty that registration will be
granted for use of the Sublicensee Mark (or any other mark incorporating
the Trademark) in any jurisdiction, and SPI shall not undertake or have
no obligation of any type or quality to assist Sublicensee obtain,
maintain or defend any such rights Sublicensee may have or attain.

{empty}1.4 Non Exclusivity. +
SPI does not make any representation that SPI will not grant another
sublicense to another sublicensee for use of the Trademark in a manner
that is the same or similar to the Sublicensee Mark, nor shall SPI have
any obligation to use or exercise any efforts, reasonable or otherwise,
to determine whether a sublicense has been granted that is the same or
similar to the Sublicensee Mark. Further, SPI shall have no obligation
to mediate, resolve, or otherwise involve themselves or become involved
in any dispute involving the Sublicensee Mark including, without
limitation, disputes involving potentially conflicting uses. Sublicensee
hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless SPI from any claims and
costs arising out of such disputes involving Sublicensee relating to
this Sublicense or the Sublicensee Mark, whether between Sublicensee and
any other sublicensee(s) or between Sublicensee and other person(s)
claiming rights in the Trademark or the Sublicensee Mark anywhere in the
world.

{empty}2. Term and Termination.

{empty}2.1 Duration. +
This Sublicense and the rights granted hereunder are perpetual and shall
remain in force from the Effective Date, subject to the termination
provisions herein.

{empty}2.2 Sublicensee Termination. +
Sublicensee may terminate this Sublicense for any reason upon no more
than 30 days' prior written notice, or such +
other time period as may be mutually agreed upon.

{empty}2.3 SPI Termination. +
SPI may, in addition to any other rights it may have, terminate this
Sublicense upon 30 days' prior written notice upon a breach by
Sublicensee of any material term hereof; provided, however, that if the
breach is capable of cure, Sublicensee shall have 21 days from the date
of notice to cure the breach; provided further, however, that such cure
period shall not apply in the sole and exclusive discretion of SPI if
Sublicensee has previously breached and then cured, following notice by
SPI, the same material term.

{empty}2.4 Automatic Termination. +
This Sublicense shall terminate automatically upon the occurrence of any
of the following unless otherwise agreed in advance in writing by SPI:
(a) Sublicensee makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors, or if
any proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency law is commenced by or
against the Sublicensee; (b) the sale, transfer, or encumbrance of any
rights granted hereunder, or the making of any levy, seizure, or
attachment thereof or thereon without the consent of the SPI; (c) an
acquisition, merger, or other transaction that results in a change of
control of the Sublicensee; (d) Sublicensee ceases using the Sublicensee
Mark in commerce; or (e) pursuant to Section 1.3. Sublicensee agrees to
use reasonable efforts to notify SPI promptly, via its website, of any
cessation of +
use by Sublicensee of the Sublicensee Mark.

{empty}2.5 Obligations Upon Termination. +
Immediately upon termination of this Sublicense for any reason,
Sublicensee shall cease and discontinue completely and permanently use
of the Sublicensee Mark in commerce, except as may be permitted under
the doctrine of fair use or its equivalent in any particular
jurisdiction. The following provisions shall survive termination of this
Sublicense for any reason: this Section 2.5 (Obligations Upon
Termination); Section 4 (Limited Warranty; Disclaimers of Warranties and
Liabilities); and Section 5 (Miscellaneous).

{empty}3. Additional Sublicensee Rights and Obligations.

{empty}3.1 Trademark Legend and Other Requirements. +
Sublicensee is required to place the following legend conspicuously on
all Authorized Goods/Services, and at least once in the area of the
title page of any documentation or sales literature accompanying the
Authorized Goods/Services:

"The registered trademark Jenkins(R) is used pursuant to a sublicense from
SPI, owner of the mark on a world-wide basis."

Recognizing that there may be space limitations, any reasonable
facsimile of this language may be used as a substitute where made
necessary by such space limitations. In case of doubt as to the proper
shortened form, exemplars should be submitted to SPI. The first
reference to the Trademark standing alone (not including the Sublicensee
Mark) in the documentation and advertising of the product shall also
bear the circle (R) symbol by the word mark Jenkins. SPI shall have a
reasonable right to request copies of and to inspect products and
advertising distributed by Sublicensee as an aid to enforcing its
Trademark and its rights hereunder, as a part of policing the Trademark.
Sublicensee shall not make any statements in its advertisements, manuals
or literature that imply that its use of the Sublicensee Mark or
Trademark, or a modified version of the Sublicensee Mark or the
Trademark, is any type of certification or standard authorized by SPI.

{empty}3.2 Protection of Trademark. +
Sublicensee agrees not to challenge, oppose, petition to cancel or
otherwise attack or limit the Trademark (whether its validity,
enforceability, scope of coverage, or otherwise) or SPI's exclusive
ownership thereof anywhere in the world.

{empty}3.3 Authorized Uses. +
Sublicensee agrees that SPI is not responsible or makes any
representation about rules, regulations, laws or other restrictions or
conditions of using the Sublicensee Mark in any jurisdiction.
Sublicensee shall have no recourse whatsoever against SPI if Sublicensee
cannot use the Trademark or the Sublicensee Mark in connection with the
Authorized Use in any given territory(ies) for any reason.

{empty}4.LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES AND LIABILITIES

{empty}4.1 SPI warrants that it owns the right to sublicense the Trademark in
the United States and anywhere else that SPI owns the Trademark. SPI
MAKES NO OTHER WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE (E.G., THAT ANY AUTHORIZED GOODS/ SERVICES TO
WHICH THE SUBLICENSEE MARK IS APPLIED ARE COMPLIANT WITH ANY STANDARDS)
AND ANY WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO NON-INRINGEMENT OF THE TRADEMARK, THE
SUBLICENSEE MARK, OR OF THE AUTHORIZED GOODS/SERVICES BEARING THE
TRADEMARK AND/OR SUBLICENSEE MARK.

{empty}4.2 EXCEPT FOR ANY BREACH OF THE LIMITED WARRANTY ABOVE, SPI EXPRESSLY
DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES INCURRED BY SUBLICENSEE AND THIRD
PARTY CLAIMS OF ANY KIND THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF SUBLICENSEE'S USE OF THE
TRADEMARK AND/OR THE SUBLICENSEE MARK.

{empty}4.3 Without these limitations on warranties and disclaimers, and without
other limitations on SPI's obligations set forth elsewhere in this
Sublicense (including, without limitation, those identified in Section
{empty}1.3 (Consent) and Section 1.4 (Non Exclusivity)), SPI would not grant
the Sublicense at any royalty rate or under any circumstances. These
disclaimers of liability and warranties shall be effective as to any
country in which Sublicensee (or another for or on behalf of
Sublicensee) manufactures, sells, licenses or performs Authorized
Goods/Services using the Sublicensee Mark.

{empty}5. Miscellaneous.

{empty}5.1 No Sublicensee Rights. +
Sublicense shall not have any rights against SPI.

{empty}5.2 Assignment. +
SPI may assign or transfer its rights under this Sublicense to a
subsidiary, affiliate or parent of SPI. Sublicensee may not assign or
transfer this Sublicense (whether by agreement or operation of law)
without the prior written consent of SPI, which consent may be given or
denied in its sole discretion. This Sublicense shall in all cases be
binding on the parties' successors and assigns.

{empty}5.3 Notices. +
All notices provided for in this Sublicense shall be in writing and
shall be effective when actually received by the addressees at the
addresses listed in the Application Approval Statement. Either party may
change its address to which notices or requests shall be directed by
written notice to the other party (which may be via email at the last
known email address), but until such change of address has been received
any notice or request sent to the addresses listed below shall be
effective upon mailing or sending (if by email) and shall be considered
as having been received.

{empty}5.4 Severability. +
If any term or provision of this Sublicense shall be held invalid under
any applicable law, rule or regulation of any jurisdiction, then that
provision notwithstanding, this Sublicense shall remain in full force

include not only damages, interest, and expenses incurred but also
reasonable attorney fees and the full costs of defending any such +
claims.
