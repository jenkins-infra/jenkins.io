  Jenkins integrates well with the Ruby toolchain for common tasks that many
  Ruby developers are already running locally. Tasks such as executing
  [RSpec](http://rspec.info/) or [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/), generating
  documentation, running code analysis tools and deploying Ruby software can
  all be done through Jenkins.


  ### Integrating test results

  Many tools, like Cucumber, can natively output JUnit-formatted XML which
  integrates by default into Jenkins via the "Publish JUnit test result report"
  Post-build Action. For tools which do not generate the appropriately
  formatted XML by default, there are gems which add the necessary formatters,
  such as [ci_reporter](https://github.com/ci-reporter/ci_reporter).

  By integrating the test reports into Jenkins, you can generate trends and
  reports. There are other plugins, such as the [Email
  Ext plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Email-ext+plugin) which can
  also make use of these machine-readable test reports to send email
  notifications with only the failing test cases listed.

  Using plugins such as the [Cucumber Test Result
  plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Cucumber+Test+Result+Plugin)
  improve the integration and discoverability of successful/unsuccessful
  Cucumber scenarios.

  By integrating these tools into Jenkins, team members no longer need to
  attempt to parse thousands of lines of console output, but instead can more
  easily find the important information about a build.
