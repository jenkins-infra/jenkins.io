Unlike compiled languages, Python doesn't need a "build" per se. Python
projects can still benefit greatly from using Jenkins for continuous
integration and delivery.

In the Python ecosystem there are tools which can be integrated into Jenkins
for testing/reporting such as:

* link:https://github.com/nose-devs/nose2[nose2] for executing unit tests and
  generating JUnit-compatible XML test reports _and_
  link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Cobertura+Plugin[Cobertura]-compatible
  code coverage reports.

* link:http://www.pylint.org/[pylint] for generating code quality reports which
  can be integrated directly into Jenkins for trending and reporting purposes.
