As one of the predominant mobile platforms, Android is attractive to a number
of developers, but it does bring it's own set of challenges with it. With an

however, it is possible to build and test on a myriad of emulated devices.

When combined with the

pipeline, sending builds to an alpha channel in Google Play for release or
further testing.
