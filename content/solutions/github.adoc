title: "Jenkins with GitHub"
---

Jenkins, itself link:https://github.com/jenkinsci[located on GitHub], has a
number of plugins for integrating into link:https://github.com[GitHub]. The two
primary avenues for integrating your Jenkins instance with GitHub are with
"build integration," using GitHub to trigger builds, or with "authentication
integration," using GitHub as the source of authentication information to
secure a Jenkins instance.

== Build integration

With the help of the link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Git+Plugin[Git plugin]
Jenkins can easily pull source code from any Git repository that the Jenkins
build node can access.

The link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/GitHub+Plugin[GitHub
plugin] extends
upon that integration further by providing improved bi-directional
integration with GitHub. Allowing you to set up a link:https://developer.github.com/webhooks/#service-hooks[Service
Hook] which will hit
your Jenkins instance every time a change is pushed to GitHub.

Going the other direction, the GitHub plugin can also feed information back
into GitHub via the link:https://github.com/blog/1227-commit-status-api[commit status
API], more details

== Authenticating with GitHub

Using the
link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/GitHub+OAuth+Plugin[GitHub
Authentication plugin] it is possible to use GitHub's own authentication scheme
for implementing authentication in your Jenkins instance.

The **link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Github+OAuth+Plugin#GithubOAuthPlugin-Setup[setup guide]**
will help walk you through configuring the GitHub OAuth side, and your
Jenkins instance, to provide easy authentication/authorization for users.
