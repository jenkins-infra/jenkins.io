title: "Pipeline as Code with Jenkins"
---

The default interaction model with Jenkins, historically, has been very web UI
driven, requiring users to manually create jobs, then manually fill in the
details through a web browser. This requires additional effort to create and
manage jobs to test and build multiple projects, it also keeps the
configuration of a job to build/test/deploy separate from the actual code being
built/tested/deployed. This prevents users from applying their existing CI/CD
best practices to the job configurations themselves.


== Pipeline

With the introduction of the link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Plugin[Pipeline
plugin],
users now can implement a project's entire build/test/deploy pipeline
in a `Jenkinsfile` and store that alongside their code, treating their
pipeline as another piece of code checked into source control.

The Pipeline plugin was inspired by the
link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Build+Flow+Plugin[Build Flow
plugin] but aims to improve upon some concepts explored by Build Flow with
features like:

* the ability to suspend/resume of executing jobs.
* checking the pipeline definition into source control (`Jenkinsfile`)
* support for extending the domain specific language with additional,
  organization specific steps, via the
  "link:https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/jenkins-workflow-using-global-library-implement-re-usable-function-call-secured-http-endpoint[global
  library]" feature

In an adjacent space is the
link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Job+DSL+Plugin[Job DSL plugin]
which is worth mentioning as well.
