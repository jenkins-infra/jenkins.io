Most web applications are changed and adapted quite frequently and quickly.
Their environment, for example the size and the behaviour of the user base, are
constantly changing. What was sufficient yesterday can be insufficient today.
Especially in a web environment it is important to monitor and continuously
improve the internal quality not only when developing, but also when
maintaining the software.

Many of the plugins referenced (right) can be used to integrate with PHP
projects, but may first need to be configured the create appropriately
formatted files when working with PHP projects.


== Configuring PHP Tools

The configurations below assume the use of link:https://ant.apache.org[Apache
Ant] as the build tool for executing PHP tools. Originally described on
link:https://jenkins-php.org/automation.html[jenkins-php.org].

=== PHPUnit

The `phpunit` task in the `build.xml` assumes that an XML configuration file
for PHPUnit is used to configure the following logging targets:

[source,xml]
----
<logging>
 <log type="coverage-html" target="build/coverage"/>
 <log type="coverage-clover" target="build/logs/clover.xml"/>
 <log type="coverage-crap4j" target="build/logs/crap4j.xml"/>
 <log type="junit" target="build/logs/junit.xml" logIncompleteSkipped="false"/>
</logging>
----

You can download a sample `phpunit.xml.dist` and place it in your project root to get started.

More information can be found in the documentation for PHPUnit.

=== phpDox

The `phpdox` task in the `build.xml` assumes that an XML
configuration file for phpDox is used to configure the API documentation
generation:


[source,xml]
----
<phpdox xmlns="http://xml.phpdox.net/config">
 <project name="name-of-project" source="src" workdir="build/phpdox">
  <collector publiconly="false">
   <include mask="*.php" />
  </collector>

  <generator output="build">
   <build engine="html" enabled="true" output="api">
    <file extension="html" />
   </build>
  </generator>
 </project>
</phpdox>
----

More information can be found in the documentation for phpDox.

=== PHP_CodeSniffer

The `phpcs` and `phpcs-ci` tasks in the `build.xml` assume that an
XML configuration file for PHP_CodeSniffer is used to configure the coding
standard:

[source,xml]
----
<ruleset name="name-of-your-coding-standard">
 <description>Description of your coding standard</description>

 <rule ref="Generic.PHP.DisallowShortOpenTag"/>
 <!-- ... -->
</ruleset>
----

The build script assumes that the rule sets for PHP_CodeSniffer is located at
`build/phpcs.xml`.

More information can be found in the documentation for PHP_CodeSniffer.

=== PHPMD

The `phpmd` and `phpmd-ci` tasks in the `build.xml` assume that an XML
configuration file for PHPMD is used to configure the coding standard:

[source,xml]
----
<ruleset name="name-of-your-coding-standard"
  xmlns="https://pmd.sf.net/ruleset/1.0.0"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="https://pmd.sf.net/ruleset/1.0.0
                      https://pmd.sf.net/ruleset_xml_schema.xsd"
  xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="https://pmd.sf.net/ruleset_xml_schema.xsd">
  <description>Description of your coding standard</description>

  <rule ref="rulesets/codesize.xml/CyclomaticComplexity" />
  <!-- ... -->
</ruleset>
----

The build script assumes that the rule sets for PHPMD is located at
`build/phpmd.xml`.

More information can be found in the documentation for PHPMD.
