title: "Jenkins and PHP"

Most web applications are changed and adapted quite frequently and quickly.
Their environment, for example the size and the behaviour of the user base, are
constantly changing. What was sufficient yesterday can be insufficient today.
Especially in a web environment it is important to monitor and continuously
improve the internal quality not only when developing, but also when
maintaining the software.

This guide provides a basic configuration for testing and reporting for PHP
projects with Jenkins.

In addition to running and reporting tests, you'll get reports on test run
times, test coverage (including visualizations), and static analysis checks,
including trend graphs, and new and fixed issues compared to the master /
reference branch.

Use the *pipeline step reference* link on the plugin pages for full
documentation and options for Jenkinsfile.


== Configuring PHP Tools

This guide uses Jenkinsfile based pipelines and assumes you already have a
basic Jenkinsfile.

This guide assumes that you already have each of the tools mentioned
configured for use outside of Jenkins. Only the necessary configuration
options for working with Jenkins are mentioned.

This guide uses the `build/` directory for storing generated logs and reports.

It's assumed that all tools configuration files are in the repository root and
PHP code is in the `src` subdirectory.

=== PHPUnit Test & Coverage Reports

The following configuration will set up 3 reports for PHPUnit tests:

* Pass/fail monitoring via the plugin:xunit[xUnit plugin]
* Coverage stats via the plugin:code-coverage-api[Code Coverage API plugin] (using the cobertura adaptor)
* HTML coverage report via the plugin:htmlpublisher[HTML Publisher plugin]

In the PHPUnit config file (`phpunit.xml` or `phpunit.xml.dist`):

[source,xml]
----
<phpunit>
    <coverage>
        <include>
            <directory suffix=".php">src</directory>
        </include>
        <report>
            <html outputDirectory="build/coverage" />
            <cobertura outputFile="build/logs/cobertura.xml"/>
        </report>
    </coverage>
    <logging>
        <junit outputFile="build/logs/junit.xml" />
    </logging>
</phpunit>
----

In the Jenkinsfile:

[source,groovy]
----
stage('Unit Tests') {
    steps {
        sh 'vendor/bin/phpunit'
        xunit([
            thresholds: [
                failed ( failureThreshold: "0" ),
                skipped ( unstableThreshold: "0" )
            ],
            tools: [
                PHPUnit(pattern: 'build/logs/junit.xml', stopProcessingIfError: true, failIfNotNew: true)
            ]
        ])
        publishHTML([
            allowMissing: false,
            alwaysLinkToLastBuild: false,
            keepAll: false,
            reportDir: 'build/coverage',
            reportFiles: 'index.html',
            reportName: 'Coverage Report (HTML)',
            reportTitles: ''
        ])
        publishCoverage adapters: [coberturaAdapter('build/logs/cobertura.xml')]
    }
}
----

=== PHPStan and CodeSniffer Static Analysis Reports

In this example, PHPCS is shown running with 2 different configurations (mainly
to show this can be done).

Reports are processed using the CheckStyle format report and the
plugin:warnings-ng[Warnings Next Generation plugin]

This is done because PHPCompatibility checks are run across the `vendor/`
directory to aid in monitoring potential problems for version updates.

This example setup shows running the static analysis tools in parallel, which
may result in faster build times.

In Jenkinsfile:
[source,groovy]
----
stages {
    stage('Static Analysis') {
        parallel {
          stage('CodeSniffer') {
              steps {
                  sh 'vendor/bin/phpcs --standard=phpcs.xml .'
              }
          }
          stage('PHP Compatibility Checks') {
              steps {
                  sh 'vendor/bin/phpcs --standard=phpcs-compatibility.xml .'
              }
          }
          stage('PHPStan') {
              steps {
                  sh 'vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --error-format=checkstyle --no-progress -n . > build/logs/phpstan.checkstyle.xml'
              }
          }
        }
    }
    post {
        always {
            recordIssues([
                sourceCodeEncoding: 'UTF-8',
                enabledForFailure: true,
                aggregatingResults: true,
                blameDisabled: true,
                referenceJobName: "repo-name/master",
                tools: [
                    phpCodeSniffer(id: 'phpcs', name: 'CodeSniffer', pattern: 'build/logs/phpcs.checkstyle.xml', reportEncoding: 'UTF-8'),
                    phpStan(id: 'phpstan', name: 'PHPStan', pattern: 'build/logs/phpstan.checkstyle.xml', reportEncoding: 'UTF-8'),
                    phpCodeSniffer(id: 'phpcompat', name: 'PHP Compatibility', pattern: 'build/logs/phpcs-compat.checkstyle.xml', reportEncoding: 'UTF-8')
                ]
            ])
        }
    }
}
----

You'll want to change the `repo-name` in the `referenceJobName` directive to
match your repository. This tells Jenkins which job to compare the results
against for branches and PR jobs.

Set the report location in CodeSniffers configuration file (`phpcs.xml`):
[source,xml]
----
<ruleset name="Default">
    <arg name="report-checkstyle" value="build/logs/phpcs.checkstyle.xml" />
</ruleset>
----

==== Ignoring tool run failures / tuning failure conditions
If you want the build to pass regardless of the results of tools (ie. ignore
the exit code), you can append `|| exit 0` to the end of the `sh` command.

Alternatively, for CodeSniffer you can add the following into the configuration
file (`phpcs.xml`):
[source,xml]
----
<ruleset name="default">
    <config name="ignore_errors_on_exit" value="1" />
    <config name="ignore_warnings_on_exit" value="1" />
</ruleset>
----

You can then fine-tune the failure conditions using the
link:/doc/pipeline/steps/warnings-ng/[Warnings-NG pipeline configuration]

==== Results Caching

You can improve build times (for each run after the first) using caching
features available in both CodeSniffer and PHPStan.

In CodeSniffers configuration file (`phpcs.xml`):
[source,xml]
----
<ruleset name="default">
    <arg name="cache" value="build/cache/codesniffer.phpcs" />
</ruleset>
----

If you have multiple CodeSniffer configurations as in the example Jenkinsfile
above, be sure to set different cache paths.

In PHPStan's configuration file (`phpstan.neon`):
[source]
----
parameters:
    tmpDir: build/cache/phpstan
----
