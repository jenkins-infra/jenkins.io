## Releases

Currently releases are mirrored to the locations documented on the link:https://get.jenkins.io/index.html?mirrorstats[mirror status page].

### Running a mirror

More mirrors are certainly welcome.
Jenkins is mirrored by the link:https://osuosl.org/services/hosting/details[Oregon State University Open Source Lab (OSUOSL)] and by servers hosted by donors in the United States, Europe, China, Singapore, and Japan.
Worldwide mirrors reduce the load on individual servers, spread the bandwidth costs among multiple servers, and improve download performance for users.

If you're interested in running a public mirror, open an issue in link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk[] and we can discuss space and bandwidth requirements.
Mirrors on the Indian subcontinent, in South America, Russia and in Africa would be great additions to the Jenkins mirrors.
