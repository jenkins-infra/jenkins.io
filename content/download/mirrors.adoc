Jenkins packages and plugins are served by the web service https://get.jenkins.io (or its legacy alias mirrors.jenkins.io).

The web service https://get.jenkins.io relies on a network of mirror servers provided by generous sponsors of the Jenkins project all over the world.
When a user download a plugin or a file, the web service https://get.jenkins.io redirects (transparently) the user to the closest mirror.
The web service https://get.jenkins.io is based on the Open Source mirror redirector https://github.com/etix/mirrorbits.

The list of mirrors (and their locations) is available on the following page: link:https://get.jenkins.io/index.html?mirrorstats[mirror status page].

## How to Help the Jenkins Project by Running a Mirror?

Download mirror servers are always welcome to reduce the load on individual servers, to spread the bandwidth costs among multiple servers and to provide locations close to users.

If you provide (or want to provide) a download mirror server, you'll have to fulfill the requirements below.
We provide the link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk[GitHub "jenkins-infra" helpdesk] were you can open issues to add/change/delete a mirror or if you have any problem.


Mirror requirements:

* An HTTP server to serve files for the end users with:
** A public IPv4 and IPv6 (we recommend both). You can have multiple IPs (see below).
** A valid and resolvable public domain name pointing to your public IPs (we recommend `A` and `AAAA` DNS records). Multi-valued DNS records are valid if you have many IPs.
** Enforced HTTPS with a valid TLS certificate

* A storage of at least 300Gb to to store ~1 year of files served by the HTTP server:
** As a data point, the "reference" download server, which is https://archives.jenkins.io, uses around ~600Gb with **all** of the files.
** 300Gb of data is enough to provide artifacts published for 1 year (recommended time window). You may clean artifacts older than 1 year (provided by the archives.jenkins.io).

* A rsync or FTP server to allow https://get.jenkins.io to scan your mirror regularly:
** Should serve the same data as the HTTP server
** You can restrict inbound requests using IPs: we provide an API endpoint at https://reports.jenkins.io/infrastructure/v2/index.json with our rsync/ftp outbound scanning IPs.
*** Check the JSON list at `"get.jenkins.io".outbound_ips[]`
*** Our scanning IPs do not change often (once a year usually) but we update the JSON daily in case of any change

* A rsync routine to keep your data up to date:
** The data source is rsync://archives.jenkins.io without authentication but we need your outbound IPs to restrict access.
** We recommend a (differential) data update at least hourly
** The file can be deleted if they are more than 1 year old to avoid filling your disks, unless you have at least 600 Gb of data available

* A contact email if we need to reach out to the mirror's administrators for advertising configuration change or errors reported by users.
** If you wish for us to keep this email privately, please send it to jenkins-infra-team@googlegroups.com

* The outbound IP(s) used by your rsync server to update data (so we can apply restrictions)
** We store these IPs in https://github.com/jenkins-infra/infra-reports/blob/main/jenkins-infra-data/get-jenkins-io-data.json
** You can open a Pull Request on this file to add/change your outbound IPs (even if your mirror is not up to date yet)
** Alternatively you can email them to us at jenkins-infra-team@googlegroups.com or share with us an API endpoint where we can retrieve the IPs regularly
