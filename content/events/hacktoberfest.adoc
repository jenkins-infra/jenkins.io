link:https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/[Hacktoberfest]
is a month long celebration of open source software.
It happens every year in October.
During this event everyone can support open-source by contributing changes, and then earn a limited edition swag.

We invite everyone to participate and to contribute to the Jenkins project,
regardless of their background and Jenkins experience.
There are many ways to
link:/participate/[contribute] to Jenkins during Hacktoberfest.
You can work on code or documentation,
contribute to link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Internationalization[localization],
create new link:/artwork[artwork], etc.
You can also share your experiences with Jenkins by link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc#adding-a-blog-post[creating a new blogpost].
Generally, any pull requests in GitHub would qualify.
See the link:/participate/[Contribute and Participate] page for more information about how to contribute.

== Quick start

1. Sign-up to Hacktoberfest on link:https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com[the event website].
2. Join link:https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/hacktoberfest[our Gitter channel].
3. Everything is set, just start creating pull-requests!
** If a repository has no `hacktoberfest` topic set,
   please mention Hacktoberfest in your pull requests so we can set repository topics
   (see link:/events/hacktoberfest/faq/#how-do-i-mark-my-pull-requests[FAQ: Marking Pull requests]).

== Where to contribute?

NOTE: **Hacktoberfest 2020 update:** On Oct 03, the Hacktoberfest organizers link:https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/hacktoberfest-update[made an update] to reduce spam and to introduce maintainer opt-in.
We follow the same policy in the Jenkins community,
and we do **NOT** require all maintainers to participate in Hacktoberfest.

The Jenkins project is spread across several organizations on GitHub (`jenkinsci`, `jenkins-infra`, `jenkins-zh`).
You are welcome to contribute to **any** repository in **any** of those organizations, or any other Jenkins-related repository on GitHub.
Repositories may have different contribution guidelines, review and merge policies.
If you adopt Jenkins in your open-source projects (e.g. Jenkins Pipeline or Configuration as Code),
it counts as well!
Note that not all pull requests will automatically count towards Hacktoberfest in 2020. 

* link:https://github.com/search?q=org%3Ajenkinsci+org%3Ajenkins-infra+org%3Ajenkins-zh+org%3Astapler+topic%3Ahacktoberfest[List of repositories marked for Hacktoberfest] -
  you can just submit pull requests, no extra steps needed.
* for other repositories, we will need to get the repo marked for Hacktoberfest so that your pull request counts towards the goal.
  Please follow link:/events/hacktoberfest/faq/#how-do-i-mark-my-pull-requests[FAQ: Marking Pull requests].

| Terminology cleanup
| Java, Web UI, Asciidoc, Markdown, Java
a| In 2016, the Jenkins community started changing the potentially offensive terminology within the project.
  The "slave" term was deprecated and replaced by "agent".
  In July 2020 we also link:https://cd.foundation/blog/2020/08/25/jenkins-terminology-changes/[adopted] the "controller" term instead of "master", and deprecated the "whitelist/blacklist" terms.
  There are many places where the old terminology still needs to be replaced.

We invite contributors to join us and participate in cleaning up Jenkins documentation,
Web and CLI interfaces, and the codebase:

  * jira:JENKINS-42816[] - Agent terminology cleanup - open issues and contributor guidelines
  * Guidelines in the issue above can be also used for other terms


| link:/artwork[Jenkins Artwork]
| Design
| Create new images and logos for link:/projects/jam/[Jenkins area meetups],
  link:/projects/[subprojects], and plugins.
  You can also contribute new graphics to plugins.

| link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/helm-charts[Jenkins Helm Chart]
| Kubernetes, Helm, Documentation
a| `stable/jenkins` helm chart was recently been moved to link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/helm-charts[jenkinsci/helm-charts].
  The goal is to release a 3.0.0 version of the chart, which removes old or deprecated configuration options, simplifies the Chart and makes it easier to use.
  Here are some ideas:

  * Remove offensive terms
  * Use WebSockets to connect agents
  * Improve it's documentation
  * Use link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool[Plugin Installation Manager Tool] to download plugins
  * Remove helm.sh/chart labels or introduce an option to remove them to have fewer changes when using GitOps

| Markdown, +
  Asciidoc
a| We are moving plugin documentation from https://wiki.jenkins.io/ to GitHub,
  and it is a great opportunity to create small pull requests that benefit all Jenkins users.

  * Migrate plugin documentation as documented in these link:/blog/2019/10/21/plugin-docs-on-github/[guidelines]).
  Plugins to convert can be found in the link:https://jenkins-wiki-exporter.jenkins.io/progress[Jenkins Wiki Exporter].
  * Move or improve existing documentation based on link:https://github.com/search?q=org%3Ajenkinsci+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adocumentation[GitHub issues]
  * Review and renew the existing plugin documentation.  For example, cleanup the agent terminology usage as suggested in the jira:JENKINS-42816[] EPIC
