link:https://hacktoberfest.com/[Hacktoberfest] is a month-long celebration of open source software that happens every October.
During this event, everyone can support open source by contributing changes and earning a unique digital reward.
This year marks the 11th anniversary of Hacktoberfest!

We invite everyone to participate and contribute to the Jenkins project, regardless of their background and Jenkins experience.
There are many ways to link:/participate/[contribute] to Jenkins during Hacktoberfest.
You can participate by working on link:https:/participate/code/[code] or link:/participate/document/[documentation], contributing to link:/doc/developer/internationalization/[localization], or creating new link:/artwork[artwork].
You can also share your experiences with Jenkins by link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc#adding-a-blog-post[creating a new blogpost].
Generally, any four non-spammy pull requests in GitHub would qualify.
Please refer to the link:/participate/[Contribute and Participate] page for more information about how to contribute.

== Quick start

1. Sign-up to Hacktoberfest on the link:https://hacktoberfest.com[event website].
2. Join our link:https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#jenkinsci_hacktoberfest:gitter.im[Gitter channel].
3. Everything is set, just start creating pull requests on repositories with the link:https://github.com/search?q=org%3Ajenkinsci+org%3Ajenkins-infra+topic%3Ahacktoberfest&type=repositories[`hacktoberfest` topic]!
** If a repository has no `hacktoberfest` topic set, contact the maintainers to see if they are willing to accept a contribution.
** Alternatively, if a pull request has the label `hacktoberfest-accepted`, it will count towards your total.
** Your pull request must not be labeled as invalid to be counted.
** For your pull requests to be accepted, the request must either be merged or have the `hacktoberfest-accepted` label.

== Where to contribute?

The Jenkins project is spread across two organizations on GitHub: link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/[`jenkinsci`] and link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/[`jenkins-infra`].
You are welcome to contribute to *any* repository with the link:[`hacktoberfest topic`] in *either* of those organizations.
Be aware that repositories may have different contribution guidelines, review processes, and merge policies.
Not all pull requests will automatically count towards Hacktoberfest.
Keep in mind, the pull request must either be merged in a repository with the `hacktoberfest` topic or have the `hacktoberfest-accepted` label.

* link:https://github.com/search?q=org%3Ajenkinsci+org%3Ajenkins-infra+topic%3Ahacktoberfest&type=repositories[Repositories marked for Hacktoberfest] - In these repositories you can just submit pull requests, no extra steps are needed.

=== Issue queries

We have marked some issues in Jenkins Jira and GitHub issues which can be handled by contributors during Hacktoberfest:

* link:https://issues.jenkins.io/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=19342[Newbie-friendly issues in Jenkins Jira]
* link:https://github.com/search?q=org%3Ajenkinsci+org%3Ajenkins-infra+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22[Good first issues on GitHub]
* link:https://github.com/search?q=org%3Ajenkinsci+org%3Ajenkins-infra+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahacktoberfest[GitHub issues suggested for Hacktoberfest]

=== Featured projects

If you are a new contributor, we have prepared a list of projects/components where you will get a warm welcome.
All these projects have tasks ready for new contributors, contributing guidelines, and active maintainers
who have committed to assist contributors and to provide quick turnaround in pull requests.

| link:http://plugins.jenkins.io/[Jenkins Plugin Site]
| Javascript, Java, React, Gatsby
a| The plugin site is used to find information about 2000+ plugins available in Jenkins.
   It provides plugin documentation, changelogs, open issues, and other data needed for Jenkins admins and end users.
   We are interested to keep improving the plugin site's UI/UX,
   provide more search options, and to provide deeper integration with GitHub and other services.
   Creating a dark mode was also mentioned a couple of times.

| Create new images and logos for link:/projects/jam/[Jenkins area meetups],
  link:/projects/[subprojects], and plugins.
  You can also contribute new graphics to plugins.

a| An infrastructure is constantly moving forward: there are always dependencies to update,
security issues to fix, new feature to release, tools to improve, etc.

Any kind of contribution is welcome: from documentation to real life code.
Either you are a beginner in this area, or a veteran of system administration,
you are welcome to pick an issue and contribute!

| link:/doc/developer/security/csp/[Content Security Policy (CSP)]
| JavaScript, Jelly, Security
a| During the last years, the Jenkins Security team has seen a lot of link:https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/[Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)] vulnerabilities, inside Jenkins core and also for a lot of plugins.
They have put in place different kinds of mechanisms to enhance the protection of some of the common dangerous code locations.
But this kind of approach does not scale enough to cover the wide ecosystem and the numerous different ways of introducing (accidentally) XSS vulnerabilities.

The objective of this topic is to ease the introduction of link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP[Content Security Policy (CSP)] in Jenkins by un-inlining the JavaScript resources.

* Skill requirement: a bit of JavaScript. The Jelly part is straightforward. No need to have security background.
* Time requirement: between 30 minutes and 4 hours.

More details on the approach in link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hr_Kaf0fVWBACibpHbSYsk4RoqcHD3cBrqXxuTtWKVM[this document].

| French translation
| Git, French, Jenkins developer tools
a| Improve coverage of French localization of the Jenkins web interface, including the Jenkins core and plugins.
The same is possible for other languages, let us know if you are interested!

  * Some proposals are listed in a link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-66660[dedicated Epic].
  * Use and improve the link:/doc/book/using/using-local-language/[language selection documentation]
  * Use and improve the link:/doc/developer/internationalization/[internationalization documentation]
