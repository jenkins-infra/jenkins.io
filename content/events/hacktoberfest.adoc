is a month long celebration of open source software.
It happens every year in October.
During this event everyone can support open-source by contributing changes, and then earn a limited edition swag.

We invite everyone to participate and to contribute to the Jenkins project,
regardless of their background and Jenkins experience.
There are many ways to
link:/participate/[contribute] to Jenkins during Hacktoberfest.
You can work on code or documentation,
contribute to link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Internationalization[localization],
create new link:/artwork[artwork], etc.
You can also share your experiences with Jenkins by link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc#adding-a-blog-post[creating a new blogpost].
Generally, any pull requests in GitHub would qualify.
See the link:/participate/[Contribute and Participate] page for more information about how to contribute.

== Quick start

1. Sign-up to Hacktoberfest on link:https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com[the event website].
2. Join link:https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/hacktoberfest[our Gitter channel].
3. Everything is set, just start creating pull-requests!
** This year Hacktoberfest does not require labeling pull requests,
   but please mention Hacktoberfest in your pull requests so that they are reviewed quickly
   (see link:/events/hacktoberfest/faq/#how-do-i-mark-my-pull-requests[FAQ: Marking Pull requests])

== Where to contribute?

The Jenkins project is spread across several organizations on GitHub (`jenkinsci`, `jenkins-infra`, `jenkins-zh`).
You are welcome to contribute to **any** repository in **any** of those organizations, or to any other Jenkins-related repository on GitHub.
However various components in Jenkins have differing review and delivery velocity.
If you adopt Jenkins in your own open-source projects (e.g. Jenkins Pipeline or Configuration as Code),
it counts as well!

=== Issue queries
