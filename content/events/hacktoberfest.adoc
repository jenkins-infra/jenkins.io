link:https://hacktoberfest.com/[Hacktoberfest]
is a month-long celebration of open source software.
It happens every year in October.
During this event everyone can support open-source by contributing changes, and then earn a unique digital reward.
This year marks the 10th anniversary of Hacktoberfest.

We invite everyone to participate and to contribute to the Jenkins project, regardless of their background and Jenkins experience.
There are many ways to link:/participate/[contribute] to Jenkins during Hacktoberfest.
You can work on code or documentation, contribute to link:/doc/developer/internationalization/, or create new link:/artwork[artwork], etc.
You can also share your experiences with Jenkins by link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc#adding-a-blog-post[creating a new blogpost].
Generally, any four non-spammy pull requests in GitHub or merge requests in GitLab would qualify.
Please see the link:/participate/[Contribute and Participate] page for more information about how to contribute.

== Quick start

1. Sign-up to Hacktoberfest on link:https://hacktoberfest.com[the event website].
2. Join link:https://matrix.to/#/#jenkinsci_hacktoberfest:gitter.im[our Gitter channel].
3. Everything is set, just start creating pull or merge requests!
** If a repository has no `hacktoberfest` topic is set, contact the maintainers to see if they are willing to accept a contribution.
** Alternatively, if a pull or merge request has the label `hacktoberfest-accepted`, it will count towards your total.
** Your pull or merge request must not be labeled as invalid to be counted.
** For your pull or merge requests to be accepted, your pull or merge requests must be merged, or have the `hacktoberfest-accepted` label, or have an overall approving review on GitHub.

== Where to contribute?

The Jenkins project is spread across several organizations on GitHub (`link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/[jenkinsci]` and `link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/[jenkins-infra]`.).
You are welcome to contribute to **any** repository in **any** of those organizations, or any other Jenkins-related repository on GitHub.
Repositories may have different contribution guidelines, review and merge policies.
If you adopt Jenkins in your open-source projects (e.g. Jenkins Pipeline or Configuration as Code), it counts as well!
Note that not all pull requests will automatically count towards Hacktoberfest.

* link:https://github.com/search?q=org%3Ajenkinsci+org%3Ajenkins-infra+topic%3Ahacktoberfest&type=repositories[List of repositories marked for Hacktoberfest] - you can just submit pull requests, no extra steps needed.
* For other repositories, we will need to get the repo marked with the topic "Hacktoberfest" for your pull request to count towards the goal.
  Please follow link:/events/hacktoberfest/faq/#how-do-i-mark-my-pull-requests[FAQ: Marking Pull requests].

a| The plugin site is used to find information about 1800+ plugins available in Jenkins.
   It provides plugin documentation, changelogs, open issues, and other data needed for Jenkins admins and end users.
   We are interested to keep improving the plugin site's UI/UX,
   provide more search options, and to provide deeper integration with GitHub and other services.

| French translation
| Git, French, Jenkins developer tools
a| Improve coverage of French localization of the Jenkins web interface, including the Jenkins core and plugins.
The same is possible for other languages, let us know if you are interested!

  * Some proposal are listed in link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-66658[a dedicated Epic].
  * A topic is opened in the link:https://community.jenkins.io/t/topic-traduction-fr-pour-hacktoberfest-2021-sentez-vous-libre-de-me-rejoindre/405[French category of discourse].
  * Use and improve if needed link:/doc/book/using/using-local-language/[the language selection documentation]
  * Use and improve if needed link:/doc/developer/internationalization/[the internationalization documentation]
  * If you want to participate to other language than French you are welcome ! However it would be great if you can find some other person speaking the target language for reviews.
  * Add terms for controller/agent/.. (and previous naming) in a speaking language you are mastering in tables https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/16/README.adoc#translations

a| An infrastructure is constantly moving forward: there are always dependencies to update,
security issues to fix, new feature to release, tools to improve, etc.

Any kind of contribution is welcome: from documentation to real life code.
Either you are a beginner in this area, or a veteran of system administration,
you are welcome to pick an issue and contribute!

* You might want to read the Jenkins Infrastructure's link:/projects/infrastructure/#contributing[Contributing Guide]
* Ready for action? Look at the good first issues we have on the infrastructure help desk at link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22[good first issues]

| Content Security Policy (CSP)
| JavaScript, Jelly, Security
a| During the last years, the Jenkins Security team has seen a lot of link:https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/[Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)] vulnerabilities, inside Jenkins core and also for a lot of plugins. 
They have put in place different kinds of mechanisms to enhance the protection of some of the common dangerous code locations. 
But this kind of approach does not scale enough to cover the wide ecosystem and the numerous different ways of introducing (accidentally) XSS vulnerabilities.

The objective of this topic is to ease the introduction of link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP[CSP] in Jenkins by un-inlining the JavaScript resources.

* Skill requirement: a bit of JavaScript. The Jelly part is straightforward. No need to have security background.
* Time requirement: between 30 minutes and 4 hours.

More details on the approach in link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hr_Kaf0fVWBACibpHbSYsk4RoqcHD3cBrqXxuTtWKVM[this document].
