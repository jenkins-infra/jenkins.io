link:https://hacktoberfest.com/[Hacktoberfest]
is a month long celebration of open source software.
It happens every year in October.
During this event everyone can support open-source by contributing changes, and then earn a limited edition swag.

We invite everyone to participate and to contribute to the Jenkins project,
regardless of their background and Jenkins experience.
There are many ways to
link:/participate/[contribute] to Jenkins during Hacktoberfest.
You can work on code or documentation,
contribute to link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Internationalization[localization],
create new link:/artwork[artwork], etc.
You can also share your experiences with Jenkins by link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc#adding-a-blog-post[creating a new blogpost].
Generally, any pull requests in GitHub would qualify.
See the link:/participate/[Contribute and Participate] page for more information about how to contribute.


== Quick start

1. Sign-up to Hacktoberfest on link:https://hacktoberfest.com[the event website].
2. Join link:https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#jenkinsci_hacktoberfest:gitter.im[our Gitter channel].
3. Everything is set, just start creating pull-requests!
** If a repository has no `hacktoberfest` topic set, contact the maintainers to see if they are willing to accecpt a contribution.


== Where to contribute?

The Jenkins project is spread across several organizations on GitHub (`link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/[jenkinsci]`, `link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/[jenkins-infra]`, `link:https://github.com/jenkins-zh/[jenkins-zh]`).
You are welcome to contribute to **any** repository in **any** of those organizations, or any other Jenkins-related repository on GitHub.
Repositories may have different contribution guidelines, review and merge policies.
If you adopt Jenkins in your open-source projects (e.g. Jenkins Pipeline or Configuration as Code),
it counts as well!
Note that not all pull requests will automatically count towards Hacktoberfest.

* link:https://github.com/search?q=org%3Ajenkinsci+org%3Ajenkins-infra+org%3Ajenkins-zh+topic%3Ahacktoberfest[List of repositories marked for Hacktoberfest] -
  you can just submit pull requests, no extra steps needed.
* for other repositories, we will need to get the repo marked for Hacktoberfest so that your pull request counts towards the goal.
  Please follow link:/events/hacktoberfest/faq/#how-do-i-mark-my-pull-requests[FAQ: Marking Pull requests].

| link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/helm-charts[Jenkins Helm Chart]
| Kubernetes, Helm, Documentation
a| `stable/jenkins` helm chart was recently been moved to link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/helm-charts[jenkinsci/helm-charts].
  The goal is to release a 3.0.0 version of the chart, which removes old or deprecated configuration options, simplifies the Chart and makes it easier to use.
  Here are some ideas:

  * Remove offensive terms
  * Use WebSockets to connect agents
  * Improve it's documentation
  * Use link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool[Plugin Installation Manager Tool] to download plugins
  * Remove helm.sh/chart labels or introduce an option to remove them to have fewer changes when using GitOps

| Markdown, +
  Asciidoc
a| We are moving plugin documentation from Jenkins Wiki to GitHub,
  and it is a great opportunity to create small pull requests that benefit all Jenkins users.

  * Migrate plugin documentation as documented in these link:/blog/2019/10/21/plugin-docs-on-github/[guidelines]).
  Plugins to convert can be found in the link:https://reports.jenkins.io/jenkins-plugin-migration.html[plugin migration progress report].
  * Move or improve existing documentation based on link:https://github.com/search?q=org%3Ajenkinsci+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adocumentation[GitHub issues]
  * Review and renew the existing plugin documentation.  For example, cleanup the agent terminology usage as suggested in the jira:JENKINS-42816[] EPIC

link:https://issues.jenkins.io/issues/?jql=labels%20in%20(docs-sig%2C%20documentation)%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20newbie-friendly%20AND%20status%20in%20(Open%2C%20%22In%20Progress%22%2C%20Reopened)[Jira newcomer-friendly issues],

| French translation
| Git, French, Jenkins developer tools
a| Improve coverage of French localization of the Jenkins web interface, including the Jenkins core and plugins.
The same is possible for other languages, let us know if you are interested!

  * Some proposal are listed in link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-66658[a dedicated Epic].
  * A topic is opened in the link:https://community.jenkins.io/t/topic-traduction-fr-pour-hacktoberfest-2021-sentez-vous-libre-de-me-rejoindre/405[French category of discourse].
  * Use and improve if needed link:/doc/book/using/using-local-language/[the language selection documentation]
  * Use and improve if needed link:/doc/developer/internationalization/[the internationalization documentation]
  * If you want to participate to other language than French you are welcome ! However it would be great if you can find some other person speaking the target language for reviews.
  * Add terms for controller/agent/.. (and previous naming) in a speaking language you are mastering in tables https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/16/README.adoc#translations

| link:/projects/infrastructure/#pick-up-a-task[Jenkins Infrastructure]
| Asciidoctor, Docker, Github Actions, Jenkins Pipeline, Kubernetes, Markdown, Packer, Puppet, Python, Shell, YAML
a| An infrastructure is constantly moving forward: there are always dependencies to update,
security issues to fix, new feature to release, tools to improve, etc.

Any kind of contribution is welcome: from documentation to real life code.
Either you are a beginner in this area, or a veteran of system administration,
you are welcome to pick an issue and contribute!

* You might want to read the Jenkins Infrastructure's link:/projects/infrastructure/#contributing[Contributing Guide]
* Ready for action? Look at the good first issues we have on the infrastructure help desk at link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22[good first issues]
* You can also browse the link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra[`https://github.com/jenkins-infra`] GitHub organization and check for repositories and code.

| Content Security Policy (CSP)
| JavaScript, Jelly, Security
a| During the last years, the Jenkins Security team has seen a lot of link:https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/[Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)] vulnerabilities, inside Jenkins core and also for a lot of plugins. 
They have put in place different kinds of mechanisms to enhance the protection of some of the common dangerous code locations. 
But this kind of approach does not scale enough to cover the wide ecosystem and the numerous different ways of introducing (accidentally) XSS vulnerabilities.

The objective of this topic is to ease the introduction of link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP[CSP] in Jenkins by un-inlining the JavaScript resources.

* Skill requirement: a bit of JavaScript. The Jelly part is straightforward. No need to have security background.
* Time requirement: between 30 minutes and 4 hours.

More details on the approach in link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hr_Kaf0fVWBACibpHbSYsk4RoqcHD3cBrqXxuTtWKVM[this document].
