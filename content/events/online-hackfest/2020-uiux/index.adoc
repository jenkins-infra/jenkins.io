UI/UX Online Hackfest is an online event, it will take place on May 25-29.
The goal to improve the Jenkins user experience, including but not limited to user interface and documentation.
We also invite participants to share experiences about Jenkins and to participate in UX testing.
The event will have the link:/blog/2020/04/30/jenkins-is-the-way/[Jenkins is the Way] theme.
The most active contributors will get special edition swag and other prizes, see below!

== What is Hackfest?

This hackfest is NOT a _hackathon_.
We do not expect participants to dedicate all their time during the event timeframe.
Instead of that, we organize it as a hop-in/hop-off event where everybody can spend as much time as they are willing to dedicate.
Spending a few days or a few hours is fine, any contributions matter regardless of their size.
Jenkins experience is not required, we have newcomer-friendly stories.
See the link:/participate/[Contribute and Participate] page for more information about how to contribute.

During this hackfest, we will organize link:https://www.meetup.com/Jenkins-online-meetup/[online meetups] and ad-hoc training sessions in different timezones.
There are no mandatory events you must attend remotely, all sessions will be recorded and published on link:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN7ajX_VdyaNll_Aw3M-NIQ042BV5teP9[our YouTube channel].
At the end of the event we will be inviting participants to join our demo sessions or to record and upload these demos to share asynchronously.

=== How to choose a project?

Check out the list of ideas below.
Try to find a project or an area interesting to you.
If you do not have a strong preference,
we recommend finding something that could improve your own experience and address the UX issues you hit with Jenkins personally.
If you do not use Jenkins personally but want to explore it,
consider working on newcomer-friendly issues or documentation for newcomer users:
getting started guides, tutorials, etc.

=== User Interface

This track focuses on projects related to the Jenkins web interface.
It includes not only the UI improvements and bug fixes,
but also the related user documentation and UX testing.
This track is coordinated by the link:/sigs/ux/[Jenkins User Experience] special interest group.

[frame="topbot",grid="all",options="header",cols="30%,70%"]
|=========================================================
|Project idea and Keywords | Description and links

| Look & Feel updates (link:/sigs/ux/#project-ui-look-and-feel[project page])
a| We want to modernize the Jenkins Web interface styling and appearance.
  It includes updating and restyling the commonly used layouts like main page, job pages,
  build console outputs, etc.

* Jira EPIC with tasks: jira:JENKINS-60919[]
* Other related newcomer-friendly issues: link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/issues/?jql=labels%20in%20(ui%2C%20ux%2C%20ux-sig%2C%20frontend%2C%20user-experience)%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20newbie-friendly%20AND%20status%20in%20(Open%2C%20%22In%20Progress%22%2C%20Reopened)[Jira query]
  
| Web UI Accessibility (link:/sigs/ux/#project-ui-accessibility[project page])
a| We would like to make Jenkins usable by as many people as possible.
  It includes multiple groups of users: people with disabilities, ones using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.
  In general, all Jenkins users would benefit from better navigation and layouts.

* Contribute to jira:JENKINS-62437[Change Jenkins configuration UI from tables to divs] and improve visualization on mobile devices.
** Due to the potentially breaking changes, crowd testing is needed!
** Submit patches to plugins which use table configuration layouts.
** link:/doc/developer/views/table-to-div-migration/[HOWTO: Migrating layouts from tables to divs].
* Work on minor accessibility issues listed in jira:JENKINS-62268[].

| jep:224[System Read permission]
a| A read-only view of Jenkins configurations, jobs and agents is important to plugin:configuration-as-code[Jenkins Configuration-as-Code] users.
  Soon we will release a new feature which extends support for read-only views
  (link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/pull/3279[announcement draft]).
  It is a great time to do crowd testing and to improve support for the feature in plugins.

* Try out the new feature for plugins, report the testing results, discovered issues and limitations.
* Add support for read-only mode to plugins (link:/doc/developer/views/read-only/[guidelines]).
* Some stories: jira:JENKINS-12548[] EPIC and a link:https://github.com/orgs/jenkinsci/projects/4[GitHub project] with more issues for grabs.

| UI Themes
a| Jenkins UI themes are widely used in Jenkins instances, and they contribute to better user experience.
  We invite users to improve the existing themes and to create new ones.
  link:/doc/book/managing/ui-themes/[UI Themes Documentation].

* Create a new Dark theme for Jenkins (jira:JENKINS-61480[])
* Blue Ocean Theme - apply Blue Ocean styling to the Jenkins UI
* Improve existing themes and adapt them to recent Jenkins versions (e.g. link:https://github.com/TobiX/jenkins-neo2-theme[Neo2 theme])
* Document managing themes in the plugin:/simple-theme-plugin[Simple Theme Plugin] documentation.
  We will have a demo for it on Wednesday.
* Create a new microsite on github.io or jenkins.io with themes listing (aka "theme marketplace").

| Pipeline Visualization and embedded docs
a| We would like to improve the built-in Pipeline visualization in Jenkins.
   This is an **advanced** topic requiring some expertise in Jenkins development.
   Some ideas raised by contributors:

* Embeddable Pipeline Browser (maybe based on the Blue Ocean code)
* Add support for providing Pipeline examples within Jenkins
* jira:JENKINS-56377[]: Improve performance of large Pipeline console outputs

| Credentials Management UX
a| plugin:credentials[Credentials Plugin] User interface is often reported as overly complicated.
   It would be great to improve it and make it easier to use.

** Improve navigation within the credentials management panels
** Add "Calls for action" for common operations so that users could easily access common actions
** Remove the _Manage credentials_ button from the main page, move it to _Manage Jenkins_

| Developer tools for Jenkins Web UI
a| Development tools could help developers to create better user interfaces in Jenkins.
   There are some areas that could be addressed:

* Add new UI samples for plugin developers in the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/ui-samples-plugin[UI Samples Plugin]
* Improve link:https://github.com/stapler/idea-stapler-plugin[IntelliJ IDEA plugin for Stapler] to simplify development of Web UI with the Stapler framework (link:https://github.com/stapler/idea-stapler-plugin/issues[open issues])
* **Advanced:** Create new link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/archetypes[archetypes] for JavaScript-based plugins

|=========================================================

=== User Documentation

We have several projects which are specifically related to user documentation.
It includes user and administrator guides, and also tutorials and installation guidelines
which are referenced from link:/doc/book/[this page].
This track is coordinated by the link:/sigs/docs/[Documentation] special interest group.

link:/participate/document/[Contributing to user documentation].

[frame="topbot",grid="all",options="header", cols="30%,70%"]
|=========================================================
|Project idea and Keywords | Description and links

| Improve User and Administrator Documentation
  (link:/sigs/docs/#user-guide[project page])
a| Let's improve the documentation for Jenkins end users and administrators.
   Located link:/doc/[on the Jenkins website], it follows the Documentation-as-Code approach.
  We would like to extend this documentation and to also make it more accessible and discoverable.

* Review and renew the user documentation.
* Help to migrate docs from Jenkins Wiki to jenkins.io (link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Adocumentation+label%3Awiki-migration[open issues]).
* Improve navigation: better menus and ToC, search support, etc.
* Improve documentation look&feel: CSS styles, rendering, etc.
* Test and improve documentation browsing on mobile devices

| Installation guidelines
a| If you are interested to do UX testing, Jenkins installation guidelines could be a great subject for you.
   Some guidelines were created long ago, and they could benefit from a refresh.

* Test link:/doc/book/installing/[installation guidelines] and link:/doc/tutorials/[tutorials],
  submit patches and discovered issues.
* Renew the Windows installation guide for Jenkins weekly releases that use the new Windows installer.
  See link:/blog/2019/02/01/windows-installers/[this blogpost] for an overview of the new Windows Installer.
* **Advanced:** Rewrite the link:/doc/book/installing/#docker[Docker installation guide] to use the `jenkins/jenkins` image instead of the Blue Ocean images.

| Document Jenkins use-cases
  (link:/sigs/docs/#solution-pages[project page])
a| Help us to improve documentation for real-world Jenkins use-cases!

* Review and refresh the existing link:/solutions/[solution pages]: add links to plugins and articles, extend the overview sections, improve the rendering. 
  See jira:WEBSITE-742[] for the issue links.
* **Advanced:** Create new link:/solutions/[solution pages] for various use-cases (e.g. Documentation as code, Continuous Deployment, Static Analysis) or technologies (Git, Gitlab, Kubernetes, etc.).
* **Advanced:** Create new link:/doc/tutorials/[Tutorials], e.g. how to use a Jenkins feature or how to implement a common automation use-case with Jenkins

| Improve Plugin Documentation
a| We are moving plugin documentation from Jenkins Wiki to Documentation as Code so that it is stored directly in plugin repositories.
   There are hundreds of plugins that need to be migrated.
   We invite contributors to help with migrating plugin pages and improving existing ones.
   link:/sigs/docs/#plugin-documentation-on-github[More info].

* Migrate plugin documentation as documented in these link:/blog/2019/10/21/plugin-docs-on-github/[guidelines]).
  List of plugins for grabs can be found in the link:https://jenkins-wiki-exporter.jenkins.io/progress[Jenkins Wiki Exporter].
