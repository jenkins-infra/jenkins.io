UI/UX Online Hackfest is an online event, it will take place on May 25-29.
The goal to improve the Jenkins user experience, including but not limited to user interface and documentation.
We also invite participants to share experiences about Jenkins and to participate in UX testing.
The event will have the link:/blog/2020/04/30/jenkins-is-the-way/[Jenkins is the Way] theme.

== What is Hackfest?

This hackfest is NOT a _hackathon_.
We do not expect participants to dedicate all their time during the event timeframe.
Instead of that, we organize it as a hop-in/hop-off event where everybody can spend as much time as they are willing to dedicate.
Spending a few days or a few hours is fine, any contributions matter regardless of their size.
Jenkins experience is not required, we have newcomer-friendly stories.
See the link:/participate/[Contribute and Participate] page for more information about how to contribute.

During this hackfest, we will organize link:https://www.meetup.com/Jenkins-online-meetup/[online meetups] and ad-hoc training sessions in different timezones.
There are no mandatory events you must attend remotely, all sessions will be recorded and published on link:https://www.youtube.com/user/jenkinsci/playlists[our YouTube channel].
At the end of the event we will be inviting participants to join our demo sessions or to record and upload these demos to share asynchronously.

=== How to choose a project?

Check out the list of ideas below.
Try to find a project or an area interesting to you.
If you do not have a strong preference,
we recommend finding something that could improve your own experience and address the UX issues you hit with Jenkins personally.
If you do not use Jenkins personally but want to explore it,
consider working on newcomer-friendly issues or documentation for newcomer users:
getting started guides, tutorials, etc.

=== How to report contributions?

We deployed a special link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/ui-ux-hackfest-2020[GitHub repository] which will be used to collect contributions and to generate reports from the event.
Please report your code and non-code contributions as GitHub issues, there are issues templates for common types of contributions.

|=========================================================
|Project idea and Keywords | Description and links

| Look & Feel updates (link:/sigs/ux/#project-ui-look-and-feel[project page])
a| We want to modernize the Jenkins Web interface styling and appearance.
  It includes updating and restyling the commonly used layouts like main page, job pages,
  build console outputs, etc.

* Jira EPIC with tasks: jira:JENKINS-60919[]
* Other related newcomer-friendly issues: link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/issues/?jql=labels%20in%20(ui%2C%20ux%2C%20ux-sig%2C%20frontend%2C%20user-experience)%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20newbie-friendly%20AND%20status%20in%20(Open%2C%20%22In%20Progress%22%2C%20Reopened)[Jira query]
  
| Web UI Accessibility (link:/sigs/ux/#project-ui-accessibility[project page])
a| We would like to make Jenkins usable by as many people as possible.
  It includes multiple groups of users: people with disabilities, ones using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.
  In general, all Jenkins users would benefit from better navigation and layouts.

* Contribute to the jira:JENKINS-56109[Change Jenkins configuration UI from tables to divs] story
   which will greatly improve visualization on mobile devices.
   Due to the potentially breaking changes, crowd testing and fixing of the plugins needed.
* Work on minor accessibility issues listed in jira:JENKINS-62268[]

| jep:224[System Read permission]
a| A read-only view of Jenkins configurations, jobs and agents is important to plugin:configuration-as-code[Jenkins Configuration-as-Code] users.
  Soon we will release a new feature which extends support for read-only views
  (link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/pull/3279[announcement draft]).
  It is a great time to do crowd testing and to improve support for the feature in plugins.

* Try out the new feature for plugins, report the testing results, discovered issues and limitations.
* Add support for read-only mode to plugins (link:/doc/developer/views/read-only/[guidelines]).
* Some stories: jira:JENKINS-12548[] EPIC and a link:https://github.com/orgs/jenkinsci/projects/4[GitHub project] with more issues for grabs.

| UI Themes
a| Jenkins UI themes are widely used in Jenkins instances, and they contribute to better user experience.
  We invite users to improve the existing themes and to create new ones.
  link:/doc/book/managing/ui-themes/[UI Themes Documentation].

* Create a new Dark theme for Jenkins (jira:JENKINS-61480[])
* Improve existing themes and adapt them to recent Jenkins versions (e.g. link:https://github.com/TobiX/jenkins-neo2-theme[Neo2 theme])
* Document managing themes in the plugin:/simple-theme-plugin[Simple Theme Plugin] documentation.
  We will have a demo for it on Wednesday.
* Create a new microsite on github.io or jenkins.io with themes listing (aka "theme marketplace").

|=========================================================


Other projects:

* Modification of link:/doc/book/managing/plugins/[Jenkins Plugin Manager] pages:
  Better plugin visualization and search
* Credentials Plugin UI improvements
* Git Plugin: Prevent duplication of side panel actions when checking out multiple repositories (e.g. Pipeline libraries)
* Pipeline visualization (advanced topic).
  We would like to improve the built-in Pipeline visualization in Jenkins.
* New UI samples for plugin developers in the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/ui-samples-plugin[UI Samples Plugin]

  submit patches and discovered issues.
