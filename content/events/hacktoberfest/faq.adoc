NOTE: You can find Hacktoberfest FAQ link:https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/faq[here].
Below you can find answer to some Jenkins-specific questions.

== Committers

This section provides answers to anyone who wants to participate in Hacktoberfest and
to submit pull requests to the Jenkins project.

=== I am new to Jenkins, how do I start?

If you are new to Jenkins,
you could start by fixing some small and well described issues in the featured projects.
There are lists of such newbie-friendly issues, see the links in our link:/events/hacktoberfest#featured-projects[featured project list].
You can also submit your own issue and propose a fix.

=== How do I mark my pull requests?

This year Hacktoberfest does not set any special requirements for marking pull request.
Any pull requests submitted between Oct 01 and Oct 31 will be counted towards the goal, 
unless they are marked as invalid by maintainers.
Still, we ask contributors to mark their pull requests so that we can track Hacktoberfest statistics on the Jenkins side.
There are three ways:

* If you are not a member of the Jenkins organization,
  put "Hacktoberfest" in your pull request titles
* If you are a member of the Jenkins organization on GitHub, 
  CC `@jenkinsci/hacktoberfest` or `@jenkins-infra/hacktoberfest` in your pull requests
* If you have `Write` or `Triage` permissions in the repository,
  just put the `hacktoberfest` label on the pull requests

=== I want to work on my own plugin, is it fine?

Yes, it is fine!
Any contributions count, your role in a repository does not matter.
Just make sure you create pull requests instead of direct pushes
(hint: it's a best practice anyway if you have a CI configured for your repository).

=== How to find documentation?

Jenkins project contains lots of materials about contributing to the project.
Here are some links which may help:

* link:/participate/[Participate] - landing page for newcomer contributors
* link:/blog/2017/08/07/intro-to-plugin-development/[Plugin Development Tutorials]
* link:/doc/developer/[Developer Documentation]
* link:https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/hacktoberfest[Gitter channel] for Q&A

Projects in the table above also have their own documentation to help newcomers.

=== How do I get reviews?

All featured projects are monitored by their maintainers,
and you will likely get a review within few days.
Reviews in other repositories and plugins may take longer.
In case of delays, ping us in the link:https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/hacktoberfest[hacktoberfest] channel in Gitter.
Unmerged pull-requests also count in Hacktoberfest,
so merge delays won't block you from getting prizes.

=== I am stuck. How do I get help?

* For general questions (process and general direction) use our link:https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/hacktoberfest[Hacktoberfest Gitter channel]
* You can also use other link:/chat[chats] or
link:/mailing-lists/[mailing lists].
Many subprojects also have their own chats, and we encourage using them if you want to reach out to the wider community.

=== Does Jenkins project send special swag?

All participants will get swag from Hacktoberfest organizers if they create at least 4 pull requests.
Jenkins project may also distribute some swag to top contributors,
depending on the budget and contributions. 

== Event organizers

=== How do I organize a Hacktoberfest event?

See our link:/events/hacktoberfest/event-kit[Event Kit].

== Maintainers

=== How do I mark my project as a featured one? 

New featured projects are welcome!
Please submit a pull request to update the link:/events/hacktoberfest[Hacktoberfest page] to get it added.

Conditions for being added as a featured project:

* There is a commitment from the maintainer(s) to provide timely reviews for incoming PRs
* There are explicit contributing guidelines for the component
* There are at least 5 newbie-friendly issues in Jenkins JIRA or GitHub Issues.
  We recommend putting the `hacktoberfest` label on them as well

=== How do I join the Hacktoberfest reviewers team?

You can request joining link:https://github.com/orgs/jenkinsci/teams/hacktoberfest[@jenkinsci/hacktoberfest] or link:https://github.com/orgs/jenkins-infra/teams/hacktoberfest[@jenkins-infra/hacktoberfest] from GitHub.
You need to be a member of a respective GitHub organization to send such request.

== Organizers

=== How do I get metrics about Hacktoberfest?

Unfortunately there is no way to get organization-wide metrics for Hacktoberfest,
because the event organizers do not share info about registered users.
This is why we recommend to mark pull request with `hacktoberfest` label or "Hacktoberfest" in the title.
Some queries which can help to get insights:

* link:https://github.com/search?q=org%3Ajenkinsci+org%3Ajenkins-infra+org%3Ajenkins-zh+is%3Apr+created%3A%3E2019-09-29+label%3Ahacktoberfest&type=Issues[Hacktoberfest 2019 pull requests with the "hacktoberfest" label]
* link:https://github.com/search?q=org%3Ajenkinsci+org%3Ajenkins-infra+org%3Ajenkins-zh+is%3Apr+created%3A%3E2019-09-29+-label%3Ahacktoberfest+hacktoberfest&type=Issues[Hacktoberfest 2019 pull requests with the "hacktoberfest" text which have not been labeled yet]

Also, CD Foundation metrics can be used to get some insights. 
These metrics apply to `jenkinsci` and `jenkins-infra` organizations only.
