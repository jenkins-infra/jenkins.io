NOTE: You can find Hacktoberfest FAQ link:https://hacktoberfest.com/about/[here].
Below you can find answers to some Jenkins-specific questions.


== Committers

This section provides answers to anyone who wants to participate in Hacktoberfest and
to submit pull requests to the Jenkins project.


=== I am new to Jenkins, how do I start?

If you are new to Jenkins,
you could start by fixing some small and well described issues in the featured projects.
There are lists of such newbie-friendly issues, see the links in our link:/events/hacktoberfest#featured-projects[featured project list].
You can also submit your own issue and propose a fix.


=== How do I mark my pull requests?

On Oct 03, the Hacktoberfest organizers link:https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/[made an update] to reduce spam and to introduce maintainer opt-in.
We follow the same policy in the Jenkins community,
and we do **NOT** require all maintainers to participate in Hacktoberfest.

We ask contributors to mark their pull requests so that we can help with having proper labels set:

* If a repository already has the `hacktoberfest` topic set,
  no extra steps required. Just submit a pull request!
** link:https://github.com/search?q=org%3Ajenkinsci+org%3Ajenkins-infra+org%3Ajenkins-zh+topic%3Ahacktoberfest[List of repositories marked for Hacktoberfest]
* If you are not a repository maintainer:
.. Add `Hacktoberfest` to the beginning of your pull request title.
.. Reference the pull request in link:https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#jenkinsci_hacktoberfest:gitter.im[our Gitter chat].
   We will contact maintainers to get the GitHub topic set.
* If you are a repository maintainer, just add the `hacktoberfest` GitHub topic.


=== I want to work on my own plugin, is it fine?

Yes, it is fine!
Any contributions count, your role in a repository does not matter.
Just make sure you create pull requests instead of direct pushes
(hint: it's a best practice anyway if you have a CI configured for your repository).

=== How to find documentation?

Jenkins project contains lots of materials about contributing to the project.
Here are some links which may help:

* link:/participate/[Participate] - landing page for newcomer contributors
* link:/blog/2017/08/07/intro-to-plugin-development/[Plugin Development Tutorials]
* link:/doc/developer/[Developer Documentation]
* link:https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#jenkinsci_hacktoberfest:gitter.im[Gitter channel] for Q&A

Suggested project ideas also have their own documentation to help newcomers.


=== How do I get reviews?

All featured projects are monitored by their maintainers and you will likely get a review within a few days.
Reviews in other repositories and plugins may take longer.
In case of delays, ping us in the link:https://matrix.to/#/#jenkinsci_hacktoberfest:gitter.im[hacktoberfest] channel in Gitter.
Unmerged pull-requests can also count in Hacktoberfest, as long as it has the `hacktoberfest-accepted` label and has an approving review, so merge delays won't block you from getting the digital reward.


=== I am stuck. How do I get help?

* For general questions (process and general direction) use our link:https://matrix.to/#/#jenkinsci_hacktoberfest:gitter.im[Hacktoberfest Gitter channel]
* You can also use other link:/chat[chats] or
link:/mailing-lists/[mailing lists].
Many subprojects also have their own chats, and we encourage using them if you want to reach out to the wider community.


=== Does Jenkins project send special swag?

All participants will get the digital rewards directly from the Hacktoberfest organizers if they have created at least 6 pull requests in the month of October.
The Jenkins project may also distribute some swag to top contributors, depending on the budget and contributions.


== Event organizers

=== How do I organize a Hacktoberfest event?

// Due to COVID-19, Hacktoberfest recommends that all events be online-only rather than in-person meetups.
If you're hosting a Hacktoberfest online meetup related to Jenkins, share it with the rest of the world as a link:/events/online-meetup/[Jenkins Online Meetup].
See our link:/events/hacktoberfest/event-kit[Event Kit] for more details.


== Maintainers

=== How do I mark my project as a featured one? 

New featured projects are welcome!
Please submit a pull request to update the link:/events/hacktoberfest[Hacktoberfest page] to get it added.

Conditions for being added as a featured project:

* There is a commitment from the maintainer(s) to provide timely reviews for incoming PRs
* There are explicit contributing guidelines for the component
* There are at least 5 newbie-friendly issues in Jenkins JIRA or GitHub Issues.
  We recommend putting the `hacktoberfest` label on them as well

=== How do I join the Hacktoberfest reviewers team?

You can request joining link:https://github.com/orgs/jenkinsci/teams/hacktoberfest[@jenkinsci/hacktoberfest] or link:https://github.com/orgs/jenkins-infra/teams/hacktoberfest[@jenkins-infra/hacktoberfest] from GitHub.
You need to be a member of a respective GitHub organization to send such request.


== Organizers

=== How do I get metrics about Hacktoberfest?

Unfortunately there is no way to get organization-wide metrics for Hacktoberfest,
because the event organizers do not share info about registered users.
This is why we recommend to mark pull requests with `hacktoberfest`, `hacktoberfest-accepted` label or `Hacktoberfest` in the title.

// Some queries which can help to get insights:
