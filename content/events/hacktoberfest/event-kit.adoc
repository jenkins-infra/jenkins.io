## Introduction

Hacktoberfest is an online event,
but there are many events being organized by open-source communities.
You can join one of link:https://hacktoberfest.com/events/[these events].
We encourage link:/projects/jam/[Jenkins Area Meetup (JAM)] organizers and contributors to
run Jenkins-specific events in October (workshops, hackergartens, hackathons, etc.).


## How to organize an event?

If you are a meetup organizer, just use your existing link:/projects/jam/[Jenkins Area Meetup] to run the event.
Evening events could follow the recommended JAM schedule,
but it is also possible to organize a full-day event.

If you are not a meetup organizer but want to host a meetup,
please ping us in link:https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#jenkinsci_hacktoberfest:gitter.im[our Gitter channel] so that we can help with reaching out to meetup organizers.

Steps:

* Find a venue, set the date
* Schedule a meetup and announce it, preferably as a link:/projects/jam/[Jenkins Area Meetup]
* Register the meetup on the Hacktoberfest site (see the link:https://hacktoberfest.com/events/#organizers[Event Kit])
* Add a meetup to link:/events/hacktoberfest[our Hacktoberfest page] and
  then add it to the list of events (link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc#adding-an-event[guide]). 
  It can be done in a single pull request.

## Sample agenda and resources

link:https://hacktoberfest.com/events/#organizers[Hacktoberfest Event Kit] offers a good sample agenda for events, 
you can stick to it.

There are few name/topics we advertise:

* Contributing intro meetup - 
  Meetup with introduction to Hacktoberfest and talks about contributing to Jenkins: 
  how to contribute, success stories, live demos.
* Hackathon - 
  Event where participants split to teams and work together on a limited number of predefined topics (e.g. see link:/events/hacktoberfest/#featured-projects[featured projects])
* Hackergarten/workshop - 
  Hack and study together. 
  Combines show-and-tell presentations and some time for participants to hack something.
  See the link:https://hackergarten.net/[Hackergarten] page for more info
* Jenkins and Friends - 
  Joint meetup with other groups and open-source projects. 
  Work together on on integrating your projects with Jenkins or
  adopting modern Jenkins features in your projects,
  e.g. Jenkins Pipeline or Configuration as Code. 

## Reusable slidedecks
