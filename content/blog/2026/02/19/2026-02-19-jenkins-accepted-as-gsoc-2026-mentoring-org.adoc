We are thrilled to announce that Jenkins has been accepted as a mentoring organization for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2026!
This marks our tenth year participating in this prestigious program, and we are excited to continue welcoming new contributors to our community.

GSoC is an incredible opportunity for aspiring developers to gain hands-on experience in open-source software development.
By participating in GSoC, contributors can work on real-world projects, collaborate with experienced mentors, and make meaningful contributions to the Jenkins ecosystem.
We are committed to providing a supportive and inclusive environment for all GSoC participants, and we look forward to seeing another summer of fruitful contributions that will emerge from this year's program.

We encourage all interested candidates to start preparing their applications and to join our upcoming webinars where we will discuss potential project ideas and provide guidance on the application process.
Stay tuned for more details on how to get involved and make the most of this exciting opportunity!
