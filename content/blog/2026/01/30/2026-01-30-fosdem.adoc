== Meet Jenkins at FOSDEM Brussels

We’re excited to share that **Jenkins has a stand at FOSDEM in Brussels** this year!

If you’re attending, come by the Jenkins booth to say hello. Whether you want to talk CI/CD best practices, share what you’re building with Jenkins, ask questions, or just geek out about automation, we’d love to chat.

=== What is FOSDEM?
FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Developers' European Meeting) is one of the largest gatherings of open-source enthusiasts in Europe. It’s a free event that brings together developers, contributors, and users from around the world to share knowledge, collaborate on projects, and celebrate open-source software.

FOSDEM is all about community, and this is a great chance to meet Jenkins contributors and users face to face.

👉 **Will you be at FOSDEM?**
Drop by the Jenkins stand and let’s talk — see you there!
