The JUnit plugin has received a major redesign, focusing on a cleaner and more consistent UI. This work draws directly
from the Pipeline Graph View plugin and the Jenkins Design Library, bringing much-needed polish to one of Jenkins'
oldest plugins.

=== So what's new?

**New user interface**

The plugin has been redesigned to make test results easier to understand at a glance. Pages have been streamlined,
components simplified and standardized, and the overall experience given a major cleanup.

Test names are split more intuitively, based on method, class, and package. This makes scanning large test suites easier.

Stacktraces are now also syntax-highlighted for better readability, and they can now be copied with a single click.

**Responsive**

The interface now scales from the largest screen to the smallest, so you can check results even on the go.

**Moments of joy**

When all of your tests pass, enjoy link:https://ci.jenkins.io/job/Core/job/jenkins/job/master/lastSuccessfulBuild/testReport/[celebratory confetti]. Because we know the satisfaction of watching a suite go green after a stubborn failure.

=== Available now ðŸš€

The update is available now for users on Jenkins 2.504.3 and later.

See it in action in the link:https://ci.jenkins.io/job/Core/job/jenkins/job/master/lastUnstableBuild/testReport/[Jenkins core build on ci.jenkins.io].
