== From Manual to Automated

In link:/blog/2023/03/30/android-and-jenkins/[March 2023], I explored running Jenkins on Android devices using Termux, demonstrating that it's technically possible to transform aging smartphones into CI/CD infrastructure. The manual setup worked, but it required 2-3 hours of configuration and was error-prone.

Fast forward to 2025: I've automated the entire process using Infrastructure as Code principles. What once took hours of manual configuration now completes in 15 minutes with a single command. This article presents the automation solution and the lessons learned while building it.

== Why Automate Jenkins on Android?

Before diving into the technical solution, let's address the "why":

* **Reproducibility**: Manual setups are difficult to replicate across multiple devices. Automation ensures consistency.
* **E-waste reduction**: Millions of functional Android devices sit in drawers. Why not repurpose them as build agents?
* **Learning opportunity**: Building this automation taught valuable lessons about service management, SSH configuration, and testing methodologies.
* **Cost-effective CI/CD**: For small projects, hobbyists, or educational environments, repurposed phones offer free compute.

The goal wasn't just to automate *my* setup—it was to create a reproducible solution anyone could use.

== The Infrastructure as Code Solution

The complete automation is available at link:https://github.com/gounthar/termux-jenkins-automation[github.com/gounthar/termux-jenkins-automation]. The solution uses:

* **Ansible**: Infrastructure automation across 8 reusable roles
* **Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasC)**: Declarative Jenkins configuration
* **Termux**: Linux environment on Android without root access

=== Architecture Overview

The automation deploys a complete Jenkins infrastructure on a single Android device:

[source,text]
----
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│      Android Phone (Termux)         │
│  ┌────────────────────────────────┐ │
│  │  Jenkins Controller (Minimal)  │ │
│  │  - Port 8080 (Web UI)          │ │
│  │  - JCasC configured            │ │
│  └──────────┬─────────────────────┘ │

│  │  - 2 executors                 │ │
│  └────────────────────────────────┘ │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
----

The controller handles job orchestration while delegating builds to the agent (on the same device). This architecture mirrors production setups and teaches Jenkins best practices.

=== Eight Ansible Roles

The automation is organized into focused, reusable roles:

1. **termux-base**: Core Termux setup (SSH, Python, package management)
2. **termux-complete-setup**: Comprehensive package installation (59+ packages including build tools, languages, dev tools)
3. **jenkins-controller**: Jenkins installation and initialization
4. **jenkins-agent**: SSH agent configuration and workspace setup
5. **jenkins-jcasc**: Configuration as Code deployment
6. **jenkins-backup**: Job and configuration backup utilities
7. **termux-boot-setup**: Optional auto-start on device boot
8. **termux-buildtools**: Legacy build tools (superseded by termux-complete-setup)

Each role is idempotent and can be run independently or as part of the complete setup playbook.

=== Quick Start

The main orchestration playbook ties everything together:

[source,bash]
----
# On the Android device (in Termux)
pkg install openssh python
sshd
passwd
whoami
ifconfig wlan0

# On your laptop/PC
git clone https://github.com/gounthar/termux-jenkins-automation.git
cd termux-jenkins-automation
./scripts/run-setup.sh

# Answer prompts:
# - IP address (from ifconfig)
# - SSH port (8022 default)
# - Username (from whoami)
# - Jenkins admin password
# - Authentication method (SSH key recommended)

# Wait ~15 minutes

# Access Jenkins:
# http://<phone-ip>:8080
----

The script handles prerequisites checking, inventory configuration, and playbook execution. No manual Ansible configuration required.

== Key Technical Insights

Building this automation revealed several important lessons:

=== Service Management: runit over Background Processes

Initially, I ran Jenkins as a background process (`java -jar jenkins.war &`). This approach had problems:

* Process dies when terminal closes
* No automatic restart on failure
* No log management
* Difficult to monitor

The solution: Termux's service management system using `runit` and `sv`:

[source,bash]
----
# Jenkins runs as a managed service
sv status jenkins
# Output: run: jenkins: (pid 31647) 95s; run: log: (pid 26734) 4516s

# Service management commands
sv up jenkins      # Start
sv down jenkins    # Stop
sv restart jenkins # Restart
----

Logs are handled by `svlogd` with automatic rotation:

[source,bash]
----
# View live logs
tail -f ~/.jenkins/logs/current

# All logs automatically rotated and compressed
ls -lh ~/.jenkins/logs/
----

This mirrors production service management and prevents the "my Jenkins died overnight" problem.

=== Fresh Installation Testing

The biggest mistake: testing only on my development phone. The automation worked perfectly—on the device I'd been configuring manually for weeks.

When I tested on a fresh Termux installation, it failed immediately. Missing dependencies that I'd installed manually months ago weren't in the playbooks.

**The fix**: Systematic fresh installation testing on multiple devices. This revealed:

* Missing repository configurations (needed `root-repo` and `pointless` repos for `gcc-8`)
* Undocumented package dependencies
* SSH key permission issues
* Service startup race conditions

Fresh installation testing became part of the development workflow. Every change was validated on a wiped device.

**Current success rate**: 98% on fresh Termux installations (the 2% failure is usually network timeouts during package installation).

=== Jenkins Configuration as Code

Manual Jenkins configuration through the UI isn't reproducible. The solution: JCasC (Jenkins Configuration as Code).

Complete Jenkins configuration in YAML:

[source,yaml]
----
jenkins:
  systemMessage: "Jenkins on Android (Termux) - Automated Setup"
  numExecutors: 0  # Controller doesn't run builds
  securityRealm:
    local:
      users:
        - id: "admin"
          password: "${JENKINS_ADMIN_PASSWORD:-admin}"

credentials:
  system:
    domainCredentials:
      - domain:
          name: "SSH Agent Credentials"
        credentials:
          - basicSSHUserPrivateKey:
              id: "termux-agent-key"
              privateKeySource:
                directEntry:
                  privateKey: "${readFile:/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.jenkins/ssh/id_ed25519}"

nodes:
  - permanent:
      name: "termux-agent-1"
      remoteFS: "/data/data/com.termux/files/home/jenkins-agent"
      launcher:
        ssh:
          host: "localhost"
          port: 8022
          credentialsId: "termux-agent-key"
----

The automation deploys this configuration, and Jenkins applies it on startup. No clicking through UI settings.

== Lessons for Production Jenkins

While this project targets Android devices, the patterns apply to any Jenkins deployment:

* **Infrastructure as Code**: All configuration in version control
* **Service Management**: Proper process supervision (systemd, runit, etc.)
* **Configuration as Code**: JCasC for reproducible Jenkins configuration
* **Fresh Installation Testing**: Never assume dependencies are present
* **Modular Roles**: Break automation into focused, reusable components

The termux-jenkins-automation repository demonstrates these principles in a constrained environment (no root, mobile platform, limited resources). If it works on Android, these patterns will definitely work on traditional servers.

== What's Next?

The automation is production-ready for single-device setups. Future enhancements could include:

* **Multi-device clustering**: Coordinate multiple Android phones as a Jenkins cluster
* **Plugin automation**: Automated plugin installation and updates
* **Backup/restore workflows**: Scheduled backups to cloud storage
* **Performance optimization**: Memory tuning for constrained devices
* **Monitoring integration**: Prometheus metrics export

The foundation is solid. The patterns are proven. The infrastructure is code.

== Try It Yourself

The complete automation, documentation, and troubleshooting guides are available at:

link:https://github.com/gounthar/termux-jenkins-automation[]

Requirements:
* Android device with Termux installed
* Laptop/PC with Ansible 2.10+
* 15 minutes

Whether you're repurposing e-waste, building a home lab, or learning Jenkins administration, this automation provides a reproducible path from bare Android device to functioning Jenkins infrastructure.

From manual experiment to automated solution—that's the Infrastructure as Code journey.
