== Maintainers

Jenkins plugin maintainers can prepare for Hacktoberfest contributions by following these best practices:

* Add the "hacktoberfest" topic to your repository to opt in to Hacktoberfest and indicate you’re looking for contributions.  Only add the "hacktoberfest" topic to your repository if you are willing to promptly review Hacktoberfest pull requests
* Add a CONTRIBUTING.md file with contribution guidelines to your repository
* Apply the "good-first-issue" label to link:https://github.com/search?q=org%3Ajenkinsci+is%3Aissue+label%3Agood-first-issue+is%3Aopen&type=issues/[GitHub issues] you want contributors to help with in your GitHub project
* Add the “newbie-friendly” label to link:https://issues.jenkins.io/issues/?filter=20847/[Jira issues] that are well suited to new contributors
* Choose issues that have a well-defined scope and are self-contained
* Be ready to review pull requests, accepting those that are valid by merging them, leaving an overall approving review, or by adding the "hacktoberfest-accepted" label
* Reject any spammy requests you receive by labeling them as "spam" and any other invalid contributions by closing them or labeling them as "invalid"
