We’re happy to announce that link:https://jenkins.io/changelog-stable/2.492.1[Jenkins 2.492.1] comes with a
brand-new search experience. We're calling it *Command Palette* and it's a one-stop shop for
searching across __everything__ in Jenkins.

Whether you’re searching for jobs, builds, or settings, Command Palette makes it faster
and easier than ever to find exactly what you need.

Command Palette is a full-screen search experience, giving you more room to view results and
access richer, more detailed information. Results are now presented with clear and helpful icons,
improving visibility and making it easier to identify what you’re looking for at a glance.

Command Palette is also incredibly accessible - just press `CMD+K` (on macOS)
or `CTRL+K` (on Windows/Linux) from any page to open it instantly. Alternatively, you can find it
located in the navigation bar.

This feature and more are now available as part of the latest Jenkins release.
