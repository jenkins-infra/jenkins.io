We are excited to have been accepted to https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/[Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2025]! This marks our ninth year participating as a mentoring organization in the program. Thank you Google!

GSoC is more than just a mentoring program; it is an opportunity to welcome and engage new contributors in open-source development. By dedicating time to mentor and guide GSoC contributors, we help shape the future of both the individuals involved and the broader Jenkins community. The impact of these contributions extends beyond the program, benefiting countless Jenkins users worldwide.

We eagerly welcome new GSoC contributors to the Jenkins family! This journey will provide invaluable hands-on experience, technical skill enhancement, and insight into the workings of an active open-source community. Most importantly, participants will have the chance to learn from passionate mentors dedicated to making a meaningful difference—for both individual contributors and the Jenkins project as a whole.
