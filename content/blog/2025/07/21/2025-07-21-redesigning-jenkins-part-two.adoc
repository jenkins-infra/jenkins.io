In link:/blog/2025/03/26/design-post/[Part One] we discussed the motivation behind redesigning Jenkins,
the most used CI/CD platform in the world, and the technical challenges that arise when doing so.

Today, we’ll dive deeper into the design decisions behind some of the new UI features, how we’re improving the developer
experience, and what we’re doing to ensure compatibility across the plugin ecosystem without slowing down progress.

== Part Two - Lift-off

With Jenkins 2.516.1, we’re introducing a brand-new user interface — the result of years of dedicated work by the
community. This release marks a major milestone in the evolution of Jenkins, with nearly every part of the interface
thoughtfully refined for clarity, usability, and performance. From the navigation and theming to pipeline visualization
and customization, the entire experience has been reimagined to better serve both new users and long-time contributors.

=== Refined interface

</div>

One of the most noticeable changes in Jenkins 2.516.1 is the introduction of the redesigned header. This new header
merges the traditional top bar and breadcrumb navigation into a single, streamlined component. The result is a cleaner,
more modern interface that not only looks better but also improves usability by saving valuable vertical
space—approximately 60 pixels per page.

Beyond its appearance, the new header is fully responsive. Breadcrumbs and actions dynamically adjust to different
screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience across devices. Additionally, global actions like Manage Jenkins, which
were previously only accessible from the main dashboard, are now embedded directly into the header. This change makes
essential controls available from any page, reducing unnecessary navigation and improving overall efficiency.

=== Revamped pipeline visualisation

Pipelines are central to how Jenkins automates the process of building, testing, and deploying software. They outline
the entire workflow from code commit to production. As these pipelines become more complex, it can be challenging to
track progress or identify issues. This is where pipeline visualization becomes essential - turning a series of
abstract steps into a clear, interactive flow.

The link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-graph-view/[Pipeline Graph View] plugin introduces a visual layer to
Jenkins pipelines, displaying each stage of a run in a clean, intuitive graph. It’s designed to help users quickly
grasp the structure and status of their pipelines at a glance.

This year, the plugin has been completely rebuilt, and the response from the community has been _fantastic_. We've moved
the plugin from Webpack to Rspack and Vite, and replacing class components with functional ones. This cleanup removed
thousands of lines of code, improving performance and maintainability.

The new interface, based on the link:https://weekly.ci.jenkins.io/design-library/[Jenkins Design Library], now supports
full-page scrolling, sticky headings, and pan-and-zoom capabilities for the pipeline graph. New animations, loading
skeletons, and clear stage progress indicators create a smoother, more responsive user experience.

A unified view brings together the pipeline graph, stage details, and logs into a single layout, so you can now track
execution and output in one place. The layout is customizable - the graph can be moved and columns resized or hidden.

Finally, performance has been significantly boosted. The plugin loads faster, scrolls more smoothly, and
handles large pipelines more efficiently than ever before.

=== New ways to customize Jenkins

Jenkins 2.516.1 is the most customizable version of Jenkins yet. We've more themes than ever, and a whole new way of
changing themes on the fly. Simply hover over your user account icon to get access to the new theme picker.

Make Jenkins your own - with a new link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/dark-theme/[Dark theme], link:https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/[Ethan Schoonover's] incredibly popular theme returns with a new release for Jenkins,
link:https://catppuccin.com[Cattpuccin for Jenkins], Chocolate theme - Indulge your Jenkins in rich, dark tones with golden highlights for a refined, elegant developer experience.

Want to create your own theme? we have a branch new Maven arcehtype to make that easy - check it out.

On top of that, there’s the link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/customizable-header/[Customizable Header Plugin]. This
lets you fully customize the new header - change the logo, links, or actions to tailor Jenkins to your organization’s
workflow and brand.

=== Evolving the developer experience

Jenkins is powered by hundreds of contributors, but working with its proprietary technologies – particularly Jelly and
Stapler – can be a challenge for new developers.

===== Jenkins Design Library

At the end of last year, the link:https://weekly.ci.jenkins.io/design-library/[Jenkins Design Library 3] was
introduced - a major step forward in modernizing the Jenkins UI and improving the development experience. Jenkins Design
Library is a comprehensive system of reusable UI components, layout patterns, and style guidelines tailored
specifically for Jenkins. It standardizes how interfaces are built, ensuring consistency across plugins and core
features while aligning with modern web practices and accessibility standards.

For developers and contributors, this means a more efficient and reliable way to build user interfaces. Instead of
creating components from scratch or reverse-engineering existing ones, contributors can now rely on a shared set of
well-documented, pre-tested elements. This not only speeds up development and reduces bugs, but also makes it easier
for new contributors to get started and follow established UI conventions. Design Library 3 helps Jenkins stay visually
cohesive, easier to maintain, and more approachable for the growing community around it.

===== Plugin for IntelliJ

To help lower the barrier to entry, the Jenkins community offers an
link:https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1885-jenkins-development-support[IntelliJ IDEA plugin]. The plugin streamlines
Jenkins development in various ways, such as offering autocompletion and inline documentation for Jelly tags, as well as
autocomplete for link:https://weekly.ci.jenkins.io/design-library/symbols/[Jenkins Symbols]. This plugin significantly
improves the developer experience, especially for those unfamiliar with Jenkins’ older technologies. It reduces the
need to dig through source code or documentation to understand tag usage or symbol references, and instead provides
instant, in-context guidance. By making core development workflows more accessible and efficient, it helps new
contributors ramp up faster and experienced developers work with greater confidence.
