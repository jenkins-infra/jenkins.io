In link:/blog/2025/03/26/design-post/[Part One] we discussed the motivation behind redesigning Jenkins,
the most used CI/CD platform in the world, and the technical challenges that arise when doing so.

We’ll dive deeper into the design decisions behind some of the new UI features, how we’re improving the developer
experience, and what we’re doing to ensure compatibility across the plugin ecosystem without slowing down progress.

== Part Two - TODO

With Jenkins 2.516.1, we're introducing a new UI.

This is the culmination of years of work

every part of jenkins has been refined

=== Refined interface

The most noticeable change is thew new Jenkins header. It’s been redesigned, merging the header and breadcrumb bar to
save space. The header is now responsive too, so breadcrumbs and actions truncate as your screen size changes.
Global actions, such as Manage Jenkins, were only previously accessible from the dashboard. These have been moved
into the header, meaning that they’re accessible from every page.

Saving 60?px per page

=== Revamped pipeline visualisation

Pipelines are central to how Jenkins automates the process of building, testing, and deploying software. They outline
the entire workflow from code commit to production. As these pipelines become more complex, it can be challenging to
track progress or identify issues. This is where pipeline visualization becomes essential - turning a series of
abstract steps into a clear, interactive flow.

The link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-graph-view/[Pipeline Graph View] plugin introduces a visual layer to
Jenkins pipelines, displaying each stage of a run in a clean, intuitive graph. It’s designed to help users quickly
grasp the structure and status of their pipelines at a glance.

This year, the plugin has been completely rebuilt, and the response from developers has been fantastic. We've moved the
plugin from Webpack to Rspack and Vite, and replacing class components with functional ones. This cleanup removed
thousands of lines of code, improving performance and maintainability.

The new interface, based on the link:https://weekly.ci.jenkins.io/design-library/[Jenkins Design Library], now supports
full-page scrolling, sticky headings, and pan-and-zoom capabilities for the pipeline graph. New animations, loading
skeletons, and clear stage progress indicators create a smoother, more responsive user experience.

A unified view brings together the pipeline graph, stage details, and logs into a single layout, so you can now track
execution and output in one place. The layout is customizable - the graph can be moved and columns resized or hidden.

Finally, performance has been significantly boosted. The plugin loads faster, scrolls more smoothly, and
handles large pipelines more efficiently than ever before.

=== New ways to customize Jenkins

Jenkins 2.516.1 is the most customizable version of Jenkins yet. We've more themes than ever, and a whole new way of
changing themes on the fly. Simply hover over your user account icon to get access to the new theme picker.

Make Jenkins your own - with a new link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/dark-theme/[Dark theme], link:https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/[Ethan Schoonover's] incredibly popular theme returns with a new release for Jenkins,

On top of that, there’s the link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/customizable-header/[Customizable Header Plugin]. This
lets you fully customize the new header - change the logo, links, or actions to tailor Jenkins to your organization’s
workflow and brand.

=== Evolving the developer experience

Jenkins is powered by hundreds of contributors, but working with its proprietary technologies – particularly Jelly and
Stapler – can be a challenge for new developers.

To help lower the barrier to entry, the Jenkins community offers an
link:https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1885-jenkins-development-support[IntelliJ IDEA plugin]. The plugin streamlines
Jenkins development in various ways, such as offering autocompletion and inline documentation for Jelly tags, as well as
autocomplete for link:https://weekly.ci.jenkins.io/design-library/symbols/[Jenkins Symbols].

Jenkins Design Library 3 was introduced at the end of last year ...
