Amazon Web Services has graciously donated $60,000 in cloud credits to the Jenkins project.
Their continued support of the Jenkins project is massively important for several services and functions.
AWS' support for Jenkins over the years has enabled the Jenkins project to run its infrastructure and services efficiently.

AWS provides the central distribution point for Jenkins core and Jenkins plugin downloads through the Jenkins update center.
We've used link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-graviton-performance-testing/what-is-aws-graviton.html[AWS Graviton servers] (Arm architecture) and AWS Intel servers with the Amazon link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/what-is-eks.html[Elastic Kubernetes Service] and as link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html[Elastic Compute Cloud] virtual machines.

In addition to these services, link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4688[ci.jenkins.io was recently migrated to AWS] through the work of the Jenkins infrastructure team.
This migration was necessary so that Jenkins can continue to provide a stable and reliable environment for its users and community.
This was no small task, involving many moving parts and requiring careful planning and execution to ensure a smooth transition.
Without the support and sponsorship of AWS, this migration would not have been possible.

We are sincerely grateful for Amazon's most recent contribution to the Jenkins project and thank them for their continued support of open-source software.
