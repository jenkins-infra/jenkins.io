We’re proud to welcome **YourKit** as a new sponsor of the Jenkins project!

YourKit has generously provided free licenses for the *YourKit Java Profiler* to Jenkins core maintainers and active contributors. This tool is a powerful asset when analyzing performance regressions, debugging memory leaks, or resolving concurrency issues in Jenkins core and plugin code.

YourKit supports open source projects with innovative and intelligent tools for monitoring and profiling Java and .NET applications. YourKit is the creator of https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/[YourKit Java Profiler], https://www.yourkit.com/dotnet-profiler/[YourKit .NET Profiler], and https://www.yourkit.com/youmonitor/[YourKit YouMonitor].

While YourKit offers a suite of tools, this sponsorship specifically provides licenses for the *YourKit Java Profiler* to eligible Jenkins contributors.
