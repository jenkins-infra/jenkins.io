This post details the progress made during the first half of Google Summer of Code 2025 on the *link:/projects/gsoc/2025/projects/complete-alternative-jenkins-io-build-retooling/[Complete Build Retooling of jenkins.io]* project, which aims to modernize the Jenkins documentation infrastructure.

== Project Objectives

The initiative focuses on three core improvements to the Jenkins documentation system:

1. *Modernization*: Transitioning from legacy tools to contemporary solutions
2. *Performance*: Implementing faster build processes
3. *Organization*: Establishing clear separation between:
   * Versioned content (tied to LTS releases)
   * Non-versioned content (general documentation)

== Technical Implementation

=== Architecture Components

* *Antora*: Chosen for versioned documentation management
* *Vite.js*: Selected for non-versioned content after evaluating Gatsby
* *Material UI*: Implementing modern UI components
* *YAML*: Structured content management for dynamic pages

=== Migration Approach

The transition strategy involved:

1. *Content Analysis*:
   - Comprehensive audit of existing documentation
   - Identification of versioned vs. non-versioned content

2. *Toolchain Implementation*:
   - Automated content synchronization via Python scripts
   - Visual diff verification using Beyond Compare
   - Incremental page migration to ensure stability

== Coding Phase 1

You can see me pitch my presentation on the coding done up to the midterm phase link:[here].

== Progress Highlights

=== Documentation System (Antora)

* Successfully synchronized the docs.jenkins.io repository with current content of jenkins.io
* Resolved many broken navigation links across the documentation
* Established LTS 2.504x as the new branch with changes till 25 June
* Removed deprecated Gatsby infrastructure

=== Web Platform (Vite.js)

* Implemented a modern Vite.js foundation with:
  - Preview deployment capabilities
  - Automated branch protection
  - Integrated issue tracking
* Migrated core pages including:
  - Roadmap
  - Download
  - Events
  - Chat
  - Participate
  - Books
  - Awards
  - Avatars
  - Conduct
  - Mailing Lists

* Achieved near-perfect visual parity with existing jenkins.io
* Introduced system-aware dark/light mode

== Challenges Overcome

The migration presented several technical hurdles:

* *Content Structure*: Maintaining accurate inter-document relationships during transition
* *Tooling Transition*: Smooth migration from Gatsby to Vite.js mid-project
* *UI Consistency*: Ensuring pixel-perfect alignment with existing design
* *Workflow Management*: Coordinating multiple interdependent PRs

== Roadmap Ahead

The final phase will focus on:

1. Completing migration of remaining components:
   - Security advisories
   - Changelogs
   - Blog
   - Home page

2. Performance optimization:
   - Build time improvements
   - Asset delivery optimization

3. Final integration:
   - Unified platform architecture
   - Comprehensive SEO implementation

== Acknowledgments

This project's progress owes much to the exceptional guidance from my mentors: *author:krisstern[Kris Stern]*, *author:gounthar[Bruno Verachten]*, *author:kmartens27[Kevin Martens]*, and *author:iamrajiv[Rajiv Singh]*. Their technical expertise and strategic advice have been instrumental in navigating the project's complexities.

For me, the learning has been immense — not only in terms of technical depth, but also in strengthening collaboration, communication, and open-source best practices.

Additional thanks to the Jenkins GSoC org admins for their support and for fostering such a collaborative open-source environment.

The second half of GSoC promises exciting developments as we work toward delivering a modern, high-performance documentation platform for the Jenkins community.
