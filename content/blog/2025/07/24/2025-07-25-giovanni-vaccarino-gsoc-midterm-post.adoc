Hello everyone!

I'm Giovanni Vaccarino, and I’m working on the project *AI-Powered Chatbot for Quick Access to Jenkins Resources* for my Google Summer of Code 2025. I'm working at the development of a Jenkins plugin that integrates an AI chatbot that helps users to quickly find relevant Jenkins documentation, plugins, and other community resources. We've just crossed the halfway of July, so we're past the middle of this journey and today I'd like to provide updates on the project.

== What I've Accomplished So Far

Up to now the main contributions to the project have been:

* Built the complete *data pipeline* for the RAG-based chatbot, from data collection to embedding and vector storage
* Implemented a *REST API* to serve the chatbot functionalities
* Developed the *plugin UI*, integrated into the Jenkins user interface
* Written unit and integration *tests* for both the backend and frontend components
* Continuosly update the project *documentation*

== What I've Learned

While this journey has been full of technical growth, GSoC has been about much more than just writing code. It’s been about having meaningful discussions, valuable mentorship and collaboration by exchanging ideas and opinions.

== What's Next?

With several weeks still ahead, I'm fully committed to continue the work on the project. The second phase will focus on enhancing response quality of the responses by exploring agentic approaches and building more complex chains and flows to provide better replies.

== Acknowledgements

A huge thank you to my mentors — *Vutukuri Sreenivas*, *Kris Stern*, *Bervianto Leo Pratama*, and *Bruno Verachten*— for their incredible availability throughout the entire period, always quick to respond to any question and consistently present for code reviews and valuable guidance.

Also, a big thanks to the Jenkins org admins — *Kris Stern*, *Bruno Verachten*, and *Alyssa Tong* — for their continous support throughout the coding period.
