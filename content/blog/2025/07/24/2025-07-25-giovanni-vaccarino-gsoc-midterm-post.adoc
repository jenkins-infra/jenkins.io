Hello everyone!

I'm Giovanni Vaccarino, and I’m working on the project *AI-Powered Chatbot for Quick Access to Jenkins Resources* as part of Google Summer of Code 2025. This project focuses on developing a Jenkins plugin that integrates an AI chatbot to help users quickly find relevant Jenkins documentation, plugins, and community resources.

We've just crossed the midpoint of July, so I'd like to share a progress update on the project.

== What I've Accomplished So Far

Here are the major milestones I've achieved in this period:

* Built the complete *data pipeline* for the RAG-based chatbot, from data collection to embedding and vector storage
* Implemented a *REST API* to serve the chatbot functionalities
* Developed the *plugin UI*, integrated into the Jenkins user interface
* Written unit and integration *tests* for both the backend and frontend components
* Continuosly update the project *documentation*

== What I've Learned

While this journey has been full of technical growth, GSoC has been about much more than just writing code. It’s been about having meaningful discussions, valuable mentorship and collaboration by exchanging ideas and opinions.

== What's Next?

With several weeks still ahead, I'm fully committed to continue the work on the project. The second phase will focus on enhancing response quality of the responses by exploring agentic approaches and building more complex chains and flows to provide better replies.

== Acknowledgements

A huge thank you to my mentors — *Vutukuri Sreenivas*, *Kris Stern*, *Bervianto Leo Pratama*, and *Bruno Verachten*— for their incredible availability throughout the entire period, always quick to respond to any question and consistently present for code reviews and valuable guidance.

Also, a big shout-out to the Jenkins org admins *Kris Stern*, *Bruno Verachten*, and *Alyssa Tong* for their continous support throughout the coding period.

I'm excited for the weeks ahead and to keep building with the Jenkins community!
