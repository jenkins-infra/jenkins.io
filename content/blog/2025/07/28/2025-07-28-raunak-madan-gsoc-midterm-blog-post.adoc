Hello everyone,

I’m Raunak Madan, currently working on the project link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-modernizer-tool[Improving Plugin Modernizer] — a generic CLI tool designed to automate the modernization of Jenkins plugins. It leverages OpenRewrite recipes to apply code transformations, validate the results, and create pull requests with the proposed changes. For a detailed overview of the project, please refer to the link:/projects/gsoc/2025/projects/plugin-modernizer-improvements/[project page].

We’ve reached halfway and successfully completed the first phase of the project.

== What we’ve accomplished so far?

* **Automatic Extraction of Modernization Metadata:** Record migration status, related pull requests , and more.
* **Metadata Publishing:** Automatically pushes metadata to a public GitHub repository.
* **GitHub Action Workflows**:
** Validate incoming metadata and auto-merge PRs.
** Dynamically update metadata.
** Consolidate metadata for each plugin.
** Generate comprehensive reports on applied recipes and plugin migrations to provide a high-level overview.

Check out the demonstration of the tool in the link:https://youtu.be/serD66DmEeU[Midterm Presentation].

== What I’ve Learned?

This experience has been a great opportunity for learning by doing. Beyond the technical skills, I think open source is not just about writing code, it’s about collaboration with the mentors and the community and having a shared growth mindset. Asking for help publicly, supporting others, and contributing back are core aspects of this culture.

== What’s Next?

* Automate running recipes on plugins with low health scores.
* Create and improve recipes (e.g., a recipe to migrate plugins to Java 25).
* Push consolidated metadata and reports to link:https://reports.jenkins.io/[Jenkins reports site].
