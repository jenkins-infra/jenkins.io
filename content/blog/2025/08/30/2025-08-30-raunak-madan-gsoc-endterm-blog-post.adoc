Hello everyone,

This blog showcases the work done on the link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-modernizer-tool[Plugin Modernizer Tool] during Google Summer of Code 2025. For a detailed description of the project, please refer to the link:/projects/gsoc/2025/projects/plugin-modernizer-improvements/[project page].

== About the Project

The project aims to extract modernization metadata, such as whether the modernization was successful and what PR it generated for the plugin, etc.
It helps to track the impact of the link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-modernizer-tool[plugin-modernizer-tool], the success and failure rate of the modernization.

We aim to extract the metadata and push to a public repository with additional actions over there, validating the changes. Additionally, we extract comprehensive reports on applied recipes and plugin migrations to provide a high-level overview.

== Phase 1

In this phase, we accomplished the following tasks:

* **Automatic Extraction of Modernization Metadata:** Record migration status, pull request URL and status, check runs information, and more.
* **Metadata Publishing:** Automatically pushes metadata to a public repository — link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/metadata-plugin-modernizer/[metadata-plugin-modernizer].
* **GitHub Action Workflows:**
** Validate incoming metadata and auto-merge PRs.
** Dynamically update metadata.
** Consolidate metadata for each plugin.
** Generate comprehensive reports on applied recipes and plugin migrations to provide a high-level overview.

Check out the demonstration of the tool from the link:/projects/gsoc/#gsoc-2025[Jenkins in Google Summer of Code page].

== Phase 2

In this phase, we accomplished the following tasks:

* **Created and Improved Recipes:** Added new recipes such as `Migrate to Java 25`, `Migrate Commons Lang 2 to Lang 3 and Commons Text`, and improved the `Migrate to JUnit 5` recipe.
* **Bug Fixes:** Resolved minor bugs.
* **Documentation**: Updated the documentation to be more beginner-friendly.

== Next Steps

* Push the consolidated metadata and the reports to the link:https://reports.jenkins.io/[Jenkins reports site].
* Visualizing the metadata on the link:https://stats.jenkins.io/[Jenkins statistics site].
* Automate Running Recipes on Plugins with Low Health Scores.

Reflecting back it was a really great experience with Jenkins, which enabled me to learn new skills, mindset, and make meaningful contributions.
Looking forward to continue contributing at Jenkins in the future.
