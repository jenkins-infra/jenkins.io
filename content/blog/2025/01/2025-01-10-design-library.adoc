Weâ€™re thrilled to announce that Jenkins Design Library 3 is now live! ðŸŽ‰ This marks a significant milestone, the result of an incredible collaborative effort from the community. With this release, weâ€™ve reimagined and refined the design experience to provide better tools for plugin developers and ensure a more consistent, accessible, and intuitive interface.

**So what's new?**

1. Consistent Design Across the Board

Every page has been refreshed to maintain a cohesive look and feel, making it easier than ever to work with Jenkins design guidelines.

2. Organized Samples

All samples are now grouped into clear categories: Components and Patterns, ensuring you can quickly find what you need.

3. Enhanced Page Descriptions

Each page now starts with a clear, consistent description to provide context at a glance.

4. Polished Content and Design

Weâ€™ve cleaned up content and visuals across the board, delivering a smoother and more professional experience.

5. Language Tabs for Samples

Inline tabs now let you seamlessly switch between different code samples, such as Jelly and Java, for better clarity and usability.

6. New â€˜Edit This Pageâ€™ Button

Want to contribute or suggest improvements? The new Edit This Page button makes it easy to jump in and collaborate.

7. Accessibility Improvements

The library now respects user preferences for contrast (prefers-contrast) and motion (prefers-reduced-motion), making it more accessible for everyone.

8. Updated Card Guidelines

Weâ€™ve revamped card design guidance to align with modern UI best practices.

9. LTS Version Availability

Pages can now declare which Long-Term Support (LTS) release theyâ€™re compatible with, so you always know where features are available.

**Available now ðŸš€**
