We’re thrilled to announce that link:https://weekly.ci.jenkins.io/design-library[**Jenkins Design Library 3**] is now live! 🎉

With this release, we’ve refined every aspect of the library to provide better documentation for plugin developers and ensure a more consistent,
accessible, and intuitive experience.

'''

=== So what's new?

**A new consistent design**

Every page has been refined to maintain a cohesive look and feel, making it easier than ever to work with Jenkins
Design Library. All samples are now grouped into two clear categories — Components and Patterns — ensuring you can quickly
find what you need. We've also introduced interactive examples, such as the new link:https://weekly.ci.jenkins.io/design-library/spacing[Spacing] sample, which'll make it
easier than ever to find the component or pattern best suited for your needs.

**New ‘Edit this page’ button**

Want to contribute or suggest improvements? The new 'Edit this page' button makes it easy to jump in and collaborate.

**Accessibility improvements**

The library now respects user preferences for contrast (prefers-contrast) and motion (prefers-reduced-motion), making it more accessible for everyone.

**Versions**

Pages can now declare which Long-Term Support (LTS) release they’re compatible with, so you always know where the latest components are available.
