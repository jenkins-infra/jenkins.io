Weâ€™re thrilled to announce that the link:https://weekly.ci.jenkins.io/design-library[**Jenkins Design Library 3**] is now live! ðŸŽ‰

With this release, weâ€™ve refined every aspect of the library to provide better documentation for plugin developers and ensure a more consistent,
accessible, and intuitive experience.

'''

=== So what's new?

**A new consistent design**

Every page has been refined to maintain a cohesive look and feel, making it easier than ever to work with Jenkins Design Library.
All samples are now grouped into two clear categories â€” Components and Patterns â€” ensuring you can quickly find what you need.
We've also introduced interactive examples, such as the new link:https://weekly.ci.jenkins.io/design-library/spacing[Spacing] sample, which will make it easier than ever to find the component or pattern best suited for your needs.

**New â€˜Edit this pageâ€™ button**

Want to contribute or suggest improvements?
The new 'Edit this page' button makes it easy to jump in and collaborate.

**Accessibility improvements**

The library now respects user preferences for contrast (prefers-contrast) and motion (prefers-reduced-motion), making it more accessible to everyone.

**Versions**

Pages can now declare which Long-Term Support (LTS) release theyâ€™re compatible with, so you always know where the latest components are available.
