We’re excited to announce a major update to the Pipeline Graph View plugin — a complete redesign that sets the stage for the future of Jenkins user experience.

Starting with Jenkins 2.479.3, the all-new Graph View is available to a wide range of users by default. This release reflects a fundamental shift in how Jenkins visualizes pipelines: more modern, more useful, and more flexible than ever before.

✨ What’s New?

🔄 Rewritten and Redesigned

This isn’t just a facelift — the plugin has been rebuilt from the ground up. It features a clean, modern interface built with today’s frontend technologies, designed to make complex pipelines easier to understand at a glance.

🎯 One Unified View

Say goodbye to toggling between separate views. The new interface combines the pipeline graph, logs, and step details into a single, streamlined layout. You can inspect a stage, follow its execution, and read its output — all in one place.

🖥️ Optimized for Wide Screens

Jenkins is used in environments with many monitors and large displays. We’ve introduced an optional layout that moves the graph to the left, making better use of widescreen real estate and reducing the need to scroll.

🎨 Customizable Layout

Prefer a stacked layout? Want the graph on top? Customize the view to match how you work. Your preferences are remembered — no more setting things up every time.

🚀 Performance and Usability Improvements

We’ve made significant behind-the-scenes improvements to how stages and logs are fetched and rendered. The new plugin loads faster, scrolls smoother, and handles larger pipelines more gracefully.

📈 More Information at a Glance

The redesigned graph and step views now expose more detailed information upfront, including step durations, log snippets, and errors, making debugging quicker and more intuitive.

🔮 A Glimpse at the Future of Jenkins UX

This release is more than just a plugin update — it’s a preview of where Jenkins is headed. We’re investing in a modern,
user-centered experience across the platform, and the Pipeline Graph View is a major step on that path.

We’re building this in the open and want to hear from you. Try out the new plugin and let us know what works, what doesn’t, and what you’d like to see next.
