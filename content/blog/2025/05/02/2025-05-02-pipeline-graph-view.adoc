We’re excited to announce a major update to the https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-graph-view/[Pipeline Graph View]
plugin - a complete redesign that sets the stage for the future of Jenkins user experience.

With this release, we're introducing a modern, user-focused interface that enhances pipeline visualization,
performance, and customization - marking a key step toward the future of the Jenkins user experience.

=== So what’s new?

**Rewritten and redesigned**

The plugin has been rebuilt from the ground up. It features a clean, modern interface built
with today’s frontend technologies, designed to make complex pipelines easier to understand at a glance.

**Unified view**

The new interface combines the Pipeline graph, stages, and logs into a single, streamlined layout. You can inspect a
stage, follow its execution, and read its output - all in one place.

**Customizable**

The Pipeline Graph View plugin now offers a more adaptable layout. The pipeline graph appears on top by default,
but users can move it to the left to better suit widescreen displays. Columns can be resized, and layout preferences
are saved automatically to streamline your workflow.

**Performance improvements**

We’ve made significant behind-the-scenes improvements to how stages and logs are fetched and rendered. The new plugin
loads faster, scrolls smoother, and handles larger pipelines more gracefully.

**A glimpse at the future of Jenkins UX**

This release is more than just a plugin update - it’s a preview of where Jenkins is headed. We’re investing in a modern,
user-centered experience across the platform, and the Pipeline Graph View is a major step on that path.
