I know it's been over a year since link:/blog/2023/03/30/android-and-jenkins/[the first article] of this series, but hey, life happens!
I've been juggling quite a few things that are more important for the Jenkins project.
Let's face it, nobody's losing sleep over running Jenkins on Android.
But hey, sometimes you just gotta indulge in a bit of tech whimsy, am I right?

So, here we are, diving back into this almost frivolous experiment to see just how far we can push the Jenkins-Android interaction.
There are essentially two ways to stretch the boundaries with Jenkins and Android:

. Building Android apps with Jenkins
. Running Jenkins on an Android device

Now, the first option has already had its moment in the spotlight in another series of articles, so we're turning our attention to the latter.
Why, you might ask?
Well, because why not? Because we're tech enthusiasts, and if there's a crazy idea floating around, we're going to give it a shot!

== Setting up Jenkins Controller on Android

In link:/blog/2023/03/30/android-and-jenkins/[the previous article], we already laid the groundwork for running a Jenkins agent on Android.
We installed link:https://wiki.termux.com/[Termux], link:https://www.openssh.com/[OpenSSH], and link:/blog/2023/03/30/android-and-jenkins/#installing-java-on-termux[Java] on the Android device, and confirmed that the agent could be reached from a grown-up Jenkins controller.
We even got it to run a FreeStyle pipeline that spat out the result of the `uname -a` command. +
Quite the achievement, huh?

For this experiment, we're sticking with my old Redmi Note 7, still chugging along with Android 10.
Now, keep in mind, this device got benched because it couldn't keep up with my daily pace, so it's not exactly a powerhouse for Jenkins.
Sure, I could've slapped Linux on it instead, but where's the fun in taking the easy route, right?
Let's see if we can kickstart a Jenkins controller on this bad boy!

=== Launching the controller via Java command.

Now, I've dabbled with memory-constrained devices before, and I know a Jenkins controller can work with a measly 1GB of RAM.
No clue how much of that sweet memory pie the Android system will serve up to Termux, or how much Termux will pass along to the JVM, but hey, let's roll the dice!
When I SSH in from my PC, here's what I see:

[source,bash]
----
~ $ free -h
               total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           3.6Gi       2.1Gi        80Mi       3.0Mi       1.5Gi       1.3Gi
Swap:          2.2Gi       1.6Gi       623Mi
----

Looks like we're sitting on a cozy 3.6GB of RAM, which should be just about enough to wrangle a Jenkins controller into submission.
Let's fire it up using the trusty jenkins.war file, the lazy dev's best friend! +
But first, a quick pit stop to grab the latest LTS version of Jenkins from link:https://get.jenkins.io/war-stable/latest/jenkins.war[here]. +
link:/download/#downloading-jenkins[The official documentation] says it's `2.440.3` at the time of writing, but, you know, details.

[source,bash]
----
pkg install curl
----
Now, with our newfound love for curl, let's snag that jenkins.war file:

[source,bash]
----
curl -L -O https://get.jenkins.io/war-stable/latest/jenkins.war
----

With the file safely in our grasp, it's showtime! Let's unleash Jenkins upon this unsuspecting Android device:

[source,bash]
----
java -jar jenkins.war
----

The familiar lines start flowing:

[source,bash]
----

image:/images/post-images/2024/04/18/security-issue.png[standard security warning,860]
Nothing to do with Termux, but we'll iron out the kinks later.

Quite the milestone, huh? +
We've proven that we can kickstart a Jenkins controller using Termux on an Android device. +
But hold onto your hats, folks!
We're not done just yet. +
Next up, we'll ensure this Jenkins controller can strut its stuff as a service, and then, we'll tweak it to kick off automatically at boot time.

=== What is a service, and why do we need it?

Now, we could just let Jenkins lurk in the shadows, but where's the fun in that?
What if Android decides to play the ultimate prank and terminate Termux, or the device throws a fit and decides to reboot?
We'd be stuck manually resurrecting Jenkins every single time, and that's just not the cricket we signed up for. +
So, let's give Jenkins a promotion, shall we? Time to turn it into a proper service!

The standard Jenkins installation link:/blog/2022/03/25/systemd-migration/[migrated] from `init` to `systemd` a while back.
Unfortunately, Termux isn't in on the `systemd` party, so we'll have to make do with the tools it offers. +
Enter link:https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Termux-services[termux-services], a handy collection of scripts for service wrangling. +
Instead of cluttering up `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`, we can now start and stop services with a flick of the wrist, thanks to termux-services. +
There's already a smorgasbord of existing services ready to roll, and just like with `systemd`, there's nothing stopping us from crafting a bespoke service for our beloved Jenkins.

To get termux-services up and running, execute:

[source,bash]
----
pkg install termux-services runit
service-daemon start
----
Then, give Termux a gentle nudge so that the service-daemon springs to life.

[source,bash]
----
exit
----

Next up, to unleash the power of a service, fire off:
[source,bash]
----
sv-enable <service>
----
If you're in the mood for a one-off joyride, a simple:
[source,bash]
----
sv up <service>
----
will suffice. +
And when it's time to hit the brakes, just tap into your inner traffic cop with:
[source,bash]
----
sv down <service>
----
Or, if you're feeling particularly ruthless, disable it altogether:
[source,bash]
----
sv-disable <service>
----
A service is like a restless spirit shackled to this mortal realm if `$PREFIX/var/service/<service>/down` exists, so the `sv-enable` and `sv-disable` scripts play a little game of touch-and-go with this file.

Under the hood, termux-services taps into the mighty link:http://smarden.org/runit/[runit] to reign in the chaos of services. +
You'll find a treasure trove of example scripts on the link:http://smarden.org/runit/runscripts.html[runit website]. +
If you spot a script you fancy, or if you're feeling particularly creative, just follow these steps:
[source,bash]
----
mkdir -p $PREFIX/var/service/<PKG>/log
ln -sf $PREFIX/share/termux-services/svlogger $PREFIX/var/service/<PKG>/log/run
----
Then, tuck your run script snugly into `$PREFIX/var/service/<PKG>/run`, making sure it's ready for its close-up.

With all the pieces in place, a swift:
and then put your run script for the package at `$PREFIX/var/service/<PKG>/run` and make sure that it is runnable.

You can then run
[source,bash]
----
sv up <PKG>
----
will breathe life into your creation.

The log files for these services bask in the limelight at `$PREFIX/var/log/sv/<PKG>/`, with the star of the show bearing the name "current".

=== Turning Jenkins into a Service for Smooth Sailing

Now that we've mastered the art of creating and deploying services with Termux, let's give our Jenkins controller a promotion. +
First up, we need to whip up a script to kickstart Jenkins as a service.
Let's call it `run` and tuck it snugly into the `$PREFIX/var/service/jenkins/` directory.

[source,bash]
----
mkdir -p $PREFIX/var/service/jenkins
cd $PREFIX/var/service/jenkins
cat >> run <<EOF
#!/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bash
JENKINS_LOG=/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.jenkins/logs/jenkins.log
/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/java -Djava.io.tmpdir=/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/tmp -jar /data/data/com.termux/files/home/jenkins.war --logfile=${JENKINS_LOG}
EOF
chmod +x run
mkdir -p /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.jenkins/logs
touch /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.jenkins/logs/jenkins.log
----

With our script ready, let's test if Jenkins plays nice as a service:
[source,bash]
----
sv-enable jenkins
sv up jenkins
----

Time to peek under the hood and see if Jenkins is revving up by checking the logs:
[source,bash]
----
tail -f $PREFIX/../home/.jenkins/logs/jenkins.log&
----

Voilà! Standard Jenkins logs, just like we're accustomed to seeing on a run-of-the-mill server.
[source,bash]

With Jenkins now up and about, you can access it at the port 8080 on your trusty Android device.

=== Ensuring Availability from Boot for Uninterrupted Service

We've hit two major milestones:

. Getting a Jenkins controller up and running on an Android device.
. Successfully running Jenkins as a service on the Android device whenever we fire up Termux.

Pretty cool, right? +
But what if the device decides to throw a curveball and reboots?
I know, this whole experiment is just a tech whimsy, but let's push the boundaries and see how far we can take it.
Frankly, even if I'm just treating this as a fun experiment, I'd rather not deal with the hassle of launching Termux every time I reboot the device. +
So, the logical next step?
Adding the Jenkins service to the roster of auto-starting services when the device boots up.

==== Installation of Termux:Boot

First things first, let's get our hands on the Termux:Boot add-on from link:https://f-droid.org/packages/com.termux.boot/[F-Droid].
Important note: Keep your installations of Termux and Add-ons strictly from one source, either Google Play or F-Droid.
Mixing them up can lead to compatibility issues due to different key-signing methods.

. Install the Termux:Boot app.
. Head over to your Android settings and give Termux and Termux:Boot the green light by turning off battery optimizations for these apps.
. Give the Termux:Boot app a friendly tap to start it up.
This ensures it gets the memo to kick into action at boot time.
. Ready for some directory magic?
Let's create the `~/.termux/boot/` directory: This is where you'll stash all the scripts you want to fire up on boot.
[source,bash]
----
mkdir ~/.termux/boot/
----
If you've got a bunch of scripts, fear not—they'll line up and execute in a nice, orderly fashion.
. Pro tip: Keep your device wide awake by running termux-wake-lock right off the bat.
For example, to kickstart an sshd server and keep your device bright-eyed and bushy-tailed at boot, craft a little script like this one at `~/.termux/boot/start-sshd`:
[source,bash]
----
#!/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/sh
termux-wake-lock
sshd
----
Don't you forget to make it executable:
[source,bash]
----
chmod 755 ~/.termux/boot/start-sshd
----
And if you're itching to have Termux-services do their thing at boot time, simply throw in:
[source,bash]
----
#!/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/sh
termux-wake-lock
. $PREFIX/etc/profile
----
This nifty snippet will unleash all the services that are raring to go in termux-services.

==== Adding Jenkins to the list of services that start automatically

Now, let's add Jenkins to the list of services that start automatically when the device boots up.
Craft a script named `~/.termux/boot/start-jenkins` and give it the following content:
[source,bash]
----
#!/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/sh
termux-wake-lock
sv up jenkins
----

And there you have it!
Jenkins is now part of the elite club of services that kick off automatically when the device boots up.
Now, you can rest easy knowing that your Jenkins controller will be up and running, ready to tackle any task you throw its way.

==== Checking Jenkins' Boot-up Performance

To ensure that Jenkins is indeed strutting its stuff when the device boots up, let's put it to the test—give that device a good old reboot. +
But before you hit that restart button, make sure you've given termux-boot a hearty handshake at least once and sorted out all the necessary permissions. +
That means letting it run in the background and disabling battery optimization.
And if you're rocking a phone with MIUI, well, hold onto your hats—you might need to do a little extra dance to get things grooving smoothly. +
Head on over to the settings, and summon the magic word "background".
Hunt down an item called "Background autostart" and flip the switch for termux-boot and termux. +
Et voilà! You've just unleashed the boot-time prowess of termux on MIUI.

== Adding a Jenkins Agent on Android

So, Jenkins on Android is strutting its stuff, but it's throwing a fit about missing its sidekick, the agent.
Can't have Jenkins sulking; let's get that agent up and running on Android, shall we?
image:/images/post-images/2024/04/18/jenkins-complaining.png[Jenkins complaining about the absence of an agent,860]

=== Establishing SSH connection for agent integration.

Remember when we link:/blog/2023/03/30/android-and-jenkins/#setting-up-public-key-authentication[conjured up an SSH key pair] for our Android device?
Well, we're going to do it again for the agent.
Time to add the public key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file on the Android device. +
Get ready to unleash some command-line magic:
[source,bash]
----
~ $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "jenkins-agent"
Enter file in which to save the key (/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.ssh/id_rsa
Your public key has been saved in /data/data/com.termux/files/home/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:rpaD/RohRXJsXAYTOahQWpIsih9vhzgl7G9PO23MujI jenkins-agent

----
To add the generated public key to the authorized keys file, we can use the `cat` command to append the public key to the `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.
Here's how we can do it:
[source,bash]
----
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
----
This command will add the contents of the `id_rsa.pub` file (which is our public key) to the `authorized_keys` file.
If the `authorized_keys` file doesn't exist, no worries – it'll be conjured into existence for us. +

Now, before we get too carried away with our newfound access, let's ensure our digital fortress is properly fortified.
The `~/.ssh` directory should flaunt permissions worthy of a royal decree: `700 (drwx------)`.
Meanwhile, the authorized_keys file should be wrapped in the impenetrable cloak of `600 (-rw-------)` permissions.

If you're feeling particularly wizardly, you can set these permissions using the `chmod` command:
[source,bash]
----
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
----
Let's infuse this with a touch of levity:

If you're still getting the password runaround when attempting to connect, there's a chance our SSH server isn't keen on our public key party trick. +
Time to play detective!
Navigate to the `$PREFIX/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file and make sure it hasn't ghosted us.
Look for a line that reads like the magic incantation we need:
[source,bash]
----
PubkeyAuthentication yes
----
If you've been tinkering with the `sshd_config` file, don't forget to give the SSH service a friendly nudge to let it know about the changes.
Now that we've got the key to the kingdom, it's time to set up a VIP pass for Jenkins.

Take a stroll over to the Jenkins controller and swing by "Manage Jenkins" > "Credentials" > "System".
Next, hover over "Global credentials (unrestricted)" like a champ, click the down arrow, and select "Add Credentials".

Now, choose "SSH Username with private key" as the type of credential, and let's fill in the deets:

. Username: <your termux user name>
. Private Key: Enter directly, and paste the content of the private key file `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.
. Passphrase: Leave it empty.
. ID: jenkins-agent
. Description: Jenkins Agent SSH Key

Voilà!
You should now be the proud owner of a brand spanking new credential named "jenkins-agent".
Jenkins is now armed with this secret handshake to chat with the Android device (which, let's be honest, is basically chatting with itself).

=== Configuring the agent to communicate with the controller.

Alright, back in the driver's seat at "Manage Jenkins", let's give that shiny blue "Set up agent" button a good ol' click and dive into the adventure!

image:/images/post-images/2024/04/18/jenkins-complaining.png[Jenkins complaining about the absence of an agent,860]

Time to give our agent a name – I went with "Myself" because, well, it's cozy in here with the Android machine.
Select "Permanent Agent" as the mode.
image:/images/post-images/2024/04/18/set-up-agent.png[Jenkins asking to set up an agent,860]

Now, hit "Save". You should now see a gazillion fields to fill in.
For the description, I went with something like "The smartphone itself" because, why not?
For the number of executors, I settled on `1`, but feel free to tweak it based on your machine's prowess. +
The remote root directory is set to `/data/data/com.termux/files/home` – that's our agent's humble abode, the Termux user's home turf.

As for labels, I went with "aarch64, android" – gotta give our Android buddy some identity, right?
And for usage, let's go with "Use this node as much as possible" – it's eager to help!

Now, for the grand finale, choose "Launch agent via SSH" as the launch method. +
Host? +
Oh, just good ol' localhost, and for credentials, select our trusty "jenkins-agent" from earlier.

Oh, but wait!
Before we click that final "Save" button, we're diving into the "Advanced" settings because, well, we're adventurers!
Change the port to `8022` and don't forget to update the "JavaPath" to `/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/java`.

Lastly, sprinkle in some digits – "60" for "Connection Timeout in Seconds", "10" for "Maximum Number of Retries", and "10" for "Seconds To Wait Between Retries".

Then, with a dramatic flourish, click "Save" and let the magic unfold!

After a bit of anticipation, give that "Log" button a tap and voilà!
You should see something like this:
[source,bash]
----
Remoting version: 3206.vb_15dcf73f6a_9
Launcher: SSHLauncher
Communication Protocol: Standard in/out
This is a Unix agent
Agent successfully connected and online
----

image:/images/post-images/2024/04/18/agent-connected.png[Jenkins agent connected,860]
As you can see, the agent is connected, despite being on the same machine as the controller and running on top of Android. +
Now, you can use this agent to run your builds on the Android device itself.
But... there is still a problem with our configuration and we have some ameliorations to make. +
On the top right, you can still see a red warning: "Building on the built-in node can be a security issue. You should set the number of executors on the built-in node to 0.".
We'll have to address this issue.

=== Cleaning up the configuration

Alright, time to tackle that pesky security issue!
Hop on over to "_Manage Jenkins_" > "_Nodes_", and give a friendly click on "_Built-in Node_". +
Once there, mosey on over to the left and hit up "_Configure_". Now, set the number of executors to a solid `0`.
Then, seal the deal with a satisfying click on "_Save_". +
Voilà! Watch that red warning vanish into thin air like it's pulling a magic act!
image:/images/post-images/2024/04/18/no-more-warning.png[No more warning about the built-in node,860]
We've officially squashed that security bug and are all set to strut our stuff with our agent, free from any worries.

== Creating a Pipeline from GitHub Repo

In the rest of this tutorial, we’ll treat Jenkins like our trusty (and slightly grumpy) butler.
We’re going to create a new Jenkins pipeline job (either via the classic UI or with a Jenkinsfile in Git) and then hook it up to a GitHub repository.
The result: every time you push code, Jenkins will grab it and run your build.


=== Installing the necessary prerequisites

[source,shell]
----
pkg install libmpfr
pkg install git
pkg install make
----

=== Setting Up the Jenkins Pipeline
First, let’s make Jenkins do our bidding.
On the Jenkins dashboard, click _New Item_, give the job a name (e.g. `my-awesome-pipeline`), and choose _Pipeline_ as the project type.
Click _OK_ and scroll to the _Pipeline_ section of the configuration.
Here you have two main options: _define the pipeline script inline_, or _pull it from source control_.

=== Option 1: Inline (Scripted) Pipeline
If you want to experiment quickly, select _Pipeline script_ in the Definition dropdown.
You can then paste Groovy code into the Script box. For example, Jenkins documentation gives this minimal _Declarative_ pipeline

[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Hello') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello from Jenkins!'
            }
        }
    }
}
----

This tiny pipeline just prints a message, but you can expand it with actual build steps (compile, test, etc.) as needed.
When you’ve entered your script, click *Save*, then *Build Now* to see Jenkins run your new pipeline (check *Console Output* to watch the magic).
image:/images/post-images/2024/04/18/first-console-output.png[first Jenkins output console,860]

=== Option 2: Jenkinsfile (Pipeline from SCM)

For real projects, it’s best to store your pipeline definition in source control.
Create a `Jenkinsfile` in your GitHub repo (at the root by default) containing your pipeline code (like the example above).
Then, in the same *Pipeline* section, switch the Definition to *Pipeline script from SCM*.
Select *Git* as the SCM and enter your GitHub repository URL.
If your repo is private, you’ll also need to supply credentials here (more on that below).
Finally, set the *Script Path* to the path of your `Jenkinsfile` (the default `Jenkinsfile` at repo root is usually fine)
Save this job.
Now Jenkins will clone your GitHub repo and run the pipeline defined in the `Jenkinsfile` whenever it builds.

== Linking the Pipeline to GitHub

Now that we have a pipeline job, let’s hook it up so that GitHub can kick off builds automatically.

* *Install GitHub plugins:* First, ensure Jenkins can talk to GitHub.
In _Manage Jenkins → Manage Plugins_, confirm you have the GitHub Integration plugin (it often comes pre-installed).
If not, install it.
This plugin provides the “GitHub hook trigger” and other useful bells and whistles.
* *Add GitHub credentials:* Go to *Manage Jenkins → Manage Credentials*, choose Global, and click *Add Credentials*. Use:
** `Username with password` (GitHub username + PAT)
** or `SSH Username with private key` if preferred
* *Configure the pipeline job:* Set repo URL and credentials in *Pipeline script from SCM*. Under *Build Triggers*, check `GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling`.
* *Set up the webhook in GitHub:*
** Go to *Settings → Webhooks*
** Payload URL: `http://your-jenkins-server/github-webhook/`
** Content type: `application/json`
** Events: push and/or pull requests
** Click *Add webhook*

TIP: If Jenkins is not publicly accessible (e.g. running locally), you can test with `ngrok` or trigger builds manually.

== Reflecting on Our Pipeline Journey

Well done, adventurer! Your Jenkins pipeline is now alive and kicking. Jenkins is basically your sidekick – monitoring your GitHub repo and automatically building whenever you push.

Jenkins has turned from a grumpy butler into a superhero for your code. You might not hear applause, but trust us, you’re silently being hero-worshipped by your future self every time you see a green build light.

== Onward to the Next Adventure…

If you thought hooking Jenkins to GitHub was fun, just wait for the next chapter. Maybe next time we’ll teach Jenkins to deploy itself to Mars, or hook your code pipeline to a coffee machine. Will Jenkins learn kung-fu? Will it discover an existential love for YAML?
