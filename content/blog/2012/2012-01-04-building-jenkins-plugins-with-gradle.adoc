Until now, Jenkins plugins written in Java or Groovy could only be built with Maven, using the maven-hpi-plugin to generate a proper manifest and archive which Jenkins can consume. But starting now, you can also use https://gradle.org[Gradle]!

See https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Gradle+JPI+Plugin[the wiki] for information on how you can use Gradle and the new gradle-jpi-plugin to build, test and release your Java or Groovy Jenkins plugin.
