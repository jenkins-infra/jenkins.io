<a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco.cb">Jenkins User Conference 2012 San Francisco</a> is this weekend!<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Based on the experience from the last year, we are going to make a reservation for a dinner after JUC. If you are interested in joining us, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/84235932/">please RSVP</a>. We haven't decided where to go, but we'll place a reservation somewhere (and if you know a good place to go, please tell us, too!), so that we won't have to spend 30 minutes on the street looking for a place for a crowd.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Eating is more fun when there are more people. Please join us!
