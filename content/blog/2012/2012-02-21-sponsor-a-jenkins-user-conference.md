With the [JUC Paris 2012](/content/jenkins-user-conference-2012-paris) call for papers open, it's important to mention that we are also looking for **sponsors** for the various Jenkins User Conferences that are being planned around the world right now!

Currently there are four conferences being put together right now:

* [JUC Paris](https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-paris.cb)
* [JUC New York](https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-newyork.cb)
* [JUC San Francisco](https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco.cb)
* [JUC Antwerp](https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-antwerp.cb)

If your company is heavily invested in Jenkins or interested in reaching the kind of audience that will be at a JUC (highly technical, motivated) then you should consider becoming a sponsor one of these conferences (link below)!
