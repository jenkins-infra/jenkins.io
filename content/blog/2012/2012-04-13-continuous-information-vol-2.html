If you fit that category, and if you want to stay on top of the latest happenings in Jenkins, don’t miss Volume 2 of <a href="https://pages.cloudbees.com/index.php/email/emailWebview?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRow5%2FmYJoDpwmWGd5mht7VzDtPj1OY6hBksIr%2BJK1TtuMFUGpsqOOqSDhcUEZVk0w%3D%3D">Continuous Information, the CloudBees Newsletter for Jenkins</a>.<br/>
<br/>
