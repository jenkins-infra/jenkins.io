https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco.cb[Jenkins User Conference 2012 San Francisco] is this weekend! +

Based on the experience from the last year, we are going to make a reservation for a dinner after JUC. If you are interested in joining us, https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/84235932/[please RSVP]. We haven't decided where to go, but we'll place a reservation somewhere (and if you know a good place to go, please tell us, too!), so that we won't have to spend 30 minutes on the street looking for a place for a crowd. +

Eating is more fun when there are more people. Please join us!
