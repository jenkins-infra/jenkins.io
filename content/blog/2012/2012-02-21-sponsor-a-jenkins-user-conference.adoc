With the link:/content/jenkins-user-conference-2012-paris[JUC Paris 2012] call for papers open, it's important to mention that we are also looking for *sponsors* for the various Jenkins User Conferences that are being planned around the world right now!

Currently there are four conferences being put together right now:

* https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-paris.cb[JUC Paris]
* https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-newyork.cb[JUC New York]
* https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco.cb[JUC San Francisco]
* https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-antwerp.cb[JUC Antwerp]

If your company is heavily invested in Jenkins or interested in reaching the kind of audience that will be at a JUC (highly technical, motivated) then you should consider becoming a sponsor one of these conferences (link below)!
