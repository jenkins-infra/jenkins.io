For years, we've been hearing about *covert* installations of Jenkins by groups
of developers within larger companies. Rogue engineers, frustrated by the lack
of continuous integration would download `jenkins.war` and run it off their
workstation. As time went on, word-of-mouth within the organization spread
Jenkins far and wide.

Today we announce an initiative to help support these rogue agents: the
[Jenkins CIA](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+CIA+Program). CIA being short for Continuous
Integration Ambassador of course.


If you're going to be speaking at a JUG or another event where you will have
the opportunity to promote and teach people about Jenkins, you too can join the
CIA:

* Send us an email telling us about the event and how many people you expect
* Write us a guest blog post ahead of time, talking about the event
* We dispatch Jenkins stickers and a CIA Agent shirt for you to wear.
* Write up a summary blog post about the event afterwards
* Repeat!

In the coming months, we'll start collaborating and creating standard
presentations that can be easily re-used to introduce people not only to
Jenkins, but continuous integration in general, so stay tuned.


If you're not the speaking type but instead prefer to work behind the scenes,
you can join the [OSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Strategic_Services) by checking out the [Beginner's Guide to contributing
to Jenkins](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Beginners+Guide+to+Contributing).
