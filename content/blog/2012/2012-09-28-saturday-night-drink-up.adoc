Because https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/84235932/[the dinner looks popular], here's another last minute gathering for https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco.cb[JUC San Francisco]. +
 +

 +
We'll have a small drink-up Saturday night at http://21st-amendment.com/[21st Amendment] (563 2nd Street), like from 6pm to whenever. If you are coming from out of town, you probably are around, so why not join us! +
 +

At least abayer, majost, and kohsuke should be there, and hopefully more. If you are coming, please leave a comment in this post so that we get the sense of who to expect!
