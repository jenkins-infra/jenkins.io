This is a guest post by

one of the Jenkins Organization Admins in Google Summer of Code.
====

On behalf of the GSoC org team I am happy to announce that we are going to apply to 
link:https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/[Google Summer of Code (GSoC) on this year]. 
GSoC presumes that high-profile students work in open-source projects for several months under mentorship of organization members.

We are looking for mentors and project ideas. 
So yes, we are looking for you :)

== Conditions

* Mentors lead the project in the area of their interest
* Mentors actively participate in the project during student selection, community bonding and coding phases (March - August)
* Mentors work in teams of 2+ mentors per 1 each student
* Mentors dedicate a consistent and significant amount of time, especially during the coding phase (_~5 hours_ per week in the team of two mentors)

Mentorship does not require strong expertise in Jenkins plugin development. 
The main objective is to guide students and to get them involved into the Jenkins community. 
If your mentor team requires any specific expertise, org admins will do their best in order to find advisors.

== What do you get?

* A student, who works within the area of your interest on full-time for several months
* Joint projects with Jenkins experts, lots of fun and ability to study something together
* Limited edition of swags from Google and Jenkins project
* Maybe: Participation in GSoC Mentor Summit in California with expense coverage (depends on project results and per-project quotas)

== Requirements

* You are passionate about Jenkins
* You are interested in being mentor or advisor
* Your project idea should be about Jenkins (plugins, core, infrastructure, etc.)
* Your project idea should be about code
* Your project idea should be potentially doable in 3-4 months
* You are ready to dedicate time && have no major unavailability periods planned to this summer 

== If you are interested

In such case drop the Email to the Jenkins Developer mailing list with the _GSoC2017_ prefix.

* Briefly describe your project idea (a couple of sentences) and required qualifications from students. Examples: link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Google+Summer+Of+Code+2016#GoogleSummerOfCode2016-Projectideas[GSoC2016], link:/projects/gsoc[GSoC2017 - current project ideas]
* If you already have a co-mentor, please mention him
* Having several project ideas is fine. Having no specific ideas is also fine.

Disclaimer: We cannot guarantee that all projects happen, it depends on student application results and the number of project slots.
