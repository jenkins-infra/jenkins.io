=== Promises

Today I'm going to show you best practices to write scalable and robust Jenkins pipelines. This is drawn from a
combination of work with the internals of Pipeline and observations with large-scale users.

Pipeline code works beautifully for its intended role of orchestrating
build/test/deploy/administer cycles.  As it is pressed into more complex roles and unanticipated uses, some users hit issues.
In these cases, applying the best practices can make the difference between:

* A single master running
https://www.cloudbees.com/so-you-want-build-worlds-biggest-jenkins-cluster[hundreds
of concurrent builds] on low end hardware (4 CPU cores and 4 GB of
heap)
* Running a couple dozen builds and bringing a master to its knees or
crashing it...even with 16+ CPU cores and 20+ GB of heap!

This has been seen in the wild.

Fundamentals
------------

To understand pipeline behavior you must understand a few points about
how it executes.

1.  All of the pipeline logic except for steps runs on the master (the
Groovy). Whether simple _or_ complex! Even inside a `node` block!
2.  _Steps_ may use executors to do work where appropriate, but each
step has a small on-master overhead too.
3.  Pipeline code is written as Groovy but the execution model is
radically transformed at compile-time to Continuation Passing Style
(CPS).
4.  This transformation provides valuable safety and durability
guarantees for pipelines, but it comes with trade-offs:
    ..  Steps can invoke Java and execute fast and efficiently, but Groovy
is _much_ slower to run than normal.
    ..  Groovy logic requires far more memory, because an object-based
syntax/block tree is kept in memory. +
5.  Pipelines persist the program and its state frequently to be able to
survive failure of the master.

From these we arrive at a set of best practices to make pipelines more
effective.

Best Practices For Pipeline Code
--------------------------------

. *Think of pipeline code as glue:* just enough Groovy code to connect
together the pipeline steps and integrate tools, and no more.
..   This makes code easier to maintain, more robust against bugs, and
reduces load on masters.
.  *Keep it simple:* limit the amount of complex logic embedded in the
pipeline itself (similarly to a shell script) and avoid treating it as a
general-purpose programming language.
..    Pipeline restricts all variables to `Serializable` types, so keeping
pipeline logic simple helps avoid a `NotSerializableException` - see
appendix at the bottom.
.  *USE trusted global libraries `@NonCPS`-annotated functions for slightly more complex work.*
This means more involved processing, logic, and transformations. This
lets you leverage additional Groovy & functional features for more
powerful, concise, and performant code.
..    This still runs on masters so be mindful of complexity, but is much
faster than native pipeline code because it doesn’t provide durability
and uses a faster execution model. Still, be mindful of the CPU cost and
offload to executors for complex work (see below).
..  NonCPS functions can use a much broader subset of the Groovy
language, such as iterators and functional features (which makes them
more terse and fast to write).
    ..  @NonCPS functions should not use pipeline steps internally, however
you can store the result of a pipeline step to a variable and use it
that as the input to a NonCPS function.
    ... *Gotcha:* It’s not guaranteed that use of a step will generate an
error (there is an open RFE to implement that), but you should not rely
on that behavior. You may see improper handling of exceptions, in
particular.
    ..  While normal pipeline is restricted to serializable local variables
(see appendix at bottom), @NonCPS functions can use more complex,
nonserializable types internally (e.g. regex matchers, etc). Parameters
and return types should still be Serializable, however.
    ... *Gotcha:* improper usages are not guaranteed to raise an error with
normal pipeline (optimizations may mask the issue), but it is unsafe to
rely on this behavior.
.  *Prefer external scripts/tools for complex or CPU-expensive
processing* rather than Groovy language features. This offloads work
from the master to external executors, allowing for easy scale-out of
hardware resources. It is also generally easier to test because these
components can be tested in isolation without the full on-master
execution environment.
    ..  Many software vendors will provide easy command-line clients for
their tools in various programming languages. These are often robust,
performant, and easy to use. Plugins offer another option (see below).
    ..  Shell or batch steps are often the easiest way to integrate these
tools, which can be written in any language. For example: `sh “java -jar
client.jar $endPointUrl $inputData”` for a Java client, or `sh “python
jiraClient.py $issueId $someParam”` for a Python client. +
    ..  Examples of places to use this:
        ...  XML/JSON parsing and transformation (ex: xmllint or xmlstarlet for XML
xpath, jq for JSON) - this can be coupled to curl or wget for HTTP requests
        ...  Templating large files
        ...  Nontrivial integration with external APIs (for bigger vendors,
consider a Jenkins plugin if a quality offering exists)
        ...  Simulations/complex calculations
        ...  Business logic
.  *Consider existing plugins for external integrations.* Jenkins has a
wealth of plugins, especially for source control, artifact management,
deployment systems, and systems automation. These can greatly reduce the
amount of pipeline code to maintain. Well-written plugins may be
faster and more robust than pipeline equivalents.
    ..  Consider both plugins and command-line clients (above) -- one may be
easier than the other.
    ..  Plugins may be of widely varying quality. Vendor-maintained plugins
with a large install base are often of good quality. Third-party plugins
with limited installations may actually be worse than writing a little
custom pipeline code.
    ..  As a last resort, if there is a good-quality plugin that is not
pipeline-enabled, it is fairly easy to write a pipeline wrapper to
integrate it or write a custom step that will invoke it.
.  *Assume things will go wrong:* don’t rely on workspaces being clean
of the remnants from previous executions, clean explicitly where needed.
Make use of timeouts and retry steps (that’s what they’re there for).
    ..  Within a git repository, ‘git clean -fdx’ is a good way to
accomplish this and reduces the amount of SCM cloning
.  *DO use parameterized pipelines and variables to make your pipeline
scripts more reusable.* Passing in parameters is especially helpful for
handling different environments and should be preferred to applying
conditional lookup logic.
.  *Try to limit business logic embedded in pipelines.* To some extent
this is inevitable, but try to focus on tasks to complete instead,
because this yields more maintainable, reusable, and often more
performant pipeline code.
    ..  One code smell that points to a problem is many hard-coded
constants. Consider taking advantage of the options above to refactor
code for better composability.
    ..  For complex cases, consider using Jenkins integration options
(plugins, Jenkins API calls, invoking input steps externally) to offload
implementation of more complex business rules to an external system if
they fit more naturally there.

Please, think of these as guidelines, not strict rules – Jenkins
pipeline provides a great deal of power and flexibility, and it's there
to be used.

Breaking enough of these rules at scale can cause masters to fail by
placing an unsustainable load on them.

For additional guidance, we also recommend the Jenkins World talk on how
to engineer pipelines for speed and performance:

[[appendix-serializable-vs.-non-serializable-types]]
Appendix: Serializable vs. Non-Serializable Types:
--------------------------------------------------

To assist with pipeline development, here are common serializable and
non-serializable types, to assist with deciding if your logic can be CPS
or should be in a @NonCPS function to avoid issues.

*Common Serializable Types (safe everywhere):*

.  All primitive types and their object wrappers: byte, boolean, int,
double, short, char
.  Strings
.  enums
.  Arrays of serializable types
.  ArrayLists and normal Groovy Lists
.  Sets: HashSet
.  Maps: normal Groovy Map, HashMap, TreeMap
.  Exceptions
.  URLs
. Dates
. Regex Patterns (compiled patterns)

*Common non-Serializable Types (only safe in @NonCPS functions):*

. Iterators: this is a common problem. You need to use C-style loop, i.e.
`for(int i=0; i<max; i++){`
. Regex Matchers (you can use the
built-in functions in String, etc, just not the Matcher itself)
. *Important:* JsonObject, JsonSlurper, etc in Groovy 2+ (used in some 2.x+
versions of Jenkins).
..  This is due to an internal implementation change
-- earlier versions may serialize.
