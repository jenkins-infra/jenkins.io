Multiple Jenkins plugins received updates today that fix several security vulnerabilities.

* plugin:uno-choice[Active Choices] (uno-choice)
* plugin:build-publisher[Build-Publisher]
* plugin:depgraph-view[Dependency Graph Viewer]
* plugin:global-build-stats[global-build-stats]

Additionally, the plugin:jenkins-multijob-plugin[Multijob Plugin] also received a security update several weeks ago.

For an overview of these security fixes, see the link:/security/advisory/2017-10-23[security advisory].

Active Choices Plugin distribution had been suspended since April due to its mandatory dependency on the suspended Scriptler Plugin.
That dependency has been made optional, so Active Choices can be used without having Scriptler installed.
This means we are able to resume distribution of Active Choices Plugin again.
It should be available on update sites later today.

We also announced a medium severity security vulnerability in SCP publisher plugin that does not have a fix at this time.
