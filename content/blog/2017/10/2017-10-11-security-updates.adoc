We just released security updates to Jenkins, versions 2.84 and 2.73.2, that fix several security vulnerabilities.
Additionally, we published a new release of Swarm Plugin whose client contains a security fix, and Maven Plugin 3.0 was recently released to resolve a security issue.
Users of Swarm Plugin and Maven Plugin should update these to their respective newest versions.

For an overview of what was fixed, see the link:/security/advisory/2017-10-11[security advisory].
For an overview on the possible impact of these changes on upgrading Jenkins LTS, see our link:/doc/upgrade-guide/2.73/#upgrading-to-jenkins-lts-2-73-2[LTS upgrade guide].

We also published information about a vulnerability in Speaks! Plugin.
There is no fix available and we recommend it be uninstalled.
Its distribution has been suspended.
