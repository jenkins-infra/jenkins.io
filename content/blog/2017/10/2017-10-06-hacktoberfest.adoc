### How do I label issues and pull requests?

Hacktoberfest project requires issues and/or pull requests to be labeled with the `hacktoberfest` label.
You may have no permissions to set labels on your own, but do not worry!
Just mention `@jenkinsci/hacktoberfest` or `@jenkins-infra/hacktoberfest` in the repository,
and we will set the labels for you.

### How do I get reviews?

All examples above are being monitored by the Jenkins contributors,
and you will likely get a review within few days.
Reviews in other repositories and plugins may take longer.
In the case of delays, ping `@jenkinsci/code-reviewers` in your pull request
