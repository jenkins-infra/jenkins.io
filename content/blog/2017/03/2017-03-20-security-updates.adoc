Multiple Jenkins plugins received updates today that fix several security vulnerabilities:

* plugin:active-directory[Active Directory]
* plugin:distfork[Distributed Fork]
* plugin:email-ext[Email Extension (Email-ext)]
* plugin:mailer[Mailer]
* plugin:ssh-slaves[SSH Build Agents]

For an overview of what was fixed, see the link:/security/advisory/2017-03-20[security advisory].

Additionally, we also published a security notice for the following plugin and recommend that users disable and uninstall it:

* link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Classpath+Step+Plugin[Pipeline: Classpath Step]

This plugin is not part of the Pipeline suite of plugins, despite its name. It's installed on just several hundred instances.
