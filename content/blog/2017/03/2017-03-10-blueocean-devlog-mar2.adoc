We're counting down the weeks until link:/projects/blueocean[Blue Ocean] 1.0.
This week was one of continuing consolidation and polish. We also released b25
(beta #25), a collectors edition. The next version we will likely release will
be a release candidate (RC). The b25 release however contained a number of
fixes and features, such as branch filtering.

Some other updates of note from this past week:

- Updated a bunch of dependencies around Pipeline and fixed a whole lot
  of long standing bugs.
- Some work went on to make acceptance tests run on varied browsers via

- The Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor had its

  merged to master branch.  It won't be released to the Update Center until the
  next Blue Ocean release, there are a few more things to iron out.
- As the Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor is now considered to be part of Blue Ocean
  now, more people are kicking the tires, and starting to

  fixes to improve it]!
- The swishy "Blue Ocean" logo is gone, Jenkins branding is back (mixed feelings!)
- Fixes for concurrent users of input
- Fixes for handling errors around favoriting of Pipelines and more.
- Speeding up creation of Multibranch Pipelines via the new "Creation" flow.



And of course, a nice pretty screenshot of editing and saving a Multibranch
Pipeline with the Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor:

Up next for the Blue Ocean project:

* More consolidation and polish.
* A first release candidate out the door (!)
* New, sleeker, favorite card design, possibly a table design too.

Also note that there are changelogs maintained and visible on the

Enjoy!
