Last fall, prior to Jenkins World, CloudBees conducted a
link:/blog/2016/09/09/take-the-2016-jenkins-survey-blog/[Community Survey].
We received over *1200* responses, and thanks to this input, we have some
interesting insights into how Jenkins users and their use of Jenkins are
evolving.

Based on the survey's results, Jenkins is increasingly being used to support
continuous delivery (CD). Adoption of Jenkins 2, which featured "Pipeline as code" and
encouraged users to adopt link:/doc/book/pipeline[Jenkins Pipeline], has
skyrocketed to more than half of all Jenkins installations.  Other data
remained consistent with findings year-to-year, for example, the number of
Jenkins users continues to increase and 90% of survey respondents still
consider Jenkins mission-critical.

Here are some of the key findings:

* 85% of respondants indicated that Jenkins usage had increased
* 30% of organizations with more than 50 software projects used Jenkins in 2016 as compared to 16% in 2015
* An impressive 46% of respondents were running Jenkins 2.x, eight months after
  its release.
* Adoption of link:/doc/book/pipeline[Jenkins Pipeline] for continuous delivery
  (CD) is accelerating, 54% of respondents who have adopted CD are using Pipeline.
* 61% of respondents are deploying changes to production at least once per week
* Linux is the platform of choice for builds, favored by 85% of respondents
* 85% of respondants use Git as the source code repository
* Half of respondents are deploying applications directly to the cloud, with Amazon Web Services as the favored platform

We want to thank everyone for completing the survey, and congratulations to

We're looking forward to creating a 2017 Community Survey later this year and
hearing more from users at Jenkins World 2017 in San Francisco, we hope to
