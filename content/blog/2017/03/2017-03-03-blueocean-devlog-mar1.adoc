We're counting down the weeks until link:/projects/blueocean[Blue Ocean] 1.0.
This week was relatively quiet with a few people away for a few days, and
mostly about consolidation. There was a beta late last week, so this week we
thought we would let people have a rest from the upgrade treadmill for once.


One notable feature that has recently landed is "escaping to Classic" When you
see the exit symbol (door with arrow) it will take you to an equivalent page in
classic Jenkins (if one exists). You will notice this in a few places in the
app now.

Some other things that made it to `master` branch which have not yet been
released in a beta:

* An API to save/branch to GitHub was finished, and tested with "round
  tripping" with the Editor in some form
* New compact form of duration reporting (old style was too verbose for
  most screens)
* Fixed a bug with input submissions with concurrent browser sessions which was
  quite a tricky bug to chase down!
* Only show Admin link when appropriate.
* Many many bug fixes and polishing.

There has also been an uptick in activity on the
link:https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#jenkinsci_blueocean-plugin:gitter.im[Gitter channel] with an
increased number of questions about usage and Pipelines. But also questions
from people starting to extend, or add features, to Blue Ocean, which is very
nice to see.

link:https://github.com/halkeye[Gavin Mogan] has been looking at integrating
the plugin:sauce-ondemand[Sauce OnDemand] plugin into Blue Ocean for better
browser-test reporting. Tangentially related, we also are planning to improve
browser-testing in Blue Ocean as well. What is perhaps more exciting is that
more people, like link:https://github.com/dragoonis[Paul Dragoonis] and
link:https://github.com/m4dc4p[other folks], are starting to contribute some
fixes which have been lingering around for a while.

Up Next:

* Round trip Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor changes with load/save
* Bundling the Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor with the "aggregator" Blue Ocean
  plugin.
* Some release candidates!


Enjoy!
