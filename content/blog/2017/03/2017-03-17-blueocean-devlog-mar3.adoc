We're counting down the weeks until link:/projects/blueocean[Blue Ocean] 1.0,
and we're getting close!  In this past week, the first **release candidate**
has gone out to the Update Center, along with a new
plugin:blueocean-pipeline-editor[Pipeline Editor plugin]. The Blue Ocean
Pipeline Editor is its own plugin which integrates into Blue Ocean, so this was
a coordinated release with Blue Ocean 1.0 rc1.

Noteworthy this week:

* RC1 includes the Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor, which is integrates support for
  branch editing and saving the Pipeline back to GitHub (also referred to as
  "round-tripping").
* Many dependencies have been upgraded
* Per-stage raw logs can be downloaded, this will be included in the next
  release.
* Editor design improvements
* Fixes for overflowing text
* The new sleeker favorite card design has been released, so you can fit
  more favorites on your screen!

The Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor is better integrated into a few different
screens in Blue Ocean. For example, you can open the editor from the results
screen (top right):

Or open the editor from branch listings:
