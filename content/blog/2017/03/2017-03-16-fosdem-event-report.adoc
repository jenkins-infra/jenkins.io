In early February numerous free and open source developers from around the
world traveled to Brussels, Belgium, for arguably the largest event of its
kind:

were a dozen or so Jenkins contributors. We have attended the event in the
past, but this year we had a blizzard of activity spanning four days around the FOSDEM
weekend.

One of our "accidental traditions" has become a

the Friday night before FOSDEM truly begins at Cafe Le Roy d'Espagne on Grand
Place right in the middle of Brussels. Conveniently located a few hundred meters away from the
link:https://fosdem.org/2017/beerevent/[FOSDEM Beer Event]
at Delirium Cafe, each year we are inevitably joined by friends from other open
source projects who know they're welcome to join us for a few drinks.

After dinner and drinks, a few of us decided it would be a good idea (it
wasn't) to walk over to check out the FOSDEM Beer Event and _maybe_ have just
one more beer. For the uninitiated, Belgian beers tend to be strong, as the FOSDEM organizers warn:

Unlike some other beers, Belgian beer is not just coloured water. Some beers
contain significant quantities of alcohol and will give you a pounding
hangover.

Unfortunately, some of us seem to re-learn this lesson each year at FOSDEM!

Bright and early the following day, FOSDEM really kicked off with keynotes and
the project tables lining a number of corridors.

At the Jenkins project's table we typically spend two full days answering questions,
showing off the latest and greatest Jenkins features, and of course handing out
Jenkins stickers. The table is where many contributors, myself included, have
a rare opportunity to talk with dozens of enthusiastic Jenkins users from
across the broader open source community. This year we were very fortunate to have a
tremendous number of contributors available at the table to answer hundreds of
questions throughout the two days of FOSDEM.

I would like to thank everybody by name, but the entire weekend was such a blur
that I'm not sure I would be able to remember everybody who helped! We couldn't have
had a successful event without their support, so many thanks to all the
contributors who helped!

In addition to the Jenkins project table, we had two contributors present in
the
link:https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/track/testing_and_automation/[Testing and Automation]
devroom, which I helped organize in between answering Jenkins questions.

==== Declarative Pipelines in Jenkins

The first presentation was a stellar introduction to
link:/doc/book/pipeline[Declarative Pipelines]
in Jenkins, by long-time contributor and primary developer of Declarative
Pipeline support,

==== Using Containers for Building and Testing

Later in the day,

another long-time contributor, maintainer of the
plugin:kubernetes[Kubernetes plugin] and a number of Jenkins- and Maven-related
Docker containers, provided a great overview of the current state of using
containers for building and testing in Jenkins.

After a very busy two days at FOSDEM, a few contributors remained in Brussels
for a day-long
link:https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/236370750/[Post-FOSDEM Contributor Hackathon]
sponsored by CloudBees, Inc. and
link:https://www.betacowork.com/[Betacowork Brussels]. Trying to cram lots of
hacking into a single day is challenging, so the day was mostly filled with
discussions, some light prototyping, and a bit of recovery from the hectic
weekend at FOSDEM. :)

== Thanks

Of course I would like to extend many thanks to all the contributors who
participated in the various FOSDEM related events, but I would call special
attention to the logistics and planning work done by contributors Alyssa Tong,
Damien Duportal, and Olivier Vernin. Thanks to their work coordinating all the
plans, reservations, and schedules, we had a flawless weekend
of high-intensity Jenkins discussion, advocacy, and hacking.


I hope to see everybody back in Brussels next year for FOSDEM 2018!
