link:/blog/2016/09/19/blueocean-beta-declarative-pipeline-pipeline-editor/[Back in September 2016 we announced the availability of the Blue Ocean beta]
and the forthcoming Pipeline Editor. We are happy to announce that you can try
the Pipeline Editor preview today.

=== What is it?

The Pipeline Editor is the simplest way for anyone wanting to get started with
creating Pipelines in Jenkins. It's also great way for advanced Jenkins users
to start adopting Pipeline. It allows developers to break up their Pipeline into different
 stages and parallelize tasks that can occur at the same time - graphically.
 The rest is up to you.

Thats right, the days of writing Pipelines in your text editor are over. You can do it
all from Blue Ocean and have it produce a link://blog/2017/02/03/declarative-pipeline-ga/[Declarative Pipeline]
 `Jenkinsfile` for you. Not sure what a Jenkins Pipeline is? Why not checkout our link:/doc/[new guided tour]!

=== Whats next?

`Jenkinsfile`'s belong in the Git repository so that it is versioned a long side
your application code. In Blue Ocean, you will be able to edit a `Jenkinsfile`
for a branch directly from within the user interface using the Editor.

When you are done authoring your Pipeline, the pipeline definition is saved back
 to your repository as a `Jenkinsfile`.

If you ever need to change the Pipeline again,
 the user interface will allow you to jump back in into the editor to author the
 Pipeline at any time or you can do so in code by editing the `Jenkinsfile`
 directly with a text editor.

We are hoping to deliver this level of integration into Blue Ocean and the
Editor over the next few months, so be sure to check regularly for updates in
the Jenkins plugin manager.
