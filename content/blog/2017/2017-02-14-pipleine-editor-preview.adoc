link:/blog/2016/09/19/blueocean-beta-declarative-pipeline-pipeline-editor/[Back in September 2016 we announced the availability of the Blue Ocean beta]
and the forthcoming Visual Pipeline Editor. We are happy to announce that you can try
the Pipeline Editor preview release today.

=== What is it?

The Pipeline Editor is the simplest way for anyone wanting to get started with
creating Pipelines in Jenkins. It's also a great way for advanced Jenkins users
to start adopting pipeline. It allows developers to break up their pipeline into different
 stages and parallelize tasks that can occur at the same time - graphically.
 The rest is up to you.

A pipeline you create or edit visually can produce a link://blog/2017/02/03/declarative-pipeline-ga/[Declarative Pipeline] Jenkinsfile for you. This is a "round trip" editor which lets you load the pipeline back in later, for more editing. Not sure what a Jenkins Pipeline is? Why not check out our link:/doc/[new guided tour]!

=== Whats next?

`Jenkinsfile`s belong in the Git repository so that it is versioned a long side
your application code. In Blue Ocean, you will be able to edit a `Jenkinsfile`
for a branch directly from within the user interface using the Visual Pipeline Editor.

When you are done authoring your pipeline, the pipeline definition is saved back
 to your repository as a `Jenkinsfile`.

If you ever need to change the pipeline again,
 the user interface will allow you to jump back in into the editor to author the
 pipeline at any time or you can do so in code by editing the `Jenkinsfile`
 directly with a text editor.

We are hoping to deliver this level of integration into Blue Ocean and the
Visual Pipeline Editor over the next few months, so be sure to check regularly for updates in
the Jenkins plugin manager.

=== Get the Preview

The Visual Pipeline Editor is available in preview today.

To try it out today:
. Install the `Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor` from the Jenkins plugin manager
. Click on the `Open Blue Ocean` button and then the `Pipeline Editor` in the main navigation

Remember, we are looking forward to your feedback to help make the Editor
the easiest way to get started with Jenkins Pipeline. To report bugs or to
