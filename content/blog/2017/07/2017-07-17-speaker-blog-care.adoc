NOTE: This is a guest post by Mandy Hubbard, Software Engineer/QA Architect at

Imagine this: It’s 4:30pm on a Friday,
you have a major release on Monday, and your Jenkins server goes down.
It doesn't matter if it experienced a hardware failure,
fell victim to a catastrophic
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat-finger_error[fat-finger error],
or just got hit by a meteor - your Jenkins server is toast.
How long did it take to perfect your Pipeline,
all your Continuous Delivery jobs, plugins, and credentials?
Hopefully you at least have a recent backup of your Jenkins home directory,
but you’re still going have to work over the weekend with IT to procure a new server,
install it, and do full regression testing to be up and running by Monday morning.
Go ahead and take a moment, go to your car and just scream.
It will help ... a little.

But what if you could have a Jenkins environment that is completely disposable,
one that could be easily rebuilt at any time?
Using link:https://www.docker.com/[Docker] and Joyent’s
link:https://www.joyent.com/containerpilot[ContainerPilot], the team at
link:https://www.care.com/homepay[Care.com HomePay]
has created a production Jenkins environment that is completely software-defined.
Everything required to set up a new Jenkins environment is stored in source control,
versioned, and released just like any other software.
At Jenkins World, I’ll do a developer deep-dive into this approach during my technical session,
link:https://jenkinsworld20162017.sched.com/event/ALPr/disposable-jenkins[Indispensable, Disposable Jenkins],
including a demo of bringing up a fully configured Jenkins server in a Docker container.
For now, let me give you a basic outline of what we've done.

First, we add ContainerPilot to our Jenkins image by including it in the `Dockerfile`.

.Dockerfile
[source]
----
## ContainerPilot

ENV CONTAINERPILOT_VERSION 2.7.0
ENV CONTAINERPILOT_SHA256 3cf91aabd3d3651613942d65359be9af0f6a25a1df9ec9bd9ea94d980724ee13
ENV CONTAINERPILOT file:///etc/containerpilot/containerpilot.json

RUN curl -Lso /tmp/containerpilot.tar.gz https://github.com/joyent/containerpilot/releases/download/${CONTAINERPILOT_VERSION}/containerpilot-${CONTAINERPILOT_VERSION}.tar.gz && \
    echo "${CONTAINERPILOT_SHA256}  /tmp/containerpilot.tar.gz" | sha256sum -c && \
    tar zxf /tmp/containerpilot.tar.gz -C /bin && \
rm /tmp/containerpilot.tar.gz
----

Then we specify `containerpilot` as the Docker command in the `docker-compose.yml`
and pass the Jenkins startup script as an argument.
This allows ContainerPilot to perform our preStart business before starting the Jenkins server.

.docker-compose.yml
[source, yaml]
----
jenkins:
    image: devmandy/auto-jenkins:latest
    restart: always
    mem_limit: 8g
    ports:
      - 80
      - 22
    dns:
      - 8.8.8.8
      - 127.0.0.1
    env_file: _env
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    environment:
      - CONSUL=consul
    links:
      - consul:consul
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
      - "2222:22"
    command: >
      containerpilot
      /usr/local/bin/jenkins.sh
----

Configuration data is read from a Docker Compose `_env` file,
as specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file,
and stored in environment variables inside the container.
This is an example of our _env file:

._env
[source]
----
GITHUB_TOKEN=<my Github user token>
GITHUB_USERNAME=DevMandy
GITHUB_ORGANIZATION=DevMandy
DOCKERHUB_ORGANIZATION=DevMandy
DOCKERHUB_USERNAME=DevMandy
DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD=<my Dockerhub password>
DOCKER_HOST=<my Docker host, or localhost>
SLACK_TEAM_DOMAIN=DevMandy
SLACK_CHANNEL=jenkinsbuilds
SLACK_TOKEN=<my Slack token>
BASIC_AUTH=<my basic auth token>
AD_NAME=<my AD domain>
AD_SERVER=<my AD server>
PRIVATE_KEY=<my ssh private key, munged by a setup script>
----

Jenkins stores its credentials and plugin information in various xml files.
The `preStart` script modifies the relevant files,
substituting the environment variables as appropriate,
using a set of command line utilities called `xmlstarlet`.
Here is an example method from our `preStart` script that configures Github credentials:

[source, bash]
----
github_credentials_setup() {
    ## Setting Up Github username in credentials.xml file
    echo
    echo -e "Adding Github username to credentials.xml file for SSH key"
    xmlstarlet \
        ed \
        --inplace \
        -u '//com.cloudbees.jenkins.plugins.sshcredentials.impl.BasicSSHUserPrivateKey[id="github"]/username' \
        -v ${GITHUB_USERNAME} \
        ${JENKINS_HOME}/credentials.xml

    echo -e "Adding Github username to credentials.xml file for Github token"
    xmlstarlet \
        ed \
         --inplace \
        -u '//com.cloudbees.plugins.credentials.impl.UsernamePasswordCredentialsImpl[id="github_token"]/username' \
        -v ${GITHUB_USERNAME} \
        ${JENKINS_HOME}/credentials.xml

    PASSWORD=${GITHUB_TOKEN}
    echo -e "Adding Github token to credentials.xml"
    xmlstarlet \
        ed \
        --inplace \
        -u '//com.cloudbees.plugins.credentials.impl.UsernamePasswordCredentialsImpl[id="github_token"]/password' \
        -v ${PASSWORD} \
        ${JENKINS_HOME}/credentials.xml
}

This approach can be used to automate all things Jenkins.
These are just a few of the things I’ll show you in my Jenkins World session,
which you can build on to automate anything else your Jenkins environment needs.

*	Creation of credentials sets for interacting with third party services
like Github, Docker Hub and Slack
*	Configuration of the plugin:active-directory[Active Directory plugin]
and setup of matrix-based security
* Configuration of the plugin:github-organization-folder[Github Organization plugin],
which results in the automatic creation of all Jenkins pipeline jobs
by scanning the organization for all repositories containing a `Jenkinsfile`
*	Configuration of the
plugin:docker-workflow[Docker Pipeline plugin], including creating templates for all custom build agents
*	Configuration of the plugin:workflow-cps-global-lib[Global Pipeline Libraries plugin]
*	Configuration of the plugin:slack[Slack Notifier plugin]

With software-defined Jenkins, pipeline infrastructure
gains the same flexibility and resiliency as the rest of the development pipeline.
If we decide to change our Jenkins configuration in any way –
for example installing a new plugin or upgrading an existing one,
adding a new global library, or adding new Docker images for build agents –
we simply edit our `preStart` script to include these changes, build a new Docker image,
and the Jenkins environment is automatically reconfigured when we start a new container.
Because the entire configuration specification lives in a Github repository,
changes are merged to the "master" branch using pull requests,
and our Jenkins Docker image is tagged using
link:https://semver.org/[semantic versioning] just like any other component.
Jenkins can be both indispensable and completely disposable at the same time.
