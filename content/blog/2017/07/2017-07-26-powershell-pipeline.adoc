I am pleased to announce Microsoft PowerShell support for Jenkins Pipeline!
As of plugin:durable-task[Durable Task 1.14] and
plugin:workflow-durable-task-step[Pipeline Nodes and Processes Plugin 2.12], you will now be able to run Microsoft PowerShell scripts
directly in your Jenkins Pipeline projects.  This blog post covers the basics
of getting started with Microsoft PowerShell in Pipeline and provides some
basic examples.

== Introduction to Microsoft PowerShell

PowerShell is Microsoft's open source and cross platform command line shell, as
well as an automation and configuration tool/framework which has a broad user
base. PowerShell can be used to perform common system administration tasks in
Windows, macOS, and Linux environments. It can also be used as a general
purpose scripting language. Now that Jenkins Pipeline supports PowerShell, you
can enjoy the rich set of features in PowerShell for your daily DevOps work.

Before diving into using PowerShell in your Pipeline, I recommend reading the
link:https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms714469(v=vs.85).aspx[Windows
PowerShell Reference] as well as the
link:https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/[PowerShell Team Blog] for an
introduction to PowerShell features, utilities, and as a quick look into the
PowerShell language.  Microsoft also has an active
link:https://github.com/powershell/powershell[PowerShell community] on GitHub,
which I highly recommend visiting to submit feature requests and bug
reports as you see fit. Jenkins Pipeline currently supports Microsoft
PowerShell 3.0 or higher, so also be sure to check which version of PowerShell
is installed on your system in order to take advantage of PowerShell in your
Pipeline.  Please note that we recommend that you upgrade to the latest stable
version of PowerShell available, which as of this writing is version 5.1.14393.

=== The `powershell` step

[source,groovy]
----
node {
    powershell 'Write-Output "Hello, World!"'
}
----

== Using Microsoft PowerShell in Pipeline

Writing PowerShell code as part of your pipeline is incredibly simple. The step that you will use is
simply `powershell`, and it includes the same optional parameters as the
Windows Batch (`bat`) step, including:

* returnStdout: Returns the standard output stream with a default encoding of UTF-8 (alternative encoding is optional)
* returnStatus: Returns the exit status (integer) of the PowerShell script

=== Examples

==== Capture exit status of a PowerShell script

[source,groovy]
----
node {
    def status = powershell(returnStatus: true, script: 'ipconfig')
    if (status == 0) {
        // Success!
    }
}
----

==== Capture and print the output of a PowerShell script

[source,groovy]
----
node {
    def msg = powershell(returnStdout: true, script: 'Write-Output "PowerShell is mighty!"')
    println msg
}
----

=== Which streams get returned when I use `returnStdout`?

Until the release of PowerShell 5, there were five distinct output streams. PowerShell 5 introduced a sixth stream for pushing "informational" content,
with the added benefit of being able to capture messages sent to Write-Host. Each row of the following table describes a PowerShell stream along with
the corresponding Cmdlet used for writing to the stream for that particular row. Please keep in mind that stream 6 and associated cmdlets either
do not exist or exhibit alternate behavior in versions of PowerShell earlier than version 5.

|======================================================================================
|Stream |Description                   |Cmdlet
|1      |Output stream (e.g. stdOut)   |Write-Output
|2      |Error stream (e.g. stdErr)    |Write-Error
|3      |Warning stream                |Write-Warning
|4      |Verbose stream                |Write-Verbose
|5      |Debug stream                  |Write-Debug
|6      |Information stream            |Write-Information (or Write-Host with link:https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/heyscriptingguy/2015/07/04/weekend-scripter-welcome-to-the-powershell-information-stream/[caveats])
|======================================================================================

If you are using the `returnStdout` option of the `powershell` Pipeline step
then *only* stream 1 will be returned, while streams 2-6 will be redirected to
the console output. For example:

==== Write to all available streams and return the standard output

[source,groovy]
----
node {
    def stdout = powershell(returnStdout: true, script: '''
        # Enable streams 3-6
        $WarningPreference = 'Continue'
        $VerbosePreference = 'Continue'
        $DebugPreference = 'Continue'
        $InformationPreference = 'Continue'

        Write-Output 'Hello, World!'
        Write-Error 'Something terrible has happened!'
        Write-Warning 'Warning! There is nothing wrong with your television set'
        Write-Verbose 'Do not attempt to adjust the picture'
        Write-Debug 'We will control the horizontal.  We will control the vertical'
        Write-Information 'We can change the focus to a soft blur or sharpen it to crystal clarity.'
    ''')
    println stdout
}
----

===== Console output:

[source]
----
[Pipeline] {
[Pipeline] powershell

[Pipeline] }
[Pipeline] // node
[Pipeline] End of Pipeline
ERROR: script returned exit code 1
Finished: FAILURE
----

Note that "Hello, World!" gets printed last even though it is the first output
statement in my script.  Another interesting aspect of this example is that the
`powershell` step failed, which ultimately caused the job to fail. The failure
in this example is due to the PowerShell error stream being non-empty, which
therefore caused the step to result in a non-zero exit status. However, as you
will soon discover, there are a variety of causes for a failing `powershell`
step.

=== What causes a failing exit status?

When you execute a `powershell` step, it may produce a non-zero exit code and
fail your pipeline build.  This is very similar to other shell steps with some
interesting caveats. Your `powershell` step may produce a failing exit status
in the following instances:

1. Something in your PowerShell script has thrown an exception
2. Your PowerShell script explicitly calls `exit` with a non-zero exit code
3. Your PowerShell script calls a native application that produces a non-zero `$LastExitCode`
* $LastExitCode is an link:https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/reference/5.1/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_automatic_variables[automatic variable] that is set after executing a native application
4. Your PowerShell script results in a non-empty error stream (with or without throwing an exception)

Overriding the exit status behavior of your `powershell` step can be achieved
by explicitly exiting from your script as long as the failure was not caused by
an unhandled exception. For example:

==== Unavoidable failure caused by an unhandled exception

[source,groovy]
----
node {
    powershell '''
        throw 'Error! Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair'
        exit 0  # Unreachable code
    '''
}
----

==== Failed step caused by a non-empty error stream

[source,groovy]
----
node {
    powershell '''
        Write-Error 'Error! Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair'
    '''
}
----

==== Failure prevented by an explicit exit

[source,groovy]
----
node {
    powershell '''
        Write-Error 'Error! Problem Exists Between Keyboard And Chair'
        exit 0
    '''
}
----

=== Scripts vs. Cmdlets

A Cmdlet is a small lightweight utility written in either C#, and compiled, or
written in PowerShell directly. Depending on what your goal is in your pipeline
you can make use of Cmdlets directly in your pipeline code, call a self
contained PowerShell script, or some mixture of the two. If your strategy is to
keep each `powershell` step as short and succinct as possible then it may make
sense for you to write a library of Cmdlets, but if you have monolithic scripts
then it may make sense for you to call those scripts directly from your
pipeline. The choice is entirely up to you, as both scenarios are supported.
