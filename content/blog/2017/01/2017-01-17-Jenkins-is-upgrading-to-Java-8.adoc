**In the next few months, Jenkins will require Java 8 as its runtime.**

Back in
link:/blog/2016/11/22/what-jvm-versions-are-running-jenkins-the-return/[last November],
we discussed interesting statistics showing that Jenkins was now running Java 8
on a majority of its running instances.

== Timeline

Here is how we plan to roll that baseline upgrade in the next few months.

* Now: Announce the intention publicly.
* April, 2017: Drop support for Java 7 in Jenkins weekly.
   With the current rhythm, that means _2.52_ will most likely be the first weekly to require Java 8.
* June 2017: First LTS version requiring Java 8 is published.
   This should be something around _2.60.1_.


CAUTION: If you are still running Java 7, you will not be able to upgrade to the latest LTS version after some date probably around May 2017.

== Why Upgrade to Java 8

Balancing those numbers with many other criteria:

* Java 7 has been now end-of-lifed for 18+ months
* People are already moving away from Java 7, as show the numbers
** _52.8%_ of instances were already running Java 8 back in last November, and now reaching link:http://stats.jenkins.io/plugin-installation-trend/jvms.json[_58%_ two months later].
** If we only look at Jenkins 2.x, then we reach _72%_.
* Java 8 runtime is known from the field to be more stable
* Many developers have been wanting to be allowed to leverage the improvements that Java 8 provides to the language and platform
  (lambdas, Date/Time API... just to name a few).
  Being also a developer community, we want Jenkins to be appealing to contributors.
