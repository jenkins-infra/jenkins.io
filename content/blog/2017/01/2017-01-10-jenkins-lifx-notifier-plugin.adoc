Some time ago I encountered a link:http://www.lifx.com[LIFX] smart bulbs.
These are the bulbs with a chip inside - 50% bulb, 50% chip. There are mobile
applications for easy configuration and remote control of the bulb. Nothing
special here, it simply works and is very convenient to have such bulbs in
dormitory.

=== Brilliant idea time

99% of ideas which come to our minds either were already implemented by someone

And as it always happens, the developer inside me generated an idea which, as
it always happens, was implemented by someone else already.

The idea was: to connect a LIFX bulb to Jenkins server and update the color
according to a job's state.

Before starting to work on such Jenkins plugin, I searched for similar projects
on Google and the first links pointed me to existing
plugin:lifx-notifier[LIFX notifier plugin]
and a
link:https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/lifx-smart-lightbulb-build-notifier-plugin[blog post]
from
link:https://github.com/michaelneale[Michael Neale]
 who created the plugin. Michael's post describes exactly what I had in mind.

At this point I had 2 options:

* **forget** about building something new and just use the plugin
* **improve** existing plugin

First option is always easy and effortless, but second one is more challenging.

=== Improving an existing plugin

The existing plugin:lifx-notifier[LIFX notifier plugin]
did its job really well and I was able to connect my bulb to Jenkins and test
it. But it wasn't complete and had no configurable at all, therefore no
possibility to change the colors.

First, I read Jenkins contribution guidelines, which
link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Hosting+Plugins#HostingPlugins-Requesthosting[encourage]
developers to improve existing plugins (if any) and not create other versions
of plugins with similar functionality. Then I contacted the plugin author, Michael Neale,
via email and kindly asked for the contributor access in GitHub
for the existing plugin version. After a short discussion about my plans on this
plugin, Michael added me as a contributor to GitHub
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/lifx-notifier-plugin[repo] and wished me
good luck. Thanks Michael!

I wanted to improve the LIFX notifier plugin to add the ability
customize the colors (`in progress`, `build success` and `build failure`). This
is not a hard task actually.
A link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Plugins[1000+] plugins were
developed for Jenkins by the hackers like me, which means that I should have no
problem to do it as well.
Fortunately for me, I have used some plugins already which had a UI similar to
that I had planned to add to the LIFX notifier, such as:

. link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/hockeyapp-plugin[HockeyApp] plugin
. link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/fabric-beta-publisher-plugin[Fabric Beta publisher] plugin
. Different link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Plugins#Plugins-Buildnotifiers[Build notifiers] plugins

Reviewing the code for these plugins, plus Jenkins
link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Plugin+tutorial[plugin
development documentation], and of course looking over
link:http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-jelly/[Jelly components] helped
me to:

* Better understand the Jenkins architecture.
* Learn how Jenkins plugins work in general.
* Learn how to create the UI components for a plugin.
* Leanr how to subscribe to Jenkins job state changes using appropriate
  extension points.

In a few weeks I've finished my plugin modifications and added unit tests for
its major parts.  As a result, the plugin now has a UI configuration section in
`Post-build Actions` which is self descriptive:

image::/images/post-images/2017-01-02/plugin-configuration.png[plugin configuration, role="center"]

The last step was to prepare new plugin version and publish it to the world!
The Jenkins
link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Hosting+Plugins["Hosting
plugins"] document describes step by step process of how to publish a plugin.

**This includes many steps which should be respected very carefully.**

=== What I've learned

It was my first experience in Jenkins plugins development. I should say that
**steep learning curve is high enough**, and sometimes is really hard to find
answers on appearing questions. But in general it's all about `Java`, `XML`,
`Maven` and **it's a lot of fun** developing Jenkins plugins.
