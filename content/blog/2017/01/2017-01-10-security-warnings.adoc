Jenkins 2.40 was released earlier this week, and readers of the
link:/changelog[changelog]
will have noticed that it now includes the ability to show security warnings
published by the configured update site.  But what does that mean?

In the past, we've notified users about security issues in Jenkins and in
plugins through various means: Emails to the
link:https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories[jenkinsci-advisories mailing list]
(which I recommend you subscribe to), blog posts, and, recently, emails to the
oss-security mailing list.  But I still wanted to increase the reach of our
notifications, to make sure Jenkins admins are informed quickly about possible
security problems on their instances.  The logical next step was to include
these notifications in Jenkins itself, and that feature has been added in
Jenkins 2.40.

Today we enabled the publication of warnings on our update sites: Once Jenkins
2.40 (or newer) refreshes its cache of update site metadata, it may now inform
you that you're using a vulnerable plugin that should be updated or removed.
Right now, these aren't previously unknown warnings, but reference security
advisories for plugin vulnerabilities that have been published over the past few
years.

We will of course continue to publish security advisories using the mailing
list of the same name, as well other means.

Stay safe!
