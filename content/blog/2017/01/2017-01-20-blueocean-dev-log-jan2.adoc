As we get closer to
link:/projects/blueocean[Blue Ocean]
1.0, which is planned for the end of March, I have started
link:/blog/2017/01/13/blueocean-dev-log-jan/[highlighting]
some of the good stuff that has been going on, and this week was a _very_ busy week.

A new Blue Ocean beta (*b18*) was released with:

* Parametrized pipelines are now supported!
* i18n improvements
* Better support for matrix and the _evil_ (yet somehow still used) Maven project type (don't use it!)
* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events[SSE] fixes for IE and Edge browsers
* An alpha release of the Visual Editor for Jenkinsfiles on top of
  link:/blog/2017/01/12/declarative-pipeline-beta-2/[Declarative Pipeline]
  has snuck into the "experimental" update center. Andrew will be talking
  about Declarative Pipelines at
  link:https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/event/declarative_pipeline/[FOSDEM next week].


== Parametrized Pipelines

You would know this if you followed
link:https://twitter.com/ThorScherler[Thorsten's twitter account].

That twitter account is mostly pics of Thorsten in running gear, but
occasionally he announces new features as they land.

When you run a pipeline that requires parameters, it will popup a dialog
like this no matter where you run it from. Most input types are supported
(similar to input), with a planned extension point for custom input types.

=== Editor

A very-very early version of the
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/blueocean-pipeline-editor-plugin[Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor plugin]
that will set your hair on fire of the editor is in the experimental update
center.

Declarative pipelines are still not at version 1.0 status, but will be
shortly. This editor allows you to roundtrip Jenkinsfiles written in this
way, so they can be edited as text, or visually. The steps available are
discovered form the installed plugins. One to watch.


So, *what's next?*

* Creation of Git Pipelines, and likely GitHub too.
* Show parallel branches that aren't in a stage visually
* Show stderr/out in test reports
* Show more information when Jenkins is "busy", such as when agents are coming online, in the Pipeline view


Enjoy!
