As we get closer to
link:/projects/blueocean[Blue Ocean]
1.0, which is planned for the end of March, I figured it would be great to
highlight some of the good stuff that has been going on. It's been a
busy-as-usual week as everyone comes back from vacation.  A couple of new betas
went out this week. Of note:

* `input` to Pipelines is now supported, a much asked for feature (see below)
* A new French translation
* Some optimisations (especially around reducing number of HTTP calls). We
  have started using
  link:http://gtmetrix.com[gtmetrix.com]
  to measure changes on
  link:https://ci.blueocean.io["dogfood"]
  to get some numbers around optimisations on the web tier.
* And a grab bag of other great bug fixes.

Also a bunch of work has been done to support parametrized pipelines, as
well as creation of new multibranch pipelines (both are much asked for).

There is also now an "official" Docker image being published to
link:https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkinsci/blueocean/[Docker Hub]. The Pipeline
building the container is run weekly and will be picking up newly tagged
releases of Blue Ocean.

Running the latest can be as simple as:

[source]
----
docker run -p 8888:8080 jenkinsci/blueocean:latest
----

This is built on the incredibly popular
link:https://hub.docker.com/_/jenkins/[official "jenkins" image]
(10M pulls can't all be wrong!). The container also has tags available (e.g.
`jenkinsci/blueocean:1.0.0-b16`) for grabbing a specific released version.

Up next for Blue Ocean development as we march towards 1.0:

* Support for parametrized jobs. For which a bunch of api work has already been
  done.
* Creation of the new Pipeline GUI
* Preview release of the Visual Editor for
  link:/blog/2017/01/12/declarative-pipeline-beta-2/[Declarative Pipeline].
* The new header design will be applied

Enjoy!
