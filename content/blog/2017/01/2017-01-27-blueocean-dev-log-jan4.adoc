As we get closer to
link:/projects/blueocean[Blue Ocean]
1.0, which is planned for the end of March, I have
link:/blog/2017/01/13/blueocean-dev-log-jan/[started]
link:/blog/2017/01/20/blueocean-dev-log-jan2/[highlighting]
some of the good stuff that has been going on. This week was 10 steps forward, and about 1.5 backwards...

There were two releases this week, `b19` and `b20`. Unfortunately, `b20` had to
be released shortly after `b19` hit the Update Center as an incompatible API
change in a 3rd party plugin was discovered.

Regardless, the latest `b20` has a *lot* of important improvements, and some
very nice new features.

* A first cut of the "Create Pipeline" UX, seen above, allowing you to create Git
  based link:/doc/book/pipeline/multibranch/[Multibranch Pipelines] like you have never seen before.
* Handling network disconnections from the browser to server (eg server
  restart, network etc) gracefully with a nice UI.
* More precise time information for steps and running Pipelines.
* More information when a Pipeline is blocked on infrastructure, such as when
  the Pipeline is waiting for an agent to become available.
* Fixed a really embarrassing typo (a prize if you spot it).
* Test reports now include stdout and stderr
* Better support for parallel visualisation, such as when a `parallel` step exists outside of a stage.
* The Visual Editor also had another release, with the "sheets" visual component
  and better validation.

== Creation

Currently this is hidden behind a
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_toggle[feature toggle],
to access append `?blueCreate` to the URL in you browser, and then press the
"New Pipeline" button. Currently it lets you quickly create a Pipeline from
Git, add credentials, etc, in a very nice UX. More SCM types are being added to
support this.

== Reconnect/disconnect

As Blue Ocean is a very "live" style of UX, if your network becomes
unavailable, or the server is restarted, it is good to know in case you
were staring at the screen waiting for something to happen (don't you have
anything better to do??). When this happens, now you get a polite message,
and then when the connection is restored, even if you are waiting for a
Pipeline run to finish, it will then notice this, and refresh things for
you:

Note the opacity changes to make it clear even if you don't see the little
message. Very nice addition for those of us who work on a train far to often.

== Up next

What is up next:

* SCM Api changes should land, making things much better for users of
  GitHub, Bitbucket, and many more.
* Creating Pipelines from GitHub (including automatic discovery).
* Lots of fixes and enhancements in the Pipeline from all over the place
* More ATH footnote:[Acceptance Test Harness] coverage against regressions
* More Visual Editor releases as Declarative Pipeline reaches version 1.0
* Improvements to i18n


There was also a couple of "alternative beta" releases in the "Experimental
Update Center" to help test the new SCM API improvements for better use of
GitHub APIs (based on
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/blueocean-plugin/pull/742[this branch])
I do not recommend trying this branch unless you know what you are doing,
as this will migrate some data, but help testing it would be appreciated!


Enjoy!
