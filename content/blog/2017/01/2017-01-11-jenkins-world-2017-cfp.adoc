The largest Jenkins event, https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsworld/home[Jenkins
World] is coming to San Francisco, California on *August 28 - 31, 2017*, at the
Marriott Marquis.  This conference will feature two days of hands-on training,
workshops, and certification exams followed by two more days with five tracks
of technical sessions from Jenkins and DevOps experts from around the world.

Inspire your peers and colleagues by sharing your expertise and experience as
one of the Jenkins World speakers.
https://www.papercall.io/jenkins-world-2017[The Call for Papers is open], last
day for submitted a proposal is *March 5th, 2017.*

link:/blog/tags/jenkinsworld/[Compared to Jenkins World 2016], what's new for
2017?  Two tracks are now dedicated to "show and tell." These sessions are
technically advanced with code sharing, heavy on demos, and only a few slides.
If you are like most of us - driven to learn, share, and collaborate...we'd
like to hear from you!

Looking forward to your amazing proposal(s)!
