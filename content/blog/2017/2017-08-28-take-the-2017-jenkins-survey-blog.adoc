Dawson] on behalf of CloudBees, where he works as a DevOps Evangelist
responsible for developing and sharing continuous delivery and DevOps best
practices. He also serves as the CloudBees Product Marketing Manager for
Jenkins.

Once again it’s that time of year when CloudBees sponsors the
link:https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/jenkins-2017[Jenkins Community Survey] to
assist the community with gathering objective insights into how jenkins is
being used and what users would like to see in the Jenkins project.

*Your personal information (name, email address and company) will NOT be used by CloudBees for
sales or marketing.*

As an added incentive to take the survey, *CloudBees will enter participants
into a drawing for a free pass to Jenkins World 2018 (1st prize) and a $100
Amazon Gift Card (2nd prize).* The survey will close at the end of September, so
click the link at the end of the blog post to get started!

All participants will be able to access reports summarizing survey results. If
you’re curious about what insights your input will provide, see the results of
last year’s 2016 survey:

community trends and needs. There are laws that govern prize giveaways and
eligibility; CloudBees has compiled all those fancy
