image:lambda.png[role="right"] As link:/blog/2017/01/17/Jenkins-is-upgrading-to-Java-8/[announced some weeks ago], starting with version link:https://jenkins.io/changelog/#v2.54[Jenkins **2.54**], the Java runtime requirement has been updated to Java 8.

== Timeline

* link:/blog/2017/01/17/Jenkins-is-upgrading-to-Java-8/[Earlier this year: announce this upgrade].
* April, 2017: Drop support for Java 7 in Jenkins weekly: **2.54**.
* June, 2017: First LTS version requiring Java 8 is published.

== FAQ

I have only a JRE 7 available, can I still run Jenkins 2.54+ with it?::
No, you need to install a JRE 8.

Can I still run my agents with Java 7?::
No. An agent must run at least the Java version which the Jenkins Master was compiled for.
This means you must also upgrade your agents JVM if they are still running Java 7.
