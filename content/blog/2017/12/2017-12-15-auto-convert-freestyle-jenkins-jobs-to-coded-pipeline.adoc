link:https://www.infostretch.com[Infostretch] has created a
link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/convert-to-pipeline[plugin] for teams
upgrading from Freestyle Jobs to Pipelines as code with Jenkins Pipeline.
This new plugin streamlines the process and accelerates
pipeline on-boarding for any new set of applications. Previously, when
upgrading to Jenkins Pipeline, converting Freestyle Jobs required developers
to drill down on each one of those hundreds (or thousands!)  of jobs to understand
tools, configurations, URLs, parameters, and more before rewriting them in
link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax[Pipeline syntax]. This process is very manual,
error-prone, lengthy, and not cost-effective. Beyond saving time, the new
plugin also assures adherence to proper coding standards and separates complex
business logic and standards declaration from execution flow.

Key features:

* Convert single freestyle job to pipeline
* Convert chain of freestyle jobs to single pipeline
* Works with both Jenkins and CloudBees Jenkins Enterprise
* Plugin can be customized to support any Freestyle plugin and an
  organization's link:/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries[Pipeline Shared Library],
  or Groovy coding standards.
* Works with CloudBees' Role-based Access Control to help the new Pipelines
  comply with existing security policies.
* Direct migration of properties such as "Build with Parameters" to newly
  created Pipelines.
* Direct migration of Agent on which job is to be run with support for multiple agent labels across different downstream jobs
* Environment properties: JDK, NodeJS
* Supports Git SCM.
* Build steps: Maven, Ant, Shell, Batch, and Ansible Playbook.
* Post build actions: artifact archiver, simple mailer, TestNG reports, JUnit reports, checkstyle publisher

Now, let’s take a look at how to get started:

. Click on a link at Root level or Folder level or Job level.
+

+
. Select the job from the drop-down list that is the beginning point of the
"chain". If job level link is clicked, this drop-down list will not be visible.
+

+
Provide the new pipeline job name. If this is not specified, the plugin will
attempt to create a new pipeline job with the naming convention of
"oldname-pipeline".
+
. Check "Recursively convert downstream jobs if any?" if you wish to have all the
downstream jobs converted into this new pipeline. The plugin will write all the
logic of current and downstream jobs into a single pipeline.
+
. Check "Commit Jenkinsfile?" if you would like the plugin to create a
Jenkinsfile and commit it back to the SCM. The plugin will commit the
Jenkinsfile at the root of the SCM repository it finds in the first job
(selected in step 1 above). It will attempt to commit to this repo using the
credentials it finds in the first job.
+
. Do note that the plugin will checkout the repo in to a temporary workspace on
the master (JENKINS_HOME/plugins/convert-to-    pipeline/ws). Once the
conversion is complete and Jenkinsfile is committed back to the repo, the
workspace will be deleted.
+
. Click "Convert" to convert the Freestyle job configurations to a single
scripted pipeline job. Once the conversion is complete and the new job is
created, you will be redirected to the newly created pipeline job.

That’s it!
