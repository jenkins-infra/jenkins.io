Jenkins project congratulates all users and contributors with the New Year!
Let's take a look at some changes this year.

## Highlights

* We released major features like link:/projects/blueocean[BlueOcean]
and link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#declarative-pipeline[Declarative Pipeline]
** These features offer a new user experience in Jenkins Web UI, powered by link:/doc/book/pipeline/[Jenkins Pipeline].
* In Jenkins 2.54 we updated the Java minimal requirement to Java 8 (link:/blog/2017/04/10/jenkins-has-upgraded-to-java-8/[announcement]).
* Plugin CI has been moved to our link:https://ci.jenkins.io/[Jenkins-on-Jenkins instance].
All plugins are being built by Jenkins Pipeline with a special link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/pipeline-library[pipeline library]
* We adopted the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/1/README.adoc#what-is-a-jep[Jenkins Enhancement Proposal (JEP)] process for major changes in Jenkins.
There are already JEPs under review:

** link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/200[JEP-200: Switch Remoting/XStream blacklist to a whitelist]

## Some stats

In 2017 we had **60** weekly and **13** LTS releases with **305** fixes/enhancements only in the core.
Next week Jenkins is going to hit the `2.100` version, and the core changed greatly since the `2.0` release in April 2016.
link:/security/[Jenkins Security] was one of the hottest areas this year, there were **7** link:/security/advisories/[security advisories] for the core and *15* - for plugins.
For comparison, in 2016 there were only **6** security releases in total.

There were **2605** plugin releases, and **>215** NEW plugins have been hosted in the Update Center.
In particular Jenkins ecosystem has greatly expanded into the Cloud space
by offering dozens of new plugins (e.g. for Azure and Kubernetes).
We also got many new plugins providing integrations with various Development and DevOps tools.

Other subprojects and Jenkins components also got major updates.
For example,
link:https://jenkins.io//projects/remoting/[Jenkins Remoting] got 15 releases with stability improvements.
link:https://github.com/stapler/stapler[Stapler Framework] also got 6 releases.

Keep updating, Jenkins 2 is not only about Pipeline as Code!
