The first Jenkins User Conference China was held on November 19, 2017 in
Shanghai, China. It was an amazing conference for Jenkins users in China. There were
almost 450 attendees to enjoy a lovely day with Jenkins creator, Kohsuke Kawaguchi.

There were 12 wonderful presentations, 1 workshop and 1 open space to set the stage for JUC China.
The day began with Kohsuke, welcomed to the stage by all the attendees here with their warm
applauses. All of them are fans of Jenkins and Kohsuke.  Thanks to Kohsuke, he made a wonderful presentation to show the past, present and future of Jenkins for Chinese Jenkins users.

The co-founder of DevOps Times community, Le Zhang released a report of adoption of Deployment Pipeline in Chinese IT organization.
The report shows that Jenkins is the most popular tool for DevOps and CD in China.

It also has proven that “If it hurts, do it more often!” is right because the IT organization who deploy more frequently, deployment  failure would be less.

Lastly, as an organizer for JUC China, I would like to thank Kohsuke Kawaguchi, Alyssa Tong, Sam Van Oort and so many friends from CloudBees and Jenkins community to have given us so many help to make the first JUC China an amazing and successful conference for Jenkins users in China. We look forward to organizing many more JUC China.
