link:https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsworld[Jenkins World] is approaching fast,
and the event staff are all busy preparing.
I've decided to do something different this year as part of my keynote:
I want to invite a few Jenkins users like you come up on stage with me.

There have been amazing developments in Jenkins over the past year.
For my keynote, I want highlight how the new Jenkins
(Pipeline as code with the `Jenkinsfile`, no more creating jobs,
link:/projects/blueocean[Blue Ocean])
is different and better than the old Jenkins (freestyle jobs, chaining jobs together, etc.).
All these developments have helped Jenkins users,
and it would be more meaningful to have fellow users, like you, share their stories
about how recent Jenkins improvements like Pipeline and Blue Ocean have positively impacted them.

If you're interested sharing your story, please complete
link:https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScMpoJNDwpDmAqwNUhZT1oRzPs9YZMuPivlUWrMTbI9ZKAOhA/viewform?c=0&w=1[this form]
so that I can contact you.
This is a great opportunity to let
the rest of the world (and your boss!) hear about your accomplishments.
Youâ€™ll also get into Jenkins World for free and get to join me backstage.
If you concerns about traveling to Jenkins World,
I'm happy to discuss helping with that as well.

I look forward to hearing from you.
