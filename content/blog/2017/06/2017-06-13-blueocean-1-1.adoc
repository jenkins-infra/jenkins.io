The Blue Ocean team are proud to announce the release of Blue Ocean 1.1.
 We’ve shipped a tonne of small improvements, features and bug fixes here that
 will make your day-to-day experience with Blue Ocean even smoother.

Today is also the first time we are promoting
our link:/projects/blueocean/roadmap[Public Roadmap].
We recognise that using JIRA can be a bit of a pain to track what we are working
 on at a macro level and the Public Roadmap makes it very easy for anyone to
 find out what we are working on. We’ve got some really cool stuff coming,
 so check back here soon!

It’s been an insane two months since the launch of Blue Ocean 1.0 and there
 are now officially over 10,000 teams using Blue Ocean  – so here’s a big
 “thank you” to all of you for your support.

Now, lets get to the goods!

== Fast search

For those of you who have many pipelines we’ve introduced pipeline fast search
to the pipeline dashboard. Click the search icon to activate and just start
typing what you’re looking for.

== Trigger reasons

Differentiate at a glance between pipeline runs that have been manually
triggered and by who, triggered automatically by a commit or triggered by any
other means.

== Blockage reasons

Pipelines can be blocked from execution for a variety of reasons, including
waiting for executors or other resources to become free. You can see from the
Pipeline Activity, Branch and Result screen why the pipeline is blocked from
execution.

== History jump

Developers can quickly jump from the branches tab to the run history for a
specific branch. This makes it more convenient to see historical runs for the
branch within the Pipeline which improves the your ability to trace down
problems.

== Analyse 1,000s of tests

Now you can see more than 100 test results for a Pipeline run. This makes
Blue Ocean practical for teams who have invested heavily in testing.
We've also dramatically improved loading times for Pipelines with large
numbers of tests so theres no more waiting for the test tab to load.

== Custom run names and descriptions
Developers authoring Pipeline using the scripted syntax can set a custom name
and description for Pipeline run. This feature is commonly used to name or
describe a pipeline run that is meaningful in their release management workflow.

For example, a developer can set the run name to the release version
`1.1` and the description to something meaningful, like `Final Release`.

```
currentBuild.displayName = '1.1'
currentBuild.description = ‘Final Release’
```

## Performance
We’ve been making optimisations for general page speed.
In Blue Ocean 1.1, plugin data was automatically sent to browser and we’ve made
a change so that this data is only sent on the request of plugins. The long and
short of it is that you shouldn't notice a thing except those Blue Ocean pages
zipping faster into your browser.

## 48+ bug fixes
There have been a total of 48 bug improvements, with emphasis on how executing
pipelines behave, and we’ve  invested a large amount of time to improve
automated test coverage of Blue Ocean to ensure reliability in
production settings.
