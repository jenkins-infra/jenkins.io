Blue Ocean is a new user experience for Jenkins,
and version 1.0 is now live!
Blue Ocean makes Jenkins, and continuous delivery, approachable to all team members.
In my link:/blog/2017/04/05/welcome-to-blue-ocean[previous post],
I explained how to install Blue Ocean on your local Jenkins instance and switch to using Blue Ocean.
As promised, here's a screencast that picks up where that post left off.
Starting from a clean Jenkins install, the video below will guide you through
creating and running your first Pipeline in Blue Ocean with the Visual Pipeline Editor.

Please Enjoy! In my next video, I'll go over the
