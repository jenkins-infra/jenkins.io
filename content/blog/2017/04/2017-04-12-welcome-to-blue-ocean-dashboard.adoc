Blue Ocean is a new user experience for Jenkins,
and version 1.0 is now live!
Blue Ocean makes Jenkins, and continuous delivery, approachable to all team members.
In my link:/blog/2017/04/11/welcome-to-blue-ocean-pipeline-activity[previous post],
I used the Blue Ocean Activity View to track the state of branches and
Pull Requests in one project.
In this video, I'll use the Blue Ocean Dashboard get a personalized view of the
areas that of my project that are most important to me,
and also to monitor multiple projects.
Please Enjoy!
