Back in May 2016 link:/blog/2016/05/26/introducing-blue-ocean/[we announced our intent]
to rethink the Jenkins User experience with the Blue Ocean project and today
the Jenkins project are pleased to announce the general
availability of Blue Ocean 1.0.

Blue Ocean is an entirely new, modern and fun way for developers to use Jenkins
that has been built from the ground up to help teams of any size approach
Continuous Delivery. Easily installed as a plugin for Jenkins and integrated
with Jenkins Pipeline, it is available from today for production use.

Since the start of the beta at Jenkins World 2016 in September there are now
over 7400+ installations making use of Blue Ocean. This wouldn‚Äôt be possible
without the support of the entire Jenkins developer and
user community - so thank you for your support!

Blue Ocean is available today from the update center and also as a
Docker image - link:/projects/blueocean[why not give it a try?]

*Visual Pipeline Editing* - Team members of any skill level can create continuous
delivery pipelines from start to finish, with just several clicks, using the
intuitive, visual pipeline editor. Any pipeline created with the visual editor
can also be edited in your favorite text editor
bringing all the benefits of Pipeline as Code.

*Pipeline Visualization* - Developers can visually represent pipelines in a way
that anyone on the team can understand - even your boss's boss - improving
clarity into the continuous delivery process for the whole organization.
The visualization helps you focus on what the pipeline does, not how it does it.

*Pinpoint Troubleshooting* - Blue Ocean enables developers to locate automation
problems instantly, without endlessly scanning through logs or navigating
through many screens, so you can get back to building the next big thing.

*GitHub and Git Integration* - Pipelines are created for all feature branches
and pull requests, with their status reported back to GitHub.
The whole team has visibility into whether changes need work or are good to go.

*Personalization* ‚Äì Every team member can make Jenkins their own by customizing
the dashboard so that they only see those pipelines that matter to them.
Favoriting any pipeline or branch in Blue Ocean will show a favourite card on
the dashboard so you can see its status at a glance.

Just one more thing ‚Äì I‚Äôd like to pay special thanks to:

- *The Core team* ‚Äì to Keith Zantow, Thorsten Scherler, Tom Fennelly,
Ivan Meredith, Josh McDonald, Vivek Pandey, Brody Maclean and Cliff Meyers.
Each of and everyone of you have brought your own passion, expertise and flair
to the project ‚Äì and it shows. It‚Äôs been crazy fun and I hope working on
Blue Ocean is something you look back on fondly.
- *Jenkins Developers* past and present ‚Äì we recognise that we are standing on
the shoulders of giants and none of this wouldn‚Äôt be possible without your
hard work and dedication to free & open source software and Jenkins.
Here‚Äôs to the next 10 years üçª !
- *CloudBees* ‚Äì in particular, Sacha Labourey (CEO), Harpreet Singh
(VP of Product) and Spike Washburn (VP of Engineering) whose dedication to
Jenkins, Open Source and continued faith in the vision and team made all of
this possible, and of course Bob Bickel (Advisor) who dared us to dream big.
- *Michael Neale* ‚Äì who drank all the kool-aide and is just as obsessed with
and dedicated to Blue Ocean as I am. This project would never have shipped
without his hand steady at the tiller. I couldn‚Äôt ask for a better friend
and partner-in-crime.
- *Tyler Croy* ‚Äì for guiding the project and myself on how to do open source
The Right Way‚Ñ¢. Tyler works tirelessly behind the scenes to to make Jenkins
awesome and it wouldn‚Äôt be possible to keep this show running without
his help and sage-like advice.
- *Kohsuke Kawaguchi* ‚Äì For creating Jenkins, getting Blue Ocean off of
the ground, his tour of Tokyo and above all, his trust.
- *Jenkins Users* ‚Äì your enthusiasm for better development tools which
kept our spirits and momentum up when the days grew long and things
looked tough. We couldn‚Äôt ask for a better, more appreciative or
passionate group of people. Hopefully we‚Äôve done our job and you can get
back to building your next big thing!

Next stop, some well needed rest & recovery then back to to making
Jenkins one of the experiences for software developers worldwide!
