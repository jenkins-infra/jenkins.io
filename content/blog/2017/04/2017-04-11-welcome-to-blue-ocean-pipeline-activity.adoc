Blue Ocean is a new user experience for Jenkins,
and version 1.0 is now live!
Blue Ocean makes Jenkins, and continuous delivery, approachable to all team members.
In my link:/blog/2017/04/06/welcome-to-blue-ocean-editor[previous post],
I showed how easy it is to create and edit Declarative Pipelines using the Blue Ocean Visual Pipeline Editor.
In this video, I'll use the Blue Ocean Activity View to track the
state of branches and Pull Requests in one project.
Blue Ocean makes it so much easier to find the logs I need to triage failures.

Please Enjoy!  In my
link:/blog/2017/04/12/welcome-to-blue-ocean-dashboard[next video],
I'll switch from looking at a single project to monitoring multiple projects with
the Blue Ocean Dashboard.
