Multiple Jenkins plugins received updates today that fix several security vulnerabilities, including multiple _high severity_ ones.

We strongly recommend updating the following plugins as soon as possible:

* plugin:blueocean[Blue Ocean]
* plugin:workflow-cps[Pipeline: Groovy Plugin]
* plugin:script-security[Script Security Plugin]

Less severe security updates have been released for these plugins:

* plugin:config-file-provider[Config File Provider Plugin]
* plugin:datadog[Datadog Plugin]
* plugin:deploy[Deploy to container Plugin]
* plugin:dry[DRY Plugin]
* plugin:pipeline-input-step[Pipeline: Input Step Plugin]
* plugin:analysis-core[Static Analysis Utilities Plugin]

Additionally, the plugin:dependency-check-jenkins-plugin[OWASP Dependency-Check Plugin] recently also received a security update.

For an overview of what was fixed, see the link:/security/advisory/2017-08-07[security advisory].
