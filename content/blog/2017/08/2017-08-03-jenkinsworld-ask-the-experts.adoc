There are less than four weeks left until Jenkins World 2017. As usual, Jenkins
World would not be complete without the Jenkins projects' "Ask the Experts". If
you are new to Jenkins World, the Jenkins project booth will be located on the
expo floor where contributors to the project hang out, share demos, and
help users via the "Ask the Experts" program. I hope you will be pleasantly
surprised at the amount of 1-on-1 learning to be had in the booth!

We have a great list of experts who have volunteered to help staff the booth,
including many frequent contributors, JAM organizers, and board members:

If you are an active member of the Jenkins community and/or a contributor,
consider taking part in the "Ask the Experts" program. It’s a great opportunity
