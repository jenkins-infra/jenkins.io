Pipeline] is an important Jenkins feature for creating and managing a project
in Jenkins. This is opposed to the traditional way of creating a Jenkins
project by using the Jenkins GUI. When running your open-source load test,
Jenkins Pipeline enables resilience, execution control, advanced logic and
Version Control management.  This blog post will explain how to run any
open-source load test with Jenkins Pipeline, through Taurus.

link:https://gettaurus.org/[Taurus] is an open source test automation framework
that enables running and analyzing tests from 9 open source load and functional
testing tools: link:https://www.blazemeter.com/jmeter-load-testing[JMeter],
Selenium, Gatling, The Grinder, Locust, Tsung, Siege, Apache Bench, and PBench.
Test results can be analyzed in Taurus. For advanced analyses or running tests
in the cloud, Taurus integrates with

### Getting started with Taurus

. Install link:https://gettaurus.org[Taurus].
. Create the following Taurus configuration in YAML. Learn more about YAML in Taurus from
link:https://gettaurus.org/docs/YAMLTutorial/[this tutorial].
+
[source, yaml]
----
## execution:
- concurrency: 100
  hold-for: 10m
  ramp-up: 120s
  scenario: Thread Group
scenarios:
  Thread Group:
    requests:
    - label: blazedemo
      method: GET
      url: http://blazedemo.com/
----
+
This script runs 100 concurrent users, holds the load for 10 minutes, the
ramp-up is 120 seconds and the thread group runs one GET request to
`blazedemo.com`.
+
You can specify an executor by adding `executor: <executor_name>` to the
script. Otherwise, the default executor will be JMeter. In the background,
Taurus will create an artifact directory with a jmx file (or a Scala file if
you run Gatling, a Python file if you are running Selenium, etc.).
+
. Open a terminal and run: `bzt <file_name>.yml`
. View the test results:

If you want to conduct an in-depth analysis of your test results, run your
tests on BlazeMeter. You will be able to monitor KPIs through advanced and
colorful reports, evaluate system health over time, and run your tests from
multiple geo-locations.

Run the following command from the terminal:

[source,bash]
----
bzt <file_name>.yml -report
----

### Integrate Taurus With Pipeline

To run Taurus through link:/doc/book/pipeline[Pipeline], you can also go
straight to Jenkins after creating your Taurus script.

. Open Jenkins -> New Item -> Fill in an item name -> Click on ‘Pipeline’
+

+

+
. Now create a Pipeline script. You can include all parts of
your CI/CD process in this script: Commit, Build, Unit Test, Performance Test,
etc., by creating different stages.
+
This Pipeline has three stages: The first is called “build”. In this example it
is empty, but you can add commands that will build your code. The second,
called “Performance Tests”, creates a folder called “Taurus-Repo” and runs the
Taurus script that we created. At the same time (note the “parallel” command),
there is a “sleep” command for 60 seconds. Obviously it makes no sense to put
those two commands together, this is just to show you the option of running 2
commands in parallel. The third stage called “Deploy” is also empty in this
example. This is where you could deploy your new version.
+
[source, groovy]
----
node {
   stage('Build') {
      // Run the Taurus build
   }
   stage('Performance Tests') {
    parallel(
        BlazeMeterTest: {
            dir ('Taurus-Repo') {
                sh 'bzt <file_name>.yml -report'
            }
        },
        Analysis: {
            sleep 60
        })
   }

   stage(‘Deploy’) {
   }
}
----
+
image::/images/post-images/jenkinsworld2017/blazemeter/blazemeter-speaker-blog-2017-5.png[]
+
Note that you can either add the Pipeline inline, or choose the “Pipeline
script from SCM” option and add the URL to the script on GitHub (in this case
you need to upload a `Jenkinsfile` to GitHub). With "Pipeline from SCM",
whenever you need to update the tests, you can just add new commits to the
`Jenkinsfile`.
+
. Save the Pipeline
. Click on ‘Build Now’ to run the Pipeline
+
image::/images/post-images/jenkinsworld2017/blazemeter/blazemeter-speaker-blog-2017-6.png[]
+
. Click on the new Build that is running now (build #6 in this example).
+
image::/images/post-images/jenkinsworld2017/blazemeter/blazemeter-speaker-blog-2017-7.png[]
+
. Click on ‘Console Output’ to see the test results:
+
image::/images/post-images/jenkinsworld2017/blazemeter/blazemeter-speaker-blog-2017-8.png[]
+
. In the Console Output you can see the test results and also the link to the report in BlazeMeter.
