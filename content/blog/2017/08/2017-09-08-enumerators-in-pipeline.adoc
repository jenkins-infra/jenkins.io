While at Jenkins World, link:https://github.com/kohsuke[Kohsuke Kawaguchi]
presented two long-time Jenkins contributors with a
"link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_matter_of_programming[Small Matter of Programming]"
award: link:https://github.com/abayer[Andrew Bayer] and
link:https://github.com/jglick[Jesse Glick]. "Small Matter of Programming"
being:

[quote, Wikipedia]
____
a phrase used to ironically indicate that a suggested feature or design change
would in fact require a great deal of effort; it often implies that the person
proposing the feature underestimates its cost.
____

In this context the "Small Matter" relates to link:/doc/book/pipeline[Jenkins
Pipeline] and a very simple snippet of Scripted Pipeline:

[source,groovy]
----
[1, 2, 3].each { println it }
----

For a long time in Scripted Pipeline, this simply did not work as users would
expect it. Originally filed as
link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-26481[JENKINS-26481] in 2015,
it became one of the most voted for, and watched, tickets in the entire issue
tracker until it was ultimately fixed earlier this year.

[quote, Original bug description by Daniel Tschan]
____
At least some closures are executed only once inside of Groovy CPS DSL scripts
managed by the workflow plugin.
____

At a high level, what has been confusing for many users is that Scripted
Pipeline looks like a Groovy, it quacks like a Groovy, but it's not _exactly_
Groovy. Rather, there's an custom Groovy interpreter
(link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-cps-plugin[CPS]) that executes the
Scripted Pipeline in a manner which provides the durability/resumability that
defines Jenkins Pipeline.

Without diving into too much detail, refer to the pull requests linked to
JENKINS-26481 for that, the code snippet above was particularly challenging to
rectify inside the Pipeline execution layer. As one of the chief architects for
Jenkins Pipeline, Jesse made a number of changes around the problem in 2016,
but it wasn't until early 2017 when Andrew, working on Declarative Pipeline,
started to identify a number of areas of improvement in CPS and provided
multiple patches and test cases.


As luck would have it, combining two of the sharpest minds in the Jenkins
project resulted in the "Small Matter of Programming" being finished, and
released in May of this year with plugin:workflow-cps[Pipeline: Groovy] 2.33.


Please join me in congratulating, and thanking, Andrew and Jesse for their
diligent and hard work smashing one of the most despised bugs in Jenkins
history :).
