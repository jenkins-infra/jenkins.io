Technical Evangelist at link:https://cloudbees.com[CloudBees].

There are less than three weeks left until
link:https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsworld/home[Jenkins World 2017].
Like last year, I'll be at the
"link:/blog/2017/08/03/jenkinsworld-ask-the-experts/[Ask the Experts]"
booth to answer questions about all things Jenkins.
In preparation, I've started a continuing series of quick tutorial videos that answer
some of the most common questions I've seen asked in the community forums.
These  are by no means exhaustive - they're basic answers, which we can build upon.
Each video give a takes a simple example, shows how to create a working solution,
and includes links in the description to related Jenkins documentation pages.

I hope you find them useful.  Look for more of them coming soon!
