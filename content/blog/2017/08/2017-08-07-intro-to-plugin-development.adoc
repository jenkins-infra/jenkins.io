While developing the "link:https://www.cloudbees.com/intro-plugin-development-workshop[Intro to Plugin Development]"
workshop for Jenkins World 2017, I was impressed by the many Jenkins plugin development videos, tutorials, and guides.
Here are some of my favorite plugin development topics and links.

== Plugin tutorial videos

* Jenkins Online Meetup link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azyv183Ua6U[Plugin Development Part 1 - Basics] - Steven Christou and Jesse Glick
* Jenkins Online Meetup link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAJBKFe8mMo[Plugin Development Part 2 - Web UI] - Daniel Beck and Tom Fennelly
* link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmm06tnZuyY[Writing your third plugin] - Justin Ryan
* link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBUkCQ7LW4c[Jenkins Hackathon session at TNG Technology Consulting] - Kohsuke Kawaguchi

== Plugin tutorial pages

* Tutorial on link:https://jenkins.io/doc/developer/tutorial/[jenkins.io]
** Install a Java Development kit, for example link:https://adoptopenjdk.net/[AdoptOpenJDK 8 or 11]
** Install the latest link:https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[maven release]
** Install your link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Plugin+tutorial#Plugintutorial-SettingupaproductiveenvironmentwithyourIDE[IDE] (I like Netbeans, has the Jenkins/Stapler plugin to make plugin creation as easy as menu:File[New Project > Maven > Jenkins Plugin])
