Recently, we improved the plugin:azure-credentials[Azure Credential plugin] by
adding a custom binding for Azure Credentials which allows you to use an
link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli?toc=%2fazure%2fazure-resource-manager%2ftoc.json[Azure
service principal] (the analog to a service or system account) via  the
Credentials Binding plugin. This means it's now trivial to run Azure CLI
commands from a Jenkins Pipeline. We also recently published the first version
of the plugin:azure-app-service[Azure App Service plugin] which makes it _very_
easy to deploy
link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/web/[Azure Web
Apps] directly from Jenkins Pipeline. While we'll have
much more to discuss in our Jenkins World presentation on
link:https://jenkinsworld20162017.sched.com/event/AK4K/azure-devops-open-source-integrations[Azure
DevOps open source integrations], in this blog post I wanted to share some good
snippets of what is possible today with Jenkins Pipeline and Azure.

First, a simple example using the Azure CLI to list resources in the
subscription:

[pipeline]
----
// Scripted //
node {
    /* .. snip .. */
    stage('Deploy') {
        withCredentials([azureServicePrincipal('principal-credentials-id')]) {
            sh 'az login --service-principal -u $AZURE_CLIENT_ID -p $AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET -t $AZURE_TENANT_ID'
            sh 'az account set -s $AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID'
            sh 'az resource list'
        }
    }
}
// Declarative //
----

[WARNING]
====
`azureServicePrincipal()` cannot be used in Declarative Pipeline until
link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-46103[JENKINS-46103] is
resolved.
====

Once a Pipeline can interact with Azure, there are countless ways one could
implement continuous delivery with Jenkins and Azure. From a deploying a simple
webapp with the
link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/annoucing-jenkins-deploy-to-azure-app-service-plugin-and-new-managed-disk-support-for-azure-storage-plugin/[Azure
App Service plugin] and the `azureWebAppPublish` step, or a more advanced
container-based delivery pipeline to deliver new containers to
link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-service/kubernetes/container-service-tutorial-kubernetes-deploy-cluster[Kubernetes
via Azure Container Service].

With the plugin:docker-workflow[Docker Pipeline plugin] and a little bit of
extra scripting, a Jenkins Pipeline can also build and publish a Docker
container to an
link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/[Azure
Container Registry]:

[pipeline]
----
// Scripted //
import groovy.json.JsonSlurper

node {
    def container
    def acrSettings

    withCredentials([azureServicePrincipal('principal-credentials-id')]) {
        stage('Prepare Environment') {
            sh 'az login --service-principal -u $AZURE_CLIENT_ID -p $AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET -t $AZURE_TENANT_ID'
            sh 'az account set -s $AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID'
            acrSettings = new JsonSlurper().parseText(
                                            sh(script: "az acs show -o json -n my-acr", returnStdout: true))
        }

        stage('Build') {
            container = docker.build("${acrSettings.loginServer}/my-app:${env.BUILD_ID}")
        }

        stage('Publish') {
            /* https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-46108 */
            sh "docker login -u ${AZURE_CLIENT_ID} -p ${AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET} ${acrSettings.loginServer}"
            container.push()
        }

        stage('Deploy') {
            echo 'Orchestrating a new deployment with kubectl is a simple exercise left to the reader ;)'
        }
    }
}
// Declarative //

If you have been following our
link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/tag/jenkins/[Azure Blog], you may
have noticed we have shipped a **lot** of updates to provide better support for
Azure on Jenkins, and vice versa, such as:

* **Hosted Jenkins**. New
link:https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/azure-oss.jenkins[Solution
Template] in Azure Marketplace lets you spin up a
Jenkins Controller on Azure in minutes. Not only is it easy and fast, the solution
template gives you option to scale up by selecting the VM disk type and size.
And guess what? You can even select the Jenkins release type you want to use -
LTS, weekly build or Azure verified - all under your control.

* **Continuous integration experience**. In the latest version of our
  plugin:azure-vm-agents[Azure VM Agents plugin], we improved the user
  experience and added the option to let you to select Managed Disk for disk
  type (which is currently used extensively on
  link:https://ci.jenkins.io[ci.jenknis.io]. You no longer need to worry about
  exceeding the number of VMs on your subscription.

* **Continuous deployment experience**. Now, if
Azure CLI is not your cup of tea, we released our first plugin to provide
continuous deployment support to Azure App Service. The plugin supports all
languages Azure App Service supports. We even have a walkthrough
link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/jenkins/deploy-jenkins-app-service-plugin[here] in the
brand new Jenkins Hub where you can find all Jenkins on Azure resources.

* **Pipeline readiness**. Also, all Azure plugins are and will be pipeline ready.
Have you been leveraging our
plugin:windows-azure-storage[Azure Storage plugin] in your Pipeline?

So, whatâ€™s next? We have a big surprise in store at Jenkins World! :)

We are serious about supporting open source and the open source community.
