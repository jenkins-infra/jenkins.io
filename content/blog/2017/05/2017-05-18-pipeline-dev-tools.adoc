I've only been working with Pipeline for about a year.
Pipeline in and of itself has been a huge improvement over old-style Jenkins projects.
As a developer, it has been so great be able work with Jenkins Pipelines
using the same tools I use for writing any other kind of code.

I've also found a number of tools that are super helpful specifically
for developing pipelines. Some were easy to find like the
link:/doc/book/pipeline/getting-started#built-in-documentation[built-in documentation]
and the
link:/doc/book/pipeline/getting-started#snippet-generator[Snippet Generator].
Others were not as obvious or were only recently released.
In this post, I'll show how a few of those tools make working with Pipelines
even better.


== The Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor

The best way to start this list is with the most recent and coolest
arrival in this space: the Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor.  The editor only works
with Declarative Pipelines, but it brings a sleek new user experience to writing
Pipelines.  My recent screencast, released as part of the Blue Ocean Launch,
gives good sense of how useful the editor is:

== Command-line Pipeline Linter

One of the neat features of the Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor is that it does basic
validation on our Declarative Pipelines before they are even committed or Run.
This feature is based on the
link:/doc/book/pipeline/development#linter[Declarative Pipeline Linter]
which can be accessed from the command-line even if you don't have Blue Ocean
installed.

When I was working on the
link:/blog/2017/02/10/declarative-html-publisher[Declarative Pipeline: Publishing HTML Reports]
blog post, I was still learning the declarative syntax and I made a lot lot of mistakes.
Getting quick feedback about the whether my Pipeline was in a sane state made writing that blog much easier.
I wrote a simple shell script that would run my Jenkinsfile through the Declarative Pipeline Linter.

.pipelint.sh - Linting via HTTP POST using `curl`
[source,bash]
----
# curl (REST API)
# User
JENKINS_USER=bitwisenote-jenkins1

# Api key from "/me/configure" on my Jenkins instance
JENKINS_USER_KEY=--my secret, get your own--

# Url for my local Jenkins instance.
JENKINS_URL=http://$JENKINS_USER:$JENKINS_USER_KEY@localhost:32769 # <1>

# JENKINS_CRUMB is needed if your Jenkins master has CRSF protection enabled (which it should)
JENKINS_CRUMB=`curl "$JENKINS_URL/crumbIssuer/api/xml?xpath=concat(//crumbRequestField,\":\",//crumb)"`
curl -X POST -H $JENKINS_CRUMB -F "jenkinsfile=<Jenkinsfile" $JENKINS_URL/pipeline-model-converter/validate

<1> This is not secure.  I'm running this locally only.
See link:/doc/book/managing/cli[Jenkins CLI] for details on how to do this securely.

With this script, I was able to find the error in this this Pipeline without
having to take the time to run it in Jenkins: (Can you spot the mistake?)

[source, groovy, linenums]
----
#!groovy

pipeline {
  agent any

  options {
    // Only keep the 10 most recent builds
    buildDiscarder(logRotator(numToKeepStr:'10'))
  }
  stages {
    stage ('Install') {
      steps {
        // install required bundles
        sh 'bundle install'
      }
    }
    stage ('Build') {
      steps {
        // build
        sh 'bundle exec rake build'
      }

      post {
        success {
          // Archive the built artifacts
          archive includes: 'pkg/*.gem'
        }
      }
    }
    stage ('Test') {
      step {
        // run tests with coverage
        sh 'bundle exec rake spec'
      }

      post {
        success {
          // publish html
          publishHTML target: [
              allowMissing: false,
              alwaysLinkToLastBuild: false,
              keepAll: true,
              reportDir: 'coverage',
              reportFiles: 'index.html',
              reportName: 'RCov Report'
            ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
  post {
    always {
      echo "Send notifications for result: ${currentBuild.result}"
    }
  }
}

When I ran my `pipelint.sh` script on this pipeline it reported this error:

[source]
----
$ pipelint.sh

                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed

Errors encountered validating Jenkinsfile:

       ^

       stage ('Test') {

Doh. I forgot the "s" on `steps` on line 35. Once I added the "s" and ran
`pipelint.sh` again, I got an all clear.

$ pipelint.sh

This didn't mean there weren't other errors, but for a two second smoke test I'll take it.

== Replay

I love being able to use source control to track changes to my Pipelines
right alongside the rest of the code in a project.  There are also times,
when prototyping or debugging, that I need to iterate quickly on a series
of possible Pipeline changes.
The Replay feature let's me do that and see the results,
without committing those changes to source control.

When I wanted to take the previous Pipeline from `agent any` to using Docker via
the `docker { ... }` directive, I used the Replay feature to test it out:

. Selected the previously completed run in the build history
+
image::/doc/book/resources/pipeline/replay-previous-run.png[Previous Pipeline Run]
+
. Clicked "Replay" in the left menu
+
image::/doc/book/resources/pipeline/replay-left-bar.png[Replay Left-menu Button]
+
. Made modifications and click "Run". In this example, I replaced `any` with the `docker { ... }` directive.
+
image::/doc/book/resources/pipeline/replay-modified.png[Replay Left-menu Button]
+
. Checked the results of changes looked good.

Once I worked any bugs out of my Pipeline,
I used Replay to view the Pipeline for the last run and copy it back to my
`Jenkinsfile` and create a commit for that change.

== Conclusion

This is far from a complete list of the tools out there for working with Pipeline.
There are many more and the number is growing.
For example, one tool  I just recently heard about and haven't had a chance to delve into
is the
link:https://github.com/lesfurets/JenkinsPipelineUnit[Pipeline Unit Testing Framework],
which promises the ability to test Pipelines before running them.
It's been a fun year and I can't wait to see what the next year holds for Pipeline.
