At Jenkins World last month, we continued the tradition of "lunch-time demos"
in the Jenkins project's booth which we started in 2016.  We invited a number
of Jenkins contributors to present brief 10-15 minute demos on something they
were working on, or considered themselves experts in. Continuing the
post-Jenkins World tradition, we also just hosted a "Jenkins Online Meetup"
featuring a selection of those lunch-time demos.

If you have ever tried developing Pipeline Libraries, you may have noticed how
long it takes to deploy a new version to server to discover just another syntax
error. I will show how to edit and test Pipeline libraries locally before
committing to the repository (with Configuration-as-Code and Docker).
