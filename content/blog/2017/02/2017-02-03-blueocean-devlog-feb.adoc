With only a couple of months left before

1.0, which is planned for the end of March, I have

some of the good work being finished up by the developers hacking on Blue
Ocean.

This week was a grab bag of important behind-the-scenes features and finalising
the preview of the editor. The merge of the SCM API changes also made it in.
The editor has the new sheets style of editing (there will be blogs and more on
this in the next few weeks):

Some highlights:

- Fix to async loading of resources like translations, so screens don't
  "flash" when they are loaded (i18n improvement)
- Links in notifications can be configured to point to classic or
  Blue Ocean screens
- Time reporting works better when browser clock is out of sync with
  server
- SECURITY-380 was backported into a small fix for those that aren't
  running the latest LTS (but you should ideally be running it)
- SCM API changes finally landed - this will be in beta 22 which should
  hit the update centers soon. This should make things work better with
  GitHub rate limits.
- Beta 21 was released
- The editor reached "preview" release state ready for use with the newly
  announced link:/doc/pipeline/tour/hello-world[Declarative Pipeline] stuff.

Also, a reference to Australian pop culture had to be removed, sadly.

Up Next:

- Some cosmetic changes around headers to make it much nicer and clearer
- Favorite improvements
- GitHub Org-based Pipeline creation
- Editor available in the general update center
- Beta 22 with SCM improvements and no more GitHub rate limit hassles
- Many fixes
- Improvements to the Acceptance Test Harness to reduce the number of false-positives.


Enjoy!
