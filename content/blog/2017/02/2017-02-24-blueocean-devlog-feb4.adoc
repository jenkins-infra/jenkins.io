We're counting down the weeks until link:/projects/blueocean[Blue Ocean] 1.0.

a dev log last week, so I will make up for it this week.

In the last 10 days, 2 betas went out: b22 and b23, and a preview release of
the editor. We expect the next release will be named a release candidate (we
know there is still more to go in, but want to signal that things are getting
into the final stages!). The
link:https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#jenkinsci_blueocean-plugin:gitter.im[Gitter chat room] is
getting busier, so join in!

Also last week, the Blue Ocean Pipeline Editor was presented at the
link:https://www.meetup.com/Jenkins-online-meetup/[Jenkins Online Meetup],
embedded below.

=== Feature Highlights

* You can now create Pipelines from GitHub in Blue Ocean. Either one
  Pipeline at a time, or let it discover all your Pipelines for a GitHub Organization.

* When you press the "Create" button, it will open the new creation flow
  by default now; the feature was previously hidden behind a feature switch.
* You can filter the activity screen by branch! That way you can see a
  history of Pipeline runs for just one branch.

* If you like long names for stages - it now won't pollute the screen
  when space is at a premium (truncated names on screen).
* Blue Ocean events (link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/sse-gateway-plugin[SSE]) should now work on Microsoft Edge again
* You can see durations when you hover the mouse over indicators

Up next:

* A release candidate is expected soon
* Integration work with the Editor to save to branches
* Some updates to the design around tables
* Bundling of the Editor with Blue Ocean


Don't forget, there is also a Blue Ocean Docker image published weekly with
usually the latest released version. If you have Docker installed, this can
be as simple as:

[source]
----
docker run -p 8080:8080 jenkinsci/blueocean*
----

Then browse to link:http://localhost:8080/blue[localhost:8080/blue] - possibly
the quickest way to try things.


Enjoy!
