**Declare Your Pipelines!**
link:/blog/2017/02/03/declarative-pipeline-ga/[Declarative Pipeline 1.0 is here]!
This is the third post in a series showing some of the cool features of
link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#declarative-pipeline[Declarative Pipeline].


In the
link:/blog/2017/02/10/declarative-html-publisher/[previous post],
we converted a Scripted Pipeline to a Declarative Pipeline, adding descriptive stages
and `post` sections.  In one of those `post` blocks, we included a placeholder for
sending notifications.

In this blog post, we'll repeat what I did in
"link:/blog/2016/07/18/pipeline-notifications/[Sending Notifications in Pipeline]
but this time in Declarative Pipeline.
First we'll integrate calls to notification services Slack, HipChat, and Email into our Pipeline.
Then we'll refactor those calls into a single Step in a Shared Library, which
we'll reuse as needed, keeping our `Jenkinsfile` concise and understandable.

== Setup

The setup for this post is almost the same as
link:/blog/2017/02/10/declarative-html-publisher/[my previous Declarative Pipeline post].
I've used a new branch in
link:https://github.com/bitwiseman/hermann[my fork] of the
link:https://github.com/reiseburo/hermann[Hermann project]:
link:https://github.com/bitwiseman/hermann/tree/blog/declarative/notifications[`blog/declarative/notifications`].
I'd already set up a Multibranch Pipeline and pointed it at my repository,
so the new branch will be picked up and built automatically.

I still have my notification targets (where we'll send notifications) that I created for the
"link:/blog/2016/07/18/pipeline-notifications/[Sending Notifications in Pipeline]" blog post.
Take a look at that post to review how I setup the
plugin:slack[Slack],
plugin:hipchat[HipChat],
and plugin:email-ext[Email-ext]
plugins to use those channels.


== Adding Notifications

We'll start from the same Pipeline we had at the end of the previous post.

This Pipeline works quite well, except it doesn't print anything at the start of
the run, and that final `always` directive only prints a message to the console log.
Let's start by getting the notifications working like we did in the original post.
We'll just copy-and-paste the three notification steps (with different parameters)
to get the notifications working for started, success, and failure.

        // send to HipChat

== Moving Notifications to Shared Library

This new Pipeline works and our Declarative Pipeline sends notifications; however,
it is extremely ugly. In the original post using Scripted Pipeline,
I defined a single method that I called at both the start and end of the pipeline.
I'd like to do that here as well, but Declarative doesn't support creating methods
that are accessible to multiple stages.
For this, we'll need to turn to
link:/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/[Shared Libraries].

Shared Libraries, as the name suggests,
let Jenkins Pipelines share code instead of copying it to each new project.
Shared Libraries are not specific to Declarative; they were released in their
current form several months ago and were useful in Scripted Pipeline.
Due to Declarative Pipeline's lack of support for defining methods,
Shared Libraries take on a vital role.  They are the only supported way within
Declarative Pipeline to define methods or classes that we want to use in more than one stage.

[NOTE]
====
The lack of support for defining methods that are accessible in multiple stages,
is a known issue, with at least two JIRA tickets:
link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-41335[JENKINS-41335] and
link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-41396[JENKINS-41396].
For this series, I chose to stick to using features that are fully supported
in Declarative Pipeline at this time.
The internet has plenty of hacked together solutions that *happen to work today*,
but I wanted to highlight current best practices and dependable solutions.

=== Setting up a Shared Library

I've created a simple shared library repository for this series of posts, called
link:https://github.com/bitwiseman/jenkins-pipeline-shared[jenkins-pipeline-shared].
The shared library functionality has too many configuration options to cover in one post.
I've chosen to configure this library as a "Global Pipeline Library,"
accessible from any project on my Jenkins master.
To setup a "Global Pipeline Library," I navigated to "Manage Jenkins" -> "Configure System"
in the Jenkins web UI.
Once there, under "Global Pipeline Libraries", I added a new library.
I then set the name to `bitwiseman-shared`, pointed it at my repository,
and set the default branch for the library to `master`,
but I'll override that in my `Jenkinsfile`.

image::/images/post-images/2017-02-15/shared-library.png[Global Pipeline Library, role="center", width=800]

=== Moving the Code to the Library

Adding a Step to a library involves creating a file with the name of our Step,
adding our code to a `call()` method inside that file,
and replacing the appropriate code in our `Jenkinsfile` with the new Step calls.
Libraries can be set to load "implicitly,"
making their default branch automatically available to all Pipelines,
or they can be loaded manually using a `@Library` annotation.
The branch for implicitly loaded libraries can also be overridden using the `@Library` annotation.

The minimal set of dependencies for `sendNotifications` means we can
basically copy-and-paste the code from the original blog post.
We'll check this change into a branch in the library named
`blog/declarative/notifications`, the same as my branch in the `hermann` repository.
This will let us make changes on the master branch later without breaking this example.
We'll then use the `@Library` directive to tell Jenkins to use that branch's version
of the library with this Pipeline.

<1> The `_` here is intentional.

such as `@Library` must be applied to an element.
That is often a `using` statement, but that isn't needed here so by convention we use an `_`.

== Conclusion
In this post we added notifications to our Declarative Pipeline.
We wanted to move our repetitive notification code into a method;
however, Declarative Pipeline prevented us from defining a method in our `Jenkinsfile`.
Instead, with the help of the Shared Library feature,
we were able to define a `sendNotifications` Step that we could call from our `Jenkinsfile`.
This maintained the clarity of our Pipeline and will let us easily reuse this Step in other projects.
I was pleased to see how little the resulting Pipeline differed from where we started.
The changes were restricted to the start and end of the file with no reformatting elsewhere.

In the next post, we'll cover more about shared libraries and how to
run Sauce OnDemand with xUnit Reporting in Declarative Pipeline.
