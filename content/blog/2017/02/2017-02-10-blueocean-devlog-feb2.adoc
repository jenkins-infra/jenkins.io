We're counting down the weeks until

1.0, which is planned for the end of March. If you hadn't picked up on the hint
in my
link:/blog/2017/02/03/blueocean-devlog-feb/[previous post],
most of the Blue Ocean development team is in Australia, where it is currently
the middle of summer. As I write this it is about 1000 degrees outside.
Emergency measures such as air-conditioning and beer have been deployed in
order to continue Blue Ocean development.

This week featured a new beta with the
link:/blog/2017/02/06/scm-api-2-take2/[SCM API]
changes; many bug fixes, and some version bumps went out in beta 22. We also
got some fresh new designs coming soon, though not in time for beta 22.

Some development highlights:

- Beta 22 went out featuring the new

  with better use of GitHub API rate limits.
- A fix for publishing of
  plugin:pubsub-light[Server Side Events]
  that made one CPU spin up to 100% was fixed (not good unless you want to heat up
  your room)
- Some new refinements to the design merged to the master branch (see images below).
- Beta 22 featured the 1.0 version of
  link:/blog/2017/02/03/declarative-pipeline-ga/[Declarative Pipeline]
- An
  link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/blueocean-plugin/commit/99524c36afedfb11150ac20d26c6b1d4e01b714a[Australian translation]
  was added; really critical stuff, I know..
- The Acceptance Test Harness (ATH) was stabilised a bit and it now covers
  creating Pipelines from Git, which we talked about in
  link:/blog/2017/01/27/blueocean-dev-log-jan4/[late January].
- The plugin:blueocean-pipeline-editor[Visual Pipeline Editor] was released to the main Update Center
  as a preview release, ready to play with!
- Some small performance improvements


I'm looking forward to those fancy new designs making their way into an
upcoming release too.

Lovely! Hopefully you see more green than I do...

Anyways, up next for Blue Ocean:

- Creation of Pipelines from GitHub, including auto-discovery of new Pipelines.
- Closer to a "release candidate"
- Working on filtering the activity view for "per branch" views
- Better reporting of durations of stages, steps, and runs


Enjoy!
