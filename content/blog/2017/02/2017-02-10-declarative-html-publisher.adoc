**Declare Your Pipelines!**
link:/blog/2017/02/03/declarative-pipeline-ga/[Declarative Pipeline 1.0 is here]!
This is the second post in a series showing some of the cool features of
link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#declarative-pipeline[Declarative Pipeline].

In the
link:/blog/2017/02/07/declarative-maven-project/[previous blog post],
we created a simple Declarative Pipeline.
In this blog post, we'll go back and look at the Scripted Pipeline for the
link:/blog/2016/07/01/html-publisher-plugin/[Publishing HTML Reports in Pipeline] blog post.
We'll convert that Pipeline to Declarative syntax (including `properties`), go
into more detail on the `post` section, and then we'll use the `agent`
directive to switch our Pipeline to run in Docker.

== Setup

For this post, I'm going to use the
link:https://github.com/bitwiseman/hermann/tree/blog/declarative/html[`blog/add-declarative/html`]
branch of
link:https://github.com/bitwiseman/hermann[my fork] of the
link:https://github.com/reiseburo/hermann[hermann project].
I've set up a Multibranch Pipeline and pointed it at my repository
the same as did it previous post.
Also the same as before, I've set this Pipeline's Git configuration to
automatically "Clean after checkout".

This time we already have a Pipeline checked in.
I'll run it a few times to get a baseline.

== Converting to Declarative

Let's start by converting the Scripted Pipeline straight to Declarative.

[pipeline]
----
// Declarative //
pipeline {
  agent any // <1> // <2>
  options {
    // Keep the 10 most recent builds
    buildDiscarder(logRotator(numToKeepStr:'10')) // <3>
  }
  stages {
    stage ('Build') { // <4>
      steps {
        // install required gems
        sh 'bundle install'

        // build and run tests with coverage
        sh 'bundle exec rake build spec'

        // Archive the built artifacts
        archive includes: 'pkg/*.gem'

        // publish html
        publishHTML target: [
            allowMissing: false,
            alwaysLinkToLastBuild: false,
            keepAll: true,
            reportDir: 'coverage',
            reportFiles: 'index.html',
            reportName: 'RCov Report'
          ]
      }
    }
  }
}
// Scripted //
properties([[$class: 'BuildDiscarderProperty',
                strategy: [$class: 'LogRotator', numToKeepStr: '10']]]) // <3>

node { // <1>
  stage ('Build') { // <4>

    // Checkout
    checkout scm // <2>

    // install required gems
    sh 'bundle install'

    // build and run tests with coverage
    sh 'bundle exec rake build spec'

    // Archive the built artifacts
    archive includes: 'pkg/*.gem'

    // publish html
    publishHTML [
        allowMissing: false,
        alwaysLinkToLastBuild: false,
        keepAll: true,
        reportDir: 'coverage',
        reportFiles: 'index.html',
        reportName: 'RCov Report'
      ]

  }
}
----
<1> Select where to run this Pipeline, in this case "any" agent, regardless of label.
<2> Declarative automatically performs a checkout of source code on the agent,
    whereas Scripted Pipeline users must explicitly call `checkout scm`.
<3> Set the Pipeline option to preserve the ten most recent runs.
This overrides the default behavior from the Multibranch parent of this Pipeline.
<4> Run the "Build" stage.

Now that we have this Pipeline in Declarative form, let's take a minute to do a
little clean up.  We'll split out the `bundle` actions a little more and move
steps into logically grouped stages.  Rather than having one monolithic "Build"
stage, we'll have details for each stage.  As long as we're prettying things
up, let's switch to using link:/projects/blueocean/[Blue Ocean] to view our
builds, as well.

[pipeline]
----
// Declarative //
pipeline {
  agent any
  options {
    // Keep the 10 most recent builds
    buildDiscarder(logRotator(numToKeepStr:'10'))
  }
  stages {
    stage ('Install') {
      steps {
        // install required gems
        sh 'bundle install'
      }
    }
    stage ('Build') {
      steps {
        // build
        sh 'bundle exec rake build'

        // Archive the built artifacts
        archive includes: 'pkg/*.gem'
      }
    }
    stage ('Test') {
      steps {
        // run tests with coverage
        sh 'bundle exec rake spec'

        // publish html
        publishHTML target: [
            allowMissing: false,
            alwaysLinkToLastBuild: false,
            keepAll: true,
            reportDir: 'coverage',
            reportFiles: 'index.html',
            reportName: 'RCov Report'
          ]
      }
    }
  }
}
// Scripted //

== Using `post` sections

This looks pretty good, but if we think about it
the `archive` and `publishHTML` steps are really post-stage actions.
They should only occur when the rest of their stage succeeds.
As our Pipeline gets more complex we might need to add actions that always happen
even if a stage or the Pipeline as a whole fail.

In Scripted Pipeline, we would use `try-catch-finally`,
but we cannot do that in Declarative.
One of the defining features of the Declarative Pipeline
is that it does not allow script-based control structures
such as `for` loops, `if-then-else` blocks, or `try-catch-finally` blocks.
Of course, internally Step implementations can still contain whatever conditional logic they want,
but the Declarative Pipeline cannot.

Instead of free-form conditional logic,
Declarative Pipeline provides a set of Pipeline-specific controls:
link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#when[`when` directives], which we'll look at in
a later blog post in this series, control whether to execute the steps in a stage,
and
link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#post[`post` sections]
control which actions to take based on result of a single stage
or a whole Pipeline.  `post` supports a number of
link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#post-conditions[run conditions],
including `always` (execute no matter what) and `changed`
(execute when the result differs from previous run).
We'll use `success` to run `archive` and `publishHTML` when their respective stages complete.
We'll also use an `always` block with a placeholder for sending notifications,
which I'll implement in the next blog post.

  agent any

    // Only keep the 10 most recent builds
    buildDiscarder(logRotator(numToKeepStr:'10'))

        // install required gems

            ]
        }
      }
    }

  post {
    always {
      echo "Send notifications for result: ${currentBuild.result}"
    }
  }
}

== Switching `agent` to run in Docker

`agent` can actually accept
link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#agent-parameters[several other parameters] instead of `any`.
We could filter on `label "some-label"`, for example,
which would be the equivalent of `node ('some-label')` in Scripted Pipeline.
However, `agent` also lets us just as easily switch to using a Docker container,
which replaces a more complicated set of changes in Scripted Pipeline:

////
Since this is a partial, non-copyable, Declarative Pipeline it shouldn't use
[pipeline] so it's not presented as a Jenkinsfile
////
[source,groovy]
----
pipeline {
  agent {
    // Use docker container
    docker {
      image 'ruby:2.3'
    }
  }
  /* ... unchanged ... */
}
----

If I needed to, I could add a `label` filter under `docker`
to select a node to host the Docker container.
I already have Docker available on all my agents, so I don't need `label` -
this works as is.
As you can see below, the Docker container spins up at the start of the run
and the pipeline runs inside it.  Simple!

== Conclusion

At first glance, the Declarative Pipeline's removal of control structures seems
like it would be too constrictive.  However, it replaces those structures with
facilities like the `post` section, that give us reasonable control over the
flow our our Pipeline while still improving readability and maintainability.
In the next blog post, we'll add notifications to this pipeline
and look at how to use Shared Libraries with Declarative
Pipeline to share code and keep Pipelines easy to understand.
