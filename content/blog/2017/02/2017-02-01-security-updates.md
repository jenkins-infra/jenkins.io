We just released security updates to Jenkins, versions 2.44 and 2.32.2, that fix a high severity and several medium and low severity issues.

For an overview of what was fixed, see the [security advisory](/security/advisory/2017-02-01/).
For an overview on the possible impact of these changes on upgrading Jenkins LTS, see our [LTS upgrade guide](/doc/upgrade-guide/2.32/#upgrading-to-jenkins-lts-2-32-2).
I strongly recommend you read these documents, as there are a few possible side effects of these fixes.
