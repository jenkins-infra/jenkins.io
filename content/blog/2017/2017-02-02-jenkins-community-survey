State of Jenkins - 2016 Community Survey

Last fall, prior to Jenkins World, CloudBees conducted a Community Survey on behalf of the Jenkins community. We received over 1200 responses  – and thanks to this input, we 
have some interesting insights into what Jenkins users are doing.

Based on the results, it’s safe to say that Jenkins is currently viewed as the #1, Continuous Integration (CI) server and is rapidly becoming the leading Continuous Delivery (CD) tool. Jenkins 2, which introduced Pipeline-as-code and the Pipeline plugin as core to Jenkins, has skyrocketed to being adopted by nearly half Jenkins users.  Other data remained consistent with findings year to year. For example, the number of Jenkins users continues to increase, and 90% of survey respondents still consider Jenkins mission-critical.

Here are some of the key findings:

The overwhelming majority of respondents, 85% indicated that Jenkins usage had increased. Diving a little deeper, for organizations with more than 50 software projects, almost 30% used Jenkins in 2016 as compared to 16% in 2012
An astounding 46% of respondents were running Jenkins 2, eight months after its release. This matches December 2016 stats from Jenkins.io showing 55% of installs are running are running Jenkins 2.
Adoption of Jenkins Pipeline for continuous delivery (CD) is accelerating. Respondents who have adopted CD reported that 54% are using Pipeline.
The push to production has stayed about the same from last year, 61% of respondents are deploying changes to production at least once per week 
Linux is the platform of choice for builds, favored by 85% of respondents, along with 85% choosing Git as the favored source code repository 
Half of respondents are deploying applications directly to the cloud, with Amazon Web Services as the favored platform.d
