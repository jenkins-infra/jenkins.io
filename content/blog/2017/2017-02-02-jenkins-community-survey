Last fall, prior to Jenkins World, CloudBees conducted a link:https://jenkins.io/blog/2016/09/09/take-the-2016-jenkins-survey-blog/[Community Survey on behalf of the Jenkins community]. We received over 1200 responses  â€“ and thanks to this input, we 
have some interesting insights into what Jenkins users are doing.

Based on the results, Jenkins is increasingly being used to support continuous delivery (CD). Jenkins 2, which introduced Pipeline-as-code and the Pipeline plugin as core to Jenkins, has skyrocketed to being adopted by nearly half Jenkins users.  Other data remained consistent with findings year to year. For example, the number of Jenkins users continues to increase, and 90% of survey respondents still consider Jenkins mission-critical.

Here are some of the key findings:

* 85% of respondants indicated that Jenkins usage had increased
* 30% of organizations with more than 50 software projects used Jenkins in 2016 as compared to 16% in 201
* An impressive 46% of respondents were running Jenkins 2, eight months after its release 
* Adoption of Jenkins Pipeline for continuous delivery (CD) is accelerating. Respondents who have adopted CD reported that 54% are using Pipeline.
* 61% of respondents are deploying changes to production at least once per week 
* Linux is the platform of choice for builds, favored by 85% of respondents
* 85% of respondants use Git as the source code repository 
* Half of respondents are deploying applications directly to the cloud, with Amazon Web Services as the favored platform

We want to thank everyone for completing the survey - and congrats to Iker Garcia for winning a free pass to Jenkins World 2017 and to Dave Leifer for winning the Amazon gift card.
