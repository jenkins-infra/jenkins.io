NOTE: This is a speaker blogpost for a DevOps World | Jenkins World 2019 talk in Lisbon, Portugal

With Halloween upon us, there's no better time to discuss Jenkinstein!
Are you suffering from Jenkins performance issues?
Are users complaining about a slow UI or even scarier, is Jenkins going down frequently?

We'll be discussing how you can forecast for growth, and baseline using key performance indicators like application throughput and latency, by analyzing spooky data like Garbage Collection logs!
