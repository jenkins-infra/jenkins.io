=== JSON Schema and VSCode
With the new JSON Schema being enabled developers can now test their yaml file against it. The new schema checks for the configurators, their types and to a certain extent the nesting of the configurators. VSCode allows us to test out the schema right out of the box with some modifications.

=== Steps to Enable the Schema Validation

a)The first step includes installing the YAML plugin from redhat. Open up the Extension list in VSCode editor using `Ctrl + Shift + X`.

b)Select and install the YAML plugin by Red Hat. Reload the editor if necessary.

c)The next step includes inserting the JSON Schema inside the VSCode workspace. We would be including the schema in the `work` directory.

d)Spin up your Jenkins server and navigate to `/configuration-as-code/jsonSchema`. 

e)Copy and paste this schema into a new file called `json.schema`.

f)In order to enable validation we need to include it in the workspace settings. In order to do that
navigate to `File` and then `Preference` and then `Settings`. Inside settings search for `json` and inside `settings.json` include the following configuration.

[source, json]

---
{
"yaml.schemas": {
        "schema.json": "\*.yml"
    }
}
 ---

You can specify a glob pattern as the value for schema.json which is the file name for the shema. This would apply the schema to all yaml files.

g)The following tasks can be done using VSCode:

  a)Auto completion (Ctrl + Space):
    Auto completes on all commands.

  b)Document Outlining (Ctrl + Shift + O):
  Provides the document outlining of all completed nodes in the file.

f)Create a new file under the work directory called `jenkins.yml`. For example consider the following contents for the file:

[source, yaml]
---
jenkins:
 systemMessage: “Hello World”
 numExecutors:2
 ---

g) The above yaml file is valid according to the schema and vscode should provide you with validation and autocompletion for the same.
