== Where to contribute?

The Jenkins project is spread across multiple organizations on GitHub (jenkinsci, jenkins-infra, jenkins-zh).
You are welcome to contribute to **any** repository in **any** of these organizations,
or to any other Jenkins-related repository on GitHub.
If you adopt Jenkins in your own open-source projects (e.g. Jenkins Pipeline or Configuration as Code),
it counts as well! Some useful queries:
