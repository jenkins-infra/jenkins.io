On November 3rd, 2018 the Jenkins User Conference China (JUCC) met Jenkins users in Shenzhen which is the most burgeoning city in China.
It was the first time to hold JUCC in Shenzhen.
We held JUCC along with DevOps International Summit, which is the biggest DevOps event in China.
More than 200 attendees gathered at JUCC Shenzhen to share and discuss Jenkins, DevOps, Continuous Delivery, Pipeline, and Agile.
