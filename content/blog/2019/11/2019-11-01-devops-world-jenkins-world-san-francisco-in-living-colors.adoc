link:https://www.cloudbees.com/devops-world/san-francisco[DevOps World | Jenkins World San Francisco] was August 12 - 15, 2019.
The event was delivered in vivid colors starting with flowing banners hung from street lamp posts to the big screens in breakout rooms, to the expo hall.
The energy and enthusiasm in the Moscone convention center made the colors even more vibrant, thanks to the people attending the conference.

Here's a recap of the conference in pictures:

== DevOps Superheroes

Even though the conference offered endless learning and networking possibilities, and major milestones worth celebrating,  I felt the true highlight of the conference was the celebration of each individual, “You”.
“You” are the super hero, the driving force behind the incredible innovations to advance technology to where it is today.
Here’s celebrating the super heroes in all of YOU!
