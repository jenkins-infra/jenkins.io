I often find myself needing to run the same actions on a bunch of different configurations.  
Up to now, that meant I had to make multiple copies of the same stages in my pipelines. 
When I needed to make changes, I had to make the same changes in multiple places throughout my pipeline.
Maintaining even a small number of configuration was difficult for larger pipelines.

Declarative Pipeline 1.5.0-beta1 (now available from the
link:https://updates.jenkins.io/experimental/[Jenkins Experimental Update site]) adds a new `matrix` section that lets me specify a list stages once and then run that same list in parallel on multiple configurations. 
Let's take a look!

== Single configuration pipeline

I'll start with a simple pipeline with build and test stages.  
I'm using `echo` steps as placeholders for my build and test actions.

.Jenkinsfile
[source, groovy]
----
pipeline {
    agent none
    stages {
        stage('BuildAndTest') {
            agent any
            stages {
                stage('Build') {
                    steps {
                        echo 'Do Build'
                    }
                }
                stage('Test') {
                    steps {
                        echo 'Do Test'
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

== Pipeline for multiple platforms and browsers

I'd like to run my build and tests on a combination of platforms and browsers. 
The new `matrix` directive lets me specify a set of `axes`. 
Each `axis` has a `name` and a list of one or more `values`.
When the pipeline is run, Jenkins will take those and run my stages on all possible combinations of values from each axis.
All cells in a matrix run in parallel (limited only by the number of available agents).  
Stages within each cell are run sequentially.

My matrix has two axes: `PLATFORM` and `BROWSER`.
I have three values for `PLATFORM` and four values for `BROWSER` resulting in my stages being run with twelve different combinations.
I've changed my `echo` steps to use the axis values for each cell.

.Jenkinsfile
[source, groovy]
----
pipeline {
    agent none
    stages {
        stage('BuildAndTest') {
            matrix {
                agent any
                axes {
                    axis {
                        name 'PLATFORM'
                        values 'linux', 'windows', 'mac'
                    }
                    axis {
                        name 'BROWSER'
                        values 'firefox', 'chrome', 'safari', 'edge'
                    }
                }
                stages {
                    stage('Build') {
                        steps {
                            echo "Do Build for ${PLATFORM} - ${BROWSER}"
                        }
                    }
                    stage('Test') {
                        steps {
                            echo "Do Test for ${PLATFORM} - ${BROWSER}"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

== Excluding invalid combinations

Now that I have my basic matrix created, I've noticed that I have some invalid combinations.  
Microsoft Edge only runs on Windows and there isn't a Linux version of Safari. 

I can remove invalid cells from my matrix using `exclude` directives. Each `exclude` has one or more `axis` directives with `name` and `values`.  
The `axis` directives inside an `exclude` generate a set of combinations (similar to generating the matrix cells). 
The matrix cells that match all the values from an `exclude` combination are removed from the matrix. 
If I have more than one `exclude` directive, each are evaluated separately to remove cells.

When dealing with a long lists of values to exclude, I can use `notValues` instead of `values` to specify axis values we *don't* want excluded.
Yes, that's a double negative, so it can get a little confusing.
I try to use it only when I really need it. 

In my sample pipeline below, I specifically exclude the `linux, safari` combination and I also exclude any platform that is *not* `windows` with the `edge` browser.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This pipeline uses two axes but there is *no limit* on the number of `axis` directives. 

Also, in this pipeline each `exclude` specifies values for both axes, but that is not required.
If we wanted to run only "linux" cells, we could use the following `exclude`:

exclude {
    axis {
        name 'PLATFORM'
        notValues 'linux'
    }
}

== Controlling cell behavior at runtime

Inside the `matrix` directive I can also add "per-cell" directives. 
These are the same directives that I would add to a `stage` and they let me control the behavior of each cell in the matrix.
These directives can use the axis values from their cell as part of their inputs, allowing me to customize the behavior of each cell to match its axis values. 

On my Jenkins server I have configured agents with labels that match the OS for each agent ("linux-agent", "windows-agent", and "mac-agent"). 
To run each cell in my matrix on the appropriate operating system, I configure the label for that cell using Groovy string templating. 

[source, groovy]
----
matrix {
    axes { ... }
    excludes { ... }
    agent {
        label "${PLATFORM}-agent"
    }
    stages { ... }
    // ...
}
----

Occasionally I run my pipeline manually from the Jenkins Web UI. 
When I do that, I'd like to be able to select just one platform to run.
The `axis` and `exclude` directives define the static set of cells that make up the matrix. 
That set of combinations is generated before the start of the run, before any parameters are processed. 
What this means is that I can't add or remove cells from a matrix after the job has started.

The "per-cell" directives, on the other hand, are evaluated at runtime. 
I can use the "per-cell" `when` directive inside `matrix` to control which cells in the matrix are executed.
I'll add a `choice` parameter with the list of platforms, and add conditions to the `when` directive, which will either let all platforms execute, or only execute cells that match my selected platform.

[source, groovy]
----
pipeline {
    parameters {
        choice(name: 'PLATFORM_FILTER', choices: ['all', 'linux', 'windows', 'mac'], description: 'Run on specific platform')
    }
    agent none
    stages {
        stage('BuildAndTest') {
            matrix {
                agent {
                    label "${PLATFORM}-agent"
                }
                when { anyOf {
                    expression { params.PLATFORM_FILTER == 'all' }
                    expression { params.PLATFORM_FILTER == env.PLATFORM }
                } }
                axes {
                    axis {
                        name 'PLATFORM'
                        values 'linux', 'windows', 'mac'
                    }
                    axis {
                        name 'BROWSER'
                        values 'firefox', 'chrome', 'safari', 'edge'
                    }
                }

                    exclude {

                            name 'PLATFORM'
                            values 'linux'
                        }
                        axis {
                            name 'BROWSER'
                            values 'safari'
                        }
                    }
                    exclude {
                        axis {
                            name 'PLATFORM'

                        }
                    }
                }
                stages {
                    stage('Build') {
                        steps {
                            echo "Do Build for ${PLATFORM} - ${BROWSER}"
                        }
                    }
                    stage('Test') {
                        steps {
                            echo "Do Test for ${PLATFORM} - ${BROWSER}"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

If I run this Pipeline from the Jenkins UI and set the `PLATFORM_FILTER` parameter to `mac`, I'll get something like the output below:

I'll go over what's been added to Pipeline in the last year (including matrix) and discuss ideas about where pipeline should go next.

== Conclusion 

In this blog post, we've looked at how to use the `matrix` directive to make concise but powerful declarative pipelines.  
An equivalent pipeline created without `matrix` would easily be several times larger, and much harder to understand and maintain. 

Matrix is now available from the experimental update center. 
It will be released to the main update center as soon as we're done putting the finishing touches on the documentation and online help.
