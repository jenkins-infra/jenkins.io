== Voter Registration

This is the first time in a while that we are running a Jenkins election; we are learning as we go.
Jenkins elections aim to be very inclusive.
We do not restrict elections to just code committers.
Anyone who has a Jenkins account registered before September 1, 2019 is eligible to vote.
Jenkins, being the successful project it is, has  approximately 100 000 accounts that meet that criteria.
As a result we are contacting eligible voters and requesting that they explicitly ‘opt-in’ to participate in the voting.

If you meet the criteria, you will receive an email at your registered jenkins.io email address.
It will be from \elections@jenkins.io with the title ‘*2019 Jenkins Election - Invitation to Participate*’.
The email will provide election details and will include an "*I want to participate*" button.

== Voter Confirmation

Once you click on the link, you should see a confirmation screen as follows:

If you do not receive the email by November 14, 2019 or if you have any problems voting, please comment on the link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/INFRA-2319[Jenkins Election 2019 Jira issue].

== Voting

The voting will officially open on November 11, 2019.
Candidates will receive an email from the Condorcet internet voting sent by Kohsuke Kawaguchi.
One email will be sent for each vote (so 3 in total: 1 for board, 1 for event officer and 1 for security officer).
The vote will ask to rank the candidates using a screen like this:

Thank you very much for all the candidates showing the Jenkins spirit of service to their community.
We encourage everyone to register to vote and participate in the Jenkins community.

== Uncontested Officer Positions

When an officer position has only one candidate that is willing to accept the nomination, there is no reason to vote on that position.
The individual becomes an officer as the sole candidate for the position.

Uncontested officers include:

|==================================================
|Name           |Role
|Olivier Vernin |Infrastructure Officer
