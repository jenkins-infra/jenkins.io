Managing any software presents its own unique challenges. Jenkins controllers are no exception. For example,

* How do you keep a finger on the pulse of everything going on in your Jenkins environment? Are you looking at every new defect opened in the issue tracker?
* How do you make sure that your controllers or agents don’t silently fail? Are you monitoring its logs? All of its internal components? If something does go wrong, how do you fix it??
* How do you avoid the infamous “angry Jenkins” logo?

That’s why we created Jenkins Health Advisor by CloudBees. 

Here at https://www.cloudbees.com?utm_medium=blog&utm_source=jenkins.io&utm_campaign=cloudbees-jenkins-advisor-plugin[CloudBees], we have years of experience https://www.cloudbees.com/products/cloudbees-jenkins-support?utm_medium=blog&utm_source=jenkins.io&utm_campaign=cloudbees-jenkins-advisor-plugin[supporting our customers who are using Jenkins], including our proprietary products build on top of Jenkins like https://www.cloudbees.com/products/cloudbees-core?utm_medium=blog&utm_source=jenkins.io&utm_campaign=cloudbees-jenkins-advisor-plugin[CloudBees Core]. 
As a result, our support team is made up of automation experts with Jenkins knowledge you can’t get anywhere else. 

Automated health checks started when our support engineers created a platform so they could write rules to detect known issues on https://plugins.jenkins.io/support-core[support bundles] provided by our customers, and redirect them to the required knowledge source to diagnose and resolve the issue. 

After years of internal usage we decided to share this service with the community and we are pleased to introduce **a new free  (as in beer) service available to every Jenkins user**: **https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-health-advisor?utm_medium=blog&utm_source=jenkins.io&utm_campaign=cloudbees-jenkins-advisor-plugin[Jenkins Health Advisor by CloudBees]**.
