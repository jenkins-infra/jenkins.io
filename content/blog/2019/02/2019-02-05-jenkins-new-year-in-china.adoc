At the time of the Spring Festival. I want to make a summary of some activities in the last year. 
You might already notice that more and more Chinese contributors emerge in the Jenkins community. 
We have a GSoC champion who is link:https://github.com/cizezsy[Shenyu Zheng]. 
He is a great example for other students. With the effort of three skilled engineers, 
many Jenkins users could learn the edge technologies and useful use cases. 
They co-organized several Jenkins Meetups in a couple of cities in China.

There are two workshops about Jenkins and Jenkins X in the DevOps International Summit. link:https://github.com/rawlingsj[James Rawlings] gave us a wonderful view of the Jenkins X. Many people start to know this project. The link:https://jenkins-x.io/zh/[Chinese website of jx] would be helpful to those people.

On November 3rd, 2018 the link:/blog/2019/01/09/jenkins-user-conference-china-shenzhen-update/[Jenkins User Conference China(JUCC)] was hosted in Shenzhen. More than 200 attendees gathered at JUCC to share and discuss Jenkins, DevOps, Continuous Delivery, Pipeline, and Agile.

There was a Jenkins workshop to teach users to develop a plugin in October. It was during the Hacktoberfest 2018. So some people got a beautiful T-shirt at this meetup. We'll keep this event in 2019. I hope more users and developers could join us.

Thank you all folks. And other friendly contributors.

Chinese is our main communication language. A large number of the Jenkins users are not a proficient English speaker. 
So letting most of Chinese Jenkins users could easily use Jenkins as their CI/CD platform is the final mission of link:https://jenkins.io/sigs/chinese-localization/[Chinese Localization SIG]. 
You can find three participants on the page. But that's not the link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/cn.jenkins.io/graphs/contributors[full list]. 
More exciting thing is that link:https://github.com/alauda[Alauda] giving a big support which as a startup company.

WeChat is the greatest social media channel in China. WeChat has one billion users. 
Almost everyone in China has a WeChat account. It must be a perfect place to publish articles and events. 
There are over 1k people subscribed the link:https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=Mzg2MzAwNzU3Nw==&mid=2247483664&idx=1&sn=fa3fb0171d999d345105ce17f8175be7[Jenkins official WeChat Subscription Account] in the last three months.

In the new year, I'm looking forward to growing up with you all!
