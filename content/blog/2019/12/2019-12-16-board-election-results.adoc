== Board election details

The link:https://civs.cs.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/results.pl?id=E_570327cde7f6c9fc[voting results] are:

1. **link:https://github.com/oleg-nenashev[Oleg Nenashev]** (Condorcet winner: wins contests with all other choices)
2. link:https://github.com/MarkEWaite[Mark Waite]  loses to Oleg Nenashev by 181–127
3. **link:https://github.com/uhafner[Ullrich Hafner]**  loses to Oleg Nenashev by 198–115, loses to Mark Waite by 171–133
4. **link:https://github.com/slide[Alex Earl]**  loses to Oleg Nenashev by 225–82, loses to Ullrich Hafner by 168–128
5. link:https://github.com/olivergondza[Oliver Gondža]  loses to Oleg Nenashev by 227–76, loses to Alex Earl by 151–136
6. link:https://github.com/LinuxSuRen[Zhao Xiaojie (aka Rick)]  loses to Oleg Nenashev by 233–82, loses to Oliver Gondža by 160–131

Although Mark Waite came second in the voting results, being on the board would violate the link:/project/board-election-process/#corporate-involvement[Corporate Involvement clause] which states that "the number of board members affiliated with one company must be less than 50%".
Based on that rule, the third seat link:https://github.com/slide[Alex Earl] will join the Jenkins board.
At the same time, link:https://github.com/MarkEWaite[Mark Waite] will take the newly introduced role of link:/project/team-leads/#documentation[Documentation officer].

All new board members are elected for a 2-year term, unless they step down earlier.
The estimated end of term for them is December 02, 2021.
The actual date will depend on the election schedule in 2021.

== Officer election details

We have reelected all 5 officers for the new 1-year term, with the estimated end of term on Dec 02, 2020.

* link:https://github.com/alyssat[Alyssa Tong] won the biggest support as an Events officer (link:https://civs.cs.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/results.pl?id=E_6267ca0d4a8e90c6[voting results])
* link:[Daniel Beck] won the biggest support as a Security officer (link:https://civs.cs.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/results.pl?id=E_9d72d0e7b04414c7[voting results])

When an officer position has only one candidate that is willing to accept the nomination, there is no reason to vote on that position.
This year some nominees declined the nominations before the election happened, and 3 officer nominations were finally uncontested: 
link:https://github.com/olblak[Olivier Vernin] - link:/project/team-leads/#infrastructure[infrastructure officer],
link:https://github.com/ogondza[Oliver Gondža] - link:/project/team-leads/#release[release officer],
link:https://github.com/MarkEWaite[Mark Waite] - link:/project/team-leads/#documentation[documentation officer].

=== Statistics

Here are some voting stats from these elections:

* Total number of eligible accounts: 91,015
* Total number of registered voters: 831
* Total number of votes: 343

This election was hosted on the link:https://civs.cs.cornell.edu/[Condorcet Internet Voting Service (CIVS)].
While preparing for the elections, we discovered that CIVS is unable to support our large number of eligible voters.
We created a link:/blog/2019/11/08/board-elections/[voter registration system] to identify voters and then registered those voters with CIVS.
The workaround required a slight voting delay.
Special thanks to link:https://github.com/olblak[Olivier Vernin] and link:https://github.com/tracymiranda[Tracy Miranda] who made it possible!


=== What's next for the board?

In short term, the renewed board will focus on running the Jenkins governance processes (meetings, budget approvals, funding, etc.) and defining next steps towards improving the project.
One of the priorities will be to organize knowledge and permission transfers to new board members so that they can be effective in their new roles.
There are also pending activities like Jenkins' transition to link:https://cd.foundation/[Continuous Delivery Foundation] which require attention from board members.

For longer term, there are some ideas floating around:
  roadmap for key components,
  long-anticipated architecture changes (UX revamp, pluggable storage, cloud native Jenkins),
  adopting Linux Foundation best practices like link:https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/[Core Infrastructure Initiative],
  contributor onboarding,
  etc.
Such initiatives are instrumental for further evolvement of the Jenkins project,
and the board could help to facilitate them in the community.
The ideas will be discussed in link:/mailing-lists/[mailing lists] and during governance meetings.
If you would like to share your vision and ideas about what's needed in the project,
it is definitely a great time to do so!
