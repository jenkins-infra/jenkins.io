Today we published link:/security/advisory/2019-04-03/[a security advisory] that mostly informs about issues in Jenkins plugins that have _no fixes_.
What's going on?

The Jenkins security team triages link:/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities[incoming reports both to Jira and our non-public mailing list].
Once we've determined it is a plugin not maintained by any Jenkins security team members, we try to inform the plugin maintainer about the issue, offering our help in developing, reviewing, and publishing any fixes.
Sometimes the affected plugin is unmaintained, or maintainers don't respond in a timely manner to the notifications or the followup emails we send.

In such cases, we publish link:/security/#vulnerabilities-in-plugins[security advisories informing users about these issues, even if there's no new release with a fix].
Doing so allows administrators to make an informed decision about the continued use of plugins with unresolved security vulnerabilities.
Today's advisory is overwhelmingly such an advisory.
