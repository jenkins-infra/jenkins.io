We are a little over two months away from the largest Jenkins gathering of the year.  From Jenkins users, to maintainers, contributors, mentors and those new to Jenkins this event will have something for everyone.

This year’s link:https://www.cloudbees.com/devops-world/san-francisco[**DevOps World - Jenkins World 2019 San Francisco**] has moved to a larger venue to facilitate the growth. From August 12 - 15, 2019 the event will take place at the Moscone West Center.  The event boasts 100+ sessions, and will offer training, hands-on workshops, onsite certification, contributor summit and much more.  Conference attendees can expect to be inspired while learning the latest innovations from industry leaders. Attendees will learn the value that digital transformation has in delivering software more efficiently, more quickly and with higher quality.

We are excited to announce most of the agenda for DevOps World Jenkins World San Francisco is now live. We will continue to fill out the agenda with more sessions, trainings/workshops, and activities. Below is a small sampling of sessions from some of our favorite Jenkins contributors:

=== Jenkins Configuration as Code: try it & start contributing! - link:https://github.com/ewelinawilkosz[Ewelina Wilkosz]

link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin[Jenkins Configuration as Code] is an open source Jenkins plugin that allows users to keep complete Jenkins configuration in a simple configuration file (yaml format). In the talk, I'll briefly present the history of the plugin, the vision for the future and current status. Then I'll move to the demo section where I'll show how easy it is to configure and run Jenkins with the help of the plugin.

=== Thinking about Jenkins Security - link:https://github.com/MarkEWaite[Mark Waite & Wadeck Follonier]

Jenkins security concepts, authorization, authentication and auditing, secure builds, agent security, configuration and administration security, auditing, and security best practices.

=== Docker and Jenkins [as Code] - link:https://github.com/oleg-nenashev[Dr. Oleg Nenashev]

The Configuration as Code plugin is a new milestone which enables managing Jenkins configurations via YAML. Together with Docker, this plugin offers many ways to produce ready-to-fly Jenkins images for any environments. In my talk, I will describe official master and agent images offered by the Jenkins project. What’s inside them? How do you configure images with JCasC and Groovy hooks? How do you use these approaches together? And, finally, how do you simplify packaging of custom Jenkins images and define the entire system [as code]?

=== Can Jenkins be the Engine of Mobile DevOps? - link:https://github.com/shashikantjagtap[Shashikant Jagtap]

In this talk, we will explore the following topics:

*  How mobile DevOps is different than web DevOps
*  Challenges in mobile DevOps ( iOS and Android)
*  How Jenkins fits in mobile DevOps and CI/CD pipelines
*  What Jenkins misses for mobile
*  How we can make Jenkins better for mobile apps

=== Creating a CI/CD Pipeline for Your Shared Libraries - link:https://github.com/roderickrandolph[Roderick Randolph]

At Capital One we run tens of thousands of CI/CD pipelines on Jenkins, leveraging the Jenkins Pipeline shared libraries extension to enable code reuse and decrease time to market for dev teams. A code change to our shared library goes live immediately and is consumed the next time a team triggers their project's pipeline. So, why do we have such high confidence that a code change to our library won't break a team's pipeline? The answer: we've developed a fully automated CI/CD pipeline for our shared library.

During this talk, you will learn how to create a fully automated pipeline for your shared libraries including how to develop tests, create canary releases, monitor for issues and quickly rollback changes to your shared library to achieve rapid delivery while minimizing any impact on dev teams.

=== How Jenkins Builds and Delivers Jenkins in the Cloud - link:https://github.com/bbenz[Brian Benz] & link:https://github.com/rtyler[Tyler Croy]

Want to know how Jenkins builds Jenkins? Catch this session to see the real-life implementation of Jenkins’ development (at ci.jenkins.io) and delivery infrastructure in the cloud as it evolved from a mix of platforms to multi-platform VMs, containers and Kubernetes on Microsoft Azure.  Expect a frank discussion of issues that were encountered along the way, how the architecture has evolved and what’s on the roadmap.  We’ll share important tips and tricks for implementing your own Jenkins infrastructure on any cloud, based on Jenkins’ own implementation experience.

=== Declarative Pipeline 2019: Tips, Tricks and What's Next - link:https://github.com/bitwiseman[Liam Newman]

Are you using Declarative Pipeline? Are you considering using them? Are you just curious? Well, we're going to help you get more out of Declarative Pipeline with less complexity and less effort. We'll walk through some best practices, point out some tricks you might not have known, warn you off some common mistakes, review what's changed in the last year and give you a preview of what we're working on for Declarative Pipeline going forward.

=== Say Goodbye to Hello World, Say Hello to Real World Delivery Pipelines - link:https://github.com/bbenz[Brian Benz] & link:https://github.com/jldeen[Jessica Deen]

Are you tired of "Hello World" and hypothetical demos? So are we! In this code-heavy, deeply technical session, you’ll learn more than just tips and tricks.  You’ll learn best practices and how to start from absolute zero. Whether you’re using Jenkins, Azure DevOps, a mixture of the two, or another CI/CD tool, you’ll learn how to create multiple build and release pipelines using real world code hosted on open source platforms such as GitHub.
