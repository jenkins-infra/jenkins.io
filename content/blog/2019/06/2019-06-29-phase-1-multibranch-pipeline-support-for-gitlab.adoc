= Multi-branch Pipeline Support for GitLab SCM

This is one of the Jenkins project in GSoC 2019. We are working on adding support
for link:/projects/gsoc/2019/gitlab-support-for-multibranch-pipeline/[Multi-branch
Pipeline Jobs and Folder Organisation in GitLab]. The plan is to create the following
plugins:

* link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/gitlab-api-plugin[GitLab API Plugin] - Wraps GitLab Java APIs.

* link:https://github.com/baymac/gitlab-branch-source-plugin[GitLab Branch Source Plugin] - Contains two packages:

** `io.jenkins.plugins.gitlabserverconfig` - Manages server configuration and web hooks management. 
Ideally should reside inside another plugin with name `GitLab Plugin`. In future, this package should 
be moved into a new plugin.

** `io.jenkins.plugins.gitlabbranchsource` - Adds GitLab Branch Source for Multi-branch Pipeline Jobs (including
Merge Requests) and Folder organisation.

== Present State

* FreeStyle Job and Pipeline(Single Branch) Job are fully supported.

* Multi-branch Pipeline Job is partially supported (no MRs detection).

* GitLab Folder Organisation is not supported.

== Goals of this project

* Implement a lightweight GitLab Plugin that depends on GitLab API Plugin.

* Follow convention of 3 separate plugins i.e. `GitLab Plugin`, `GitLab API Plugin`, `GitLab Branch Source Plugin`.

* Implement GitLab Branch Source Plugin with support for Multi-branch Pipeline Jobs.

* Support new Jenkins features such as
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin[Jenkins Code as Configuration] (JCasC),
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/incrementals-tools/[Incremental Tools].

* Clear & Efficient design.

* Support new SCM Trait APIs.

* Support Java 8 and above.

== Building the plugin

No binaries are available for this plugin as the plugin is in the very early alpha stage, and not ready for the general
public quite yet.  If you want to jump in early, you can try building it yourself from source.

=== Installation:

* Checkout source code to your local machine:

[source, bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/baymac/gitlab-branch-source-plugin.git

cd gitlab-branch-source-plugin
----

* Install the plugin:
    
[source, bash]
----
mvn clean install 

mvn clean install -DskipTests # to skip tests
----

* Run the plugin:

[source, bash]
----
mvn hpi:run # runs a Jenkins instance at localhost:8080

mvn hpi:run -Djetty.port=<port> # to run on your desired port number 
----

If you want to test it with your Jenkins server, after `mvn clean install` follow these steps in your Jenkins instance:

. Select `Manage Jenkins`

. Select `Manage Plugins`

. Select `Advanced` tab

. In `Upload Plugin` section, select `Choose file`

. Select `$<root_dir>/target/gitlab-branch-source.hpi`

. Select `Upload` 

. Select `Install without restart`
    
== Usage

Assuming plugin installation has done been already.

=== Setting up GitLab Server Configuration on Jenkins

. On jenkins, select `Manage Jenkins`

. Select `Configure System`

. Scroll down to find the `GitLab` section
+
image:/images/post-images/2019/06/2019-06-29-multibranch-pipeline-support-for-gitlab/gitlab-section.png[gitlab-section]
+
. Select `Add GitLab Server` | Select `GitLab Server`

. Now you will now see the GitLab Server Configuration options.
+
image:/images/post-images/2019/06/2019-06-29-multibranch-pipeline-support-for-gitlab/gitlab-server.png[gitlab-server]
+
There are 4 fields that needs to be configured:
    
** `Name` - Plugin automatically generates an unique server name for you. User may want to configure this field
to suit their needs but should make sure it is sufficiently unique. We recommend to keep it as it is.
    
** `Server URL` - Contains the URL to your GitLab Server. By default it is set to "https://gitlab.com". User can
modify it to enter their GitLab Server URL e.g. https://gitlab.gnome.org/, http://gitlab.example.com:7990. etc.

** `Credentials` - Contains a list of credentials entries that are of type GitLab Personal Access Token. When
no credential has been added it shows "-none-". User can add a credential by clicking "Add" button.

** `Web Hook` - This field is a checkbox. If you want the plugin to setup a webhook on your GitLab project(s)
related jobs, check this box. The plugin listens to a URL for the concerned GitLab project(s) and when an event
occurs in the GitLab Server, the server sends an event trigger to the URL where the web hook is setup. If you
want continuous integration (or continuous delivery) on your GitLab project then you may want to automatically
set it up.
     
. Adding a Personal Access Token Credentials (To automatically generate Personal Access Token see
link:#creating-personal-access-token-within-jenkins[next section]):

.. User is required to add a `GitLab Personal Access Token` type credentials entry to securely persist the token
inside Jenkins.

.. Generate a `Personal Access Token` on your GitLab Server:

... Select profile dropdown menu from top-right corner

... Select `Settings`

... Select `Access Token` from left column

... Enter a name | Set Scope to `api`,`read_user`, `read_repository`

... Select `Create Personal Access Token`

... Copy the token generated
    
.. Return to Jenkins | Select `Add` in Credentials field | Select `Jenkins`

.. Set `Kind` to GitLab Personal Access Token

.. Enter `Token`

.. Enter a unique id in `ID`

.. Enter a human readable description

.. Select `Add`
+
image:/images/post-images/2019/06/2019-06-29-multibranch-pipeline-support-for-gitlab/gitlab-credentials.png[gitlab-credentials]
+
. Testing connection:

.. Select your desired token in the `Credentials` dropdown

.. Select `Test Connection`

.. It should return something like `Credentials verified for user <username>`

. Select `Apply` (at the bottom)

. GitLab Server is now setup on Jenkins

=== Creating Personal Access Token within Jenkins

Alternatively, users can generate a GitLab Personal Access Token within Jenkins itself and automatically add the
GitLab Personal Access Token credentials to Jenkins server credentials. 

. Select `Advanced` at the bottom of `GitLab` Section

. Select `Manage Additional GitLab Actions`

. Select `Convert login and password to token`

. Set the `GitLab Server URL`

. There are 2 options to generate token;

.. `From credentials` - To select an already persisting Username Password Credentials or add an Username Password
credential to persist it.

.. `From login and password` - If this is a one time thing then you can directly enter you credentials to the text boxes
and the username/password credential is not persisted.
    
. After setting your username/password credential, select `Create token credentials`.

. The token creator will create a Personal Access Token in your GitLab Server for the given user with the
required scope and also create a credentials for the same inside Jenkins server. You can go back to the GitLab Server
Configuration to select the new credentials generated (select "-none-" first then new credentials will appear). For
security reasons this token is not revealed as plain text rather returns an `id`. It is a 128-bit long UUID-4 string
(36 characters).

=== Configuration as Code

No need for messing around in the UI. `Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasC)` or simply `Configuration as Code` Plugin
allows you to configure Jenkins via a `yaml` file. If you are a first time user, you can learn more about JCasC
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin[here].

==== Add configuration YAML:

There are multiple ways to load JCasC yaml file to configure Jenkins: 

* JCasC by default searches for a file with the name `jenkins.yaml` in `$JENKINS_ROOT`.

* The JCasC looks for an environment variable `CASC_JENKINS_CONFIG` which contains the path
for the configuration `yaml` file.

** A path to a folder containing a set of config files e.g. `/var/jenkins_home/casc_configs`.

** A full path to a single file e.g. `/var/jenkins_home/casc_configs/jenkins.yaml`.
    
** A URL pointing to a file served on the web e.g. `https://<your-domain>/jenkins.yaml`.

* You can also set the configuration yaml path in the UI. Go to `<your-jenkins-domain>/configuration-as-code`.
Enter path or URL to `jenkins.yaml` and select `Apply New Configuration`.

An example of configuring GitLab server via `jenkins.yaml`:

[source, yaml]
----
credentials:
  system:
    domainCredentials:
      - credentials:
          - gitlabPersonalAccessToken:
              scope: SYSTEM
              id: "i<3GitLab"
              token: "XfsqZvVtAx5YCph5bq3r" # gitlab personal access token

unclassified:
  gitLabServers:
    servers:
      - credentialsId: "i<3GitLab"
        manageHooks: true
        name: "gitlab.com"
        serverUrl: "https://gitlab.com"

link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin#handling-secrets[section] in JCasC 
documentation.

== Future Scope of work

The second phase of GSoC will be utilized to develop GitLab Branch Source. The new feature is a work in progress, but
the codebase is unstable and requires lot of bugfixes. Some features like Multibranch Pipeline Jobs are functioning
properly. More about it at the end of second phase. 

== Issue Tracking

This project uses Jenkins link:https://issues.jenkins.io/[JIRA] to track issues. You can file issues under
`gitlab-branch-source-plugin` component.
