Jenkins turns 15 years old!
Jenkins World brings together DevOps thought leaders, IT executives, continuous delivery practitioners and the Jenkins
community and ecosystem in one global event, providing attendees with the opportunity to learn, explore, network
face-to-face and help shape the next evolution of Jenkins development and solutions for DevOps.

There is also the Jenkins Contributor Summit in San Francisco. The Jenkins Contributor Summit is the place where
current and future contributors get together to discuss, learn and collaborate on the latest and greatest efforts within
Jenkins project. The morning portion of the summit is a mix of presentations by the core contributors. The
presentations highlight what each effort is about and what community members can do to help. In the
afternoon breakout sessions with  Birds of a Feather tables for in-depth discussion, and collaboration with sub-project
contributors.

I feel very honored to have been a part of this.

==== Day 1
Day one started with the contributor summit. This was a chance for everyone to get together and talk about
contributions and put faces to names. Most people I had only met via video chat or on gitter so I was super excited.
We gathered to hear about the start of the Jenkins open source landscape.

Next up was the BoF/Unconference. I was leading these sessions and I felt they went really well.
We had fellow org admins Martin d'Anjou and Jeff Pearce give a talk about Google Summer of Code projects.

Google Summer of Code student Natasha Stopa presented her project, Plugin Installation Manager Library/CLI Tool. This is
a super cool project and very well received in the community.

We closed out the session with a presentation from Steven Terrana from Booz Allen Hamilton and the awesome Jenkins
Templating Engine. If you have not had a chance to try this, please make sure you do at https://github.com/boozallen/jenkins-templating-engine.

This was a really cool experience and gave me a chance to hear about things the community is working on and help with
issues they are facing.
There were a range of questions from Jenkins X to many of the plugins I maintain such and the Jenkins Prometheus and the
Sysdig Secure Scanning plugins.
There were also a lot of Kubernetes questions. There is a lot of marketing data regarding the increased usage of
Kubernetes but I was seriously surprised by the massive interest in Jenkins on Kubernetes.
Of course there were opportunities for selfie requests.

Lunch time demos got underway and we had a busy schedule.
First up was the awesome Mark Waite to talk about the
link:https://www.slideshare.net/markewaite/git-for-jenkins-faster-and-better[Git plugin]. A lot of people use git in
Jenkins.
Thank you so much for all that you do Mark.

Jenkins org admin Martin d'Anjou was next on deck to talk about the Google Summer of Code. So amazing to think that the
Google Summer of Code is also in its 15th year like Jenkins!

Natasha Stopa is a Google Summer of Code student and she presented her project Plugin Installation Manager Library/CLI Tool.
Natasha really put a lot of hard work in to this plugin and it was really awesome to see the turn out and support during
her presentation.

Right after the lunch time demos I also oversaw the Jenkins open space. This was an opportunity for the community to talk
about items and let them flow organically. I really enjoyed this session and felt it was also well received.
