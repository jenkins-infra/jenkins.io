I am Long Nguyen from link:https://international.fpt.edu.vn/[FPT University], Vietnam. My project for Google Summer of Code 2019 is link:/projects/gsoc/2019/remoting-over-apache-kafka-docker-k8s-features/[Remoting over Apache Kafka with Kubernetes features]. After a successful link:/blog/2019/07/11/remoting-kafka-kubernetes-phase-1/[Phase 1], finally the 2.0 version of the plugin has been released. The 2.0 version provides seamless integration with Kubernetes environment.

== 2.0 version features

* Start a simple Apache Kafka server in Kubernetes.

* Dynamically provision Remoting Kafka Agent in Kubernetes.

* Helm chart to bootstrap the whole system in Kubernetes.

== Start a simple Apache Kafka server in Kubernetes

Use of the plugin requires that users have a configured Apache Zookeeper and Apache Kafka server, which could be intimidating for people who just want to try out the plugin. Now, users can start a simple, single-node Apache Kafka server in Kubernetes environment with just one button click.

On the Global Configuration page, users can input Kubernetes server information and credentials. When users click `Start Kafka on Kubernetes` button, Jenkins will create a Kubernetes client from the information and then apply Apache Zookeeper and Apache Kafka YAML specification files from `resources`. After downloading images and creating containers, it will automatically update Apache Zookeeper and Apache Kafka URLs into respective fields.

== Dynamically provision Remoting Kafka Agent in Kubernetes

With previous version, users have to manually add/remove nodes so it is hard to scale builds quickly. plugin:kubernetes[Kubernetes plugin] allows us to dynamically provision agents in Kubernetes but it is designed for JNLP agent. With this new version, Remoting Kafka agent can also be provisioned automatically in Kubernetes environment.

Users can find the new feature in Cloud section in `/configure`. Here users could input Kubernetes connection parameters and desired Remoting Kafka agent properties including labels. When new build with matching labels gets started and there are no free nodes, Cloud will automatically provision Remoting Kafka agent pod in Kubernetes to run the build.

== Helm Chart

Helm chart for Remoting over Apache Kafka plugin is based on link:https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/jenkins[stable/jenkins] chart and link:https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/incubator/kafka[incubator/kafka] chart. You can follow the instruction link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting-kafka-plugin/blob/master/README.md[here] to install a demo ready-to-use Helm release. Your `kubectl get all` should look like this:
