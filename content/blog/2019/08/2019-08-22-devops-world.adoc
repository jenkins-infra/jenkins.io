Last week I had the privilege of attending link:https://www.cloudbees.com/devops-world/san-francisco[DevOps World - Jenkins World in San
Francisco] to present link:/projects/gsoc/2019/plugin-installation-manager-tool-cli[my Google Summer of Code project] for plugin management. It was
an amazing experience getting to meet people from all over world who are trying
to make the development and release process easier and more efficient. I enjoyed
learning more about industry tools, processes, and standards, and meeting CI/CD
experts and contributors in the open source community.

Below is a summary of my experience. Thank you to the Jenkins project and CloudBees for making
 my trip and attendance possible!

==== Day 1
Monday was the Continuous Delivery Contributor Summit, which focused on projects
under the CDF umbrella.  After checking in and grabbing my badge, I was able to
meet up with some of the Google Summer of Code org admins. It was great
being able to actually meet them in person after talking to them over video
conferencing and chats all summer!

Tracy Miranda started the summit out by introducing the link:https://cd.foundation/[Continuous Delivery Foundation],
which aims to provide a vendor neutral home to help and sustain open source projects
focusing on all aspects of continuous delivery.  Currently, Jenkins, Tekton, Spinnaker,
and JenkinsX have joined the foundation.  Project updates were given for Jenkins,
Tekton, and JenkinsX.  In the afternoon, attendees split into different groups for
unconference sessions.  I presented my project to the Jenkins group.  Afterwards,
there was free time to chat with other attendees about my project and the other Jenkins
projects. Lastly, lightning talks were given before everyone headed to the contributor
appreciation event to grab some food and drinks.

==== Day 2
I attended the Jenkins Pipeline Fundamentals Short Course in the morning. Even
though I'm working on a project for Jenkins, there's still a lot I don't know so
I just wanted to try to learn more.

A lot of the afternoon sessions filled up, so I spent the afternoon trying to meet
other people at the conference, before heading to the keynote. The keynote
talked more about the CDF and some of the backstory behind its origin.  This year is also a big anniversary for Jenkins - it has now been
around for 15 years.

After the keynote, I checked out a Women in Tech mixer and
the opening of the exibition hall. Probably my favorite swag I picked up was the
"Will Code for Beer" stickers and a bottle of hot sauce.

=== Day 3
The morning began with another keynote. Shawn Ahmed of CloudBees talked about the
challenges of visibility into bottlenecks of the development process and Rajeev Mahajan
discussed how HSBC tackled DevOps.  The rest of the day I attended different sessions
on container tooling, implementing CI/CD in a cloud native environment, running
Jenkins on Jenkins, and database DevOps.

After the sessions finished, I wandered
around the expo until it closed, then joined some of the other conference attendees
to have some fun at a ping pong bar nearby.

=== Day 4
The final and last day of the conference was probably my favorite.  The morning
keynote revealed that link:https://github.com/LinuxSuRen[Zhao Xiaojie] had won an award for his work on Jenkins advocacy,
some other DevOps award panelists talked about their approaches to different challenges,
then David Stanke gave an enjoyable presentation about cloud native CI/CD. I was
able to present my summer project and attend a few more sessions, including one
about DevOps at scale, and another about use cases for machine learning in CI/CD pipelines.

The last keynote given by James Governor was a thoughtful look into the current and
future states of tech. How does tech look like it will scale in the coming years
in the U.S. and across the world? How can we make tech more inclusive and accessible?
What can we do to minimize our environmental footprint?  In particular, his points
on welcoming people from a non-traditional computer science background resonated with
me since I'm currently undergoing my own career transition to tech.

After the conference ended, I said goodbye to the remaining GSoC org admins before
meeting an old friend for dinner and bringing along some new friends I met at the
conference.  I spent the remaining part of the night singing karaoke with
them before heading out of San Francisco the next morning.

Thanks again to everyone who supported me and encouraged me leading up to and during
my presentation, patiently answered my questions as I tried to gather more context
about CI/CD tools and practices, and made my first DevOps conference so enjoyable!
