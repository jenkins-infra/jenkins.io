The template's main repo is at 
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/react-plugin-template[React Plugin Template]

This template is part of the project link:https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6112735123734528[Working Hours UI Improvement] during
link:https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/[Google Summer of Code 2019], which improved the UI of `Working Hours Plugin` using this pattern to develop Jenkins plugins with React. The `Working Hours Plugin` repository can be found at link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/working-hours-plugin[Working Hours Plugin].


== Overview

Developing plugin for Jenkins has always been easy to do with its Jelly based UI render system, but Jelly seems to be pretty heavy when we want to use more modernized frameworks like React, or if we need to make the plugin UI more customized. This is what this template is built for.

And with React integrated, development of Jenkins plugin is more modernized, developer can now use tons of React libraries, the way to use libraries is now tinier and safer with webpack, in short, coding with Jenkins plugin can be much easier.

== Features

[cols="2,8",options="header"]
|=====================================
| Feature               | Summary            
| React Integrated      | React is integrated, you can take full control of the UI
| Using Iframe          | Using iframe can create a new javascript env, we can get rid of some side effects of some polyfills which was added globally.(such as Prototype.js)
| Maven Lifecycle       | npm commands are integrated into Maven lifecycle with help of link:https://github.com/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin/[Frontend Maven Plugin]
| Webpack               | Webpack helps us reduce the size of the bundle, also avoids pollution on the global namespace.
| Jenkins Crumb attached| Crumb is attached to Axios client, now you can send requests in the way you used to do in React.
| Express as devserver  | You can run your react app in a standalone page so you can develop in webpack hot reload mode, also with webpack proxy, the standalone app is still accessible to the jenkins dev server.
| Axios as http client  | Axios hugely simplify the way to make requests.

== Getting Started

Clone the repo:
[source,shell]
---------------------------
git clone https://github.com/jenkinsci/react-plugin-template.git
cd react-plugin-template
---------------------------
Install the Maven dependencies and node modules.
[source,shell]
---------------------------
mvn install -DskipTests
---------------------------

Run standalone React app with hot reload
[source,shell]
---------------------------
npm run start
---------------------------
Run plugin
[source,shell]
---------------------------
mvn hpi:run -Dskip.npm -f pom.xml
---------------------------

== Send HTTP requests

As Crumb Issuer is default enabled in Jenkins and each ajax request is required to contain a `Jenkins Crumb` in request header, so be sure to use the `axiosInstance` which is already set up with `Jenkins Crumb` and exported at `src/main/react/app/api.js`.
[source,javascript]
---------------------------
export const apiGetData = () => {
  return axiosInstance.post("/data");
};
---------------------------
Or if you want to use your own http client, remember to add the `Jenkins Crumb` to your request's header, the Crumb's key and content could be found at `src/main/react/app/utils/urlConfig.js`, then you can set the header like below.

[source,javascript]
---------------------------
const headers = {};
const crumbHeaderName = UrlConfig.getCrumbHeaderName();

if (crumbHeaderName) {
  headers[crumbHeaderName] = UrlConfig.getCrumbToken();
}
---------------------------

=== Write your own request handler

Now you can customize your request pattern as you want, also we need to write a handler.

Jenkins is using stapler to preprocess the requests, so if you need a request handler. For example and also in this template, you can use an `Action` class to create a sub-url, and then a `StaplerProxy` to proxy the request like a router. More info about handlers can be found in the link:https://github.com/stapler/stapler/blob/master/README.md[Stapler Reference].

=== Example handler

ManagementLink would get the request and then hand it off to the `PluginUI`

[source,java]
---------------------------
@Extension
public class PluginManagementLink extends ManagementLink implements StaplerProxy {

    PluginUI webapp;

    public Object getTarget() {
        return webapp;
    }

    public String getUrlName() {
        return "react-plugin-template";
    }
}
---------------------------

`PluginUI`, stapler would then find methods in the target class, in this case, it finds `doDynamic`, then we can choose the next handler by return the methods result, in this case, `getTodos` or `setTodos`, and `PluginUI` just function like a url router.

[source,java]
---------------------------
public class PluginUI{
    public HttpResponse doDynamic(StaplerRequest request) {
        ...

        List<String> params = getRequestParams(request);

        switch (params.get(0)) {
        case "get-todos":
            return getTodos();
        case "set-todos":
            return setTodos(request);
        }
        ...
    }
}
---------------------------

== Data Persistence
You can save your data with a descriptor

[source,java]
---------------------------
@Extension
public class PluginConfig extends Descriptor<PluginConfig> implements Describable<PluginConfig>
---------------------------

And after each time you change data, call `save()` to persist them.
[source,java]
---------------------------
    public void setTodos(
            @CheckForNull List<Todo> value) {
        this.todos = value;
        save();
    }
---------------------------

And in your handler, you can get the config class by calling
[source,java]
---------------------------
config = ExtensionList.lookup(PluginConfig.class).get(0);
---------------------------


== Customize your plugin

=== Be sure to modify all the occurrence of `react-template`

- At `org/jenkinsci/plugins/reactplugintemplate/PluginUI/index.jelly` , change the iframe's id and its source url.
- At `src/main/react/app/utils/urlConfig.js` change 
- At `src/main/react/server/config.js` , change the proxy route.
- At `src/main/react/package.json` , change the start script's BASE_URL
- At `pom.xml` , change the artifactId
- At `org/jenkinsci/plugins/reactplugintemplate/PluginManagementLink.java` , change names.

Also use the `same value` to modify the occurrence in `src\main\react\app\utils\urlConfig.js`.

=== Customize a page for your plugin

A management Link is recommended, which would get your plugin a standalone page, along with a entry button in the `/manage` system manage page.

== How does this template work?

This template is putting a webpack project inside a Maven project, and this template is just chaining the build result by copy the webpack output to the plugin's webapp folder to make it accessible from the iframe, then Jelly render the iframe and the client gets the Plugin UI.

== Why iframe?

Over time, Jenkins has added a lot of various javascript libraries to every regular page, which now causes problems for using modern Javascript tooling and as such, we decided to inline the new react based pages in their own sandbox which prevents collisions with other libraries, and maybe the iframe is a good sandbox case.
