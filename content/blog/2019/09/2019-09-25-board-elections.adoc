Nominations for the 2019 Jenkins Board elections open for three governing board positions and five officer positions, namely: Security, Events, Release, Infrastructure and Documentation.

The terms of office for these positions are:

* Officer positions (1 year): November 4, 2019 to November 3, 2020
* Governing board members (2 years): November 4, 2019 to November 3, 2021

To nominate someone, simply send an email to mailto:jenkinsci-board@googlegroups.com[jenkinsci-board@googlegroups.com] with their name and position you nominate them for. 
Please share any information on why you are making the nomination.
Self nominations are also welcome.

The board positions and officer roles are an essential part of Jenkins' community governance and well-being. 
I highly encourage everyone to consider participating.
