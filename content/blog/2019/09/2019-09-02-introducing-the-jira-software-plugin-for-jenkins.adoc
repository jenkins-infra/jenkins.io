NOTE: This is a guest post by Rafal Myslek from link:https://www.atlassian.com/jira[Atlassian].

According to a link:https://www.atlassian.com/blog/software-teams/modern-software-development-trends[recent survey] we conducted, software & IT teams on average use 4+ tools to move code from development to customer-facing production. As a result, teams struggle with keeping the status of work updated and understanding the overall health of their delivery pipeline.

To solve this problem, I am excited to announce that we built link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/atlassian-jira-software-cloud[an official Jenkins plugin for Jira Software Cloud]. The plugin automatically associates build and deployment information from Jenkins with relevant Jira issues and exposes key information about your pipeline across Jira issues, boards and via JQL. This means you can use Jira Software to automatically update and track issues through your complete development pipeline, from backlog to release.

I hope this plugin adds value to you and your team. If you are interested in contributing or forking this plug-in you can head over to our project on the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/atlassian-jira-software-cloud-plugin[Jenkins GitHub repo to get started].

== Better collaboration between teams

This new information view is so powerful because historically it was dispersed across multiple tools only accessible to a few members of your team. Now anyone involved in the software delivery process can self-serve this information. For example, product managers, QA, and support teams can view which features have been deployed to customers and which are still waiting in staging environments.

With better information sharing between tools in your delivery stack, you can also improve cross-collaboration between teams. Teams such as QA and operations can collaborate in the software teams next sprint. For example, you can use build information in Jira Software to create a workflow between QA and developers and create a rapid feedback loop for testing at any point in your development process.

== Use Jira’s Querying Language for advanced views

In addition to building better ways to collaborate, these integrations also give your team deeper insight into the development pipeline from within Jira Software. You can now create powerful views into your delivery pipeline link:https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/advanced-searching-developer-reference-967312910.html[with JQL queries across multiple connected tools]. For example, you can write a custom JQL query to report all Jira issues that have been deployed to production but still have an open PR.

== Get started

*In Jira Software Cloud*

*Create OAuth credentials in Jira for Jenkins*

. Navigate to *Jira home > Jira settings > Apps*.
. Select *OAuth credentials*.
. Select *Create credentials*.
. Enter the following details:
* _App name_ - Jenkins
* _App logo_ - A URL to the Jenkins logo, which will be used as an icon in the list of credentials. Eg: https://jenkins.yourcompany.com/logo.png
* Server base URL - The URL to your Jenkins server. Eg: https://jenkins.yourcompany.com

*In Jenkins*

*Install the Jenkins plugin*

. Login to your Jenkins server and navigate to the Plugin Manager.

. Select the 'Available' tab and search for 'Atlassian Jira Software Cloud' as the plugin name then install it.
* The open-source plugin is hosted in the Jenkins GitHub account. link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/atlassian-jira-software-cloud-plugin[You can check it out here].

*Set up Jenkins credentials*

. In Jenkins, go to *Manage Jenkins > Configure System* screen and scroll to the Jira Software Cloud integration section.
. Select *Add Jira Cloud Site > Jira Cloud Site*. The _Site name_, _ClientID_, and _Secret_ fields display.
. Enter the following details:
* Site name: The URL for your Jira Cloud site, for example yourcompany.atlassian.net.
* Client ID: Copy from *OAuth credentials* screen (Client ID column).
* Secret: Select Add > Jenkins.
    - For _Kind_, select *Secret text*.
    - For _Secret_, copy from *OAuth credentials* screen (Secret column).
    - For _Description_, provide a helpful description
. Select Test settings to make sure your credentials are valid for your Jira site.

== How to use the plugin

*To start using the integration:*

. Go into a specific pipeline in Jenkins ( Note: Your pipeline must be a 'Multibranch Pipeline' ).
. From the left-hand menu, select *Pipeline Syntax*.
. In the Snippet Generator, select *jiraSendDeploymentInfo* or *jiraSendBuildInfo* from the dropdown list of Sample Steps and fill in the relevant details.
. Select *Generate Pipeline Script* and copy/paste the output into your _Jenkinsfile_ on the relevant Repository you are using. This will be used to notify Jira when you run that pipeline on that repo.

*For sending build information*

This is an example snippet of a very simple ‘build’ stage set up in a _Jenkinsfile_. After the pipeline is run, it will post the build information to your Jira Cloud site by looking at the branch name. If there is a Jira issue key (e.g. “TEST-123”) in the branch name, it will send the data over to Jira.

*Jenkinsfile example*

[source, groovy]
----
pipeline {
     agent any
     stages {
         stage('Build') {
             steps {
                 echo 'Building...'
             }
             post {
                 always {
                     jiraSendBuildInfo site: 'example.atlassian.net'
                 }
             }
         }
     }
 }
----

*For sending deployment information*

This is an example snippet of two stages that run on any change to the staging or master branch. Again, we use a post step to send deployment data to Jira and the relevant issues. Here, the *environmentId*, *environmentName*, and *environmentType* need to be set to whatever you want to appear in Jira.

*Jenkinsfile example*

[source, groovy]
----
pipeline {
     agent any
     stages {
         stage('Deploy - Staging') {
             when {
                 branch 'master'
             }
             steps {
                 echo 'Deploying to Staging from master...'
             }
             post {
                 always {
                     jiraSendDeploymentInfo site: 'example.atlassian.net', environmentId: 'us-stg-1', environmentName: 'us-stg-1', environmentType: 'staging'
                 }
             }
         }
         stage('Deploy - Production') {
            when {
                branch 'master'
            }
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying to Production from master...'
            }
            post {
                always {
                    jiraSendDeploymentInfo site: 'example.atlassian.net', environmentId: 'us-prod-1', environmentName: 'us-prod-1', environmentType: 'production'
                }
            }
         }
     }
 }

The entire _Jenkinsfile_ may look something like this. This is only meant to represent an example of what the Jira snippets could look like within a stage or step.

*Jenkinsfile example*

[source, groovy]
----
pipeline {
     agent any
     stages {
         stage('Build') {
             steps {
                 echo 'Building...'
             }
             post {
                 always {
                     jiraSendBuildInfo site: 'example.atlassian.net'
                 }
             }
         }
         stage('Deploy - Staging') {
             when {
                 branch 'master'
             }
             steps {
                 echo 'Deploying to Staging from master...'
             }
             post {
                 always {
                     jiraSendDeploymentInfo site: 'example.atlassian.net', environmentId: 'us-stg-1', environmentName: 'us-stg-1', environmentType: 'staging'
                 }
             }
         }
         stage('Deploy - Production') {
            when {
                branch 'master'
            }
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying to Production from master...'
            }
            post {
                always {
                    jiraSendDeploymentInfo site: 'example.atlassian.net', environmentId: 'us-prod-1', environmentName: 'us-prod-1', environmentType: 'production'
                }
            }
         }
     }
 }
