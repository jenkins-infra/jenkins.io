We are happy to share that with the latest version of link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/branch-api/[Branch API], you can now view pull request titles directly in Jenkins.

This feature was one of the most requested improvements from our community, and it's great to see it live.
We recently ran a poll on what users want to see on the Jenkins dashboard and this was the number one request.

This update is part of our ongoing effort to migrate features from BlueOcean and revamp the Jenkins experience.
If you’re interested in how we’re shaping Jenkins' future, be sure to check out our link:https://www.devopsworld.com/2024-virtual[DevOps World 2024] talk.

Thanks to everyone involved in getting this shipped.
