The board positions and officer roles are an essential part of the Jenkins project and we are excited to see contributors taking these roles.

The board continues to require that no single company may have a majority on the Jenkins governance board.

== Governance Board election details

This year we had link:/blog/2024/10/03/jenkins-election-candidates/#board-candidates[six candidates] for the Jenkins Governance Board and link:/blog/2024/10/03/jenkins-election-candidates/#officer-candidates[two candidates] for Release Officer.
All of them are awesome community leaders who actively contribute to the Jenkins project and represent its users.

This year elected 3 governance board members, including a replacement for link:/blog/authors/kohsuke/[Kohsuke Kawaguchi] after his many years of service to Jenkins.
We used the https://civs.cs.cornell.edu/[Condorcet Internet Voting Service] that allows voters to rank their choices rather than just picking their one favorite choice.
You can find voting results in the link:https://civs1.civs.us/cgi-bin/results.pl?id=E_f287a2e101977dc8[governance board poll] and the link:https://civs1.civs.us/cgi-bin/results.pl?id=E_4c3443416941563c[release officer poll].

All board members are elected for a 2-year term.
The estimated end of the term for them is December 1, 2026.

== Officer election details

All 5 officer positions were up for election this year.
These roles have a 1-year term, with the estimated end of term on December 1, 2025.
After the initial review of nominations and confirmations with potential candidates, 4 officer positions were uncontested:

* **Alyssa Tong** - link:/project/team-leads/#events[Events Officer]
* **Damien Duportal** - link:/project/team-leads/#infrastructure[Infrastructure Officer]
* **Wadeck Follonier** - link:/project/team-leads/#security[Security Officer]
* **Kevin Martens** - link:/project/team-leads/#documentation[Documentation Officer]

Thanks to all Jenkins officers for their continued leadership!
Officers take responsibility for many day-to-day processes in the Jenkins community and lead the contributor teams working on them.
It requires significant time commitment and it is not taken for granted.

=== Statistics

This year we had 81 registered voters and around 60 actual votes.
