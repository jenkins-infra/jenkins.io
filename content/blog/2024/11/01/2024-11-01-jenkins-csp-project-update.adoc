Security is a core focus at Jenkins, and through the link:/blog/2024/10/04/content-security-policy-grant/[Content Security Policy (CSP) grant] from the Alpha-Omega Foundation, we're reinforcing our commitment to the stability and safety of our community.
After weeks of progress, collaboration, and technical challenges, it's time to share where we are and what’s next.

== Why CSP Matters
With Jenkins as a crucial tool for thousands worldwide, securing its ecosystem is essential.
link:https://content-security-policy.com/[CSP], a modern web security protocol, helps shield applications from injection attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS).
This project, supported by Alpha-Omega, represents a three-month push to integrate and enhance CSP across Jenkins, thanks to the dedication of developers author:shlomomdahan[Shlomo Dahan] and https://github.com/yaroslavafenkin[Yaroslav Afenkin], and the oversight of author:basil[Basil Crow] and myself.

== Milestones and Achievements

=== Acceptance Testing Success

One of our most significant milestones has been the dramatic improvement in our Acceptance Test Harness (ATH) results.
Starting from a challenging position, we've achieved remarkable progress:

* Initial CSP compatibility testing showed numerous issues.
* Current status: Only 5 remaining failures in restrictive mode.
* Represents a major step toward full CSP implementation.

=== Plugin Modernization Campaign

Our team has systematically worked through the Jenkins plugin ecosystem, modernizing and securing critical components.
Key highlights include:

==== High-Impact Releases

We've successfully updated and released over 20 widely used plugins with improved CSP compatibility, including:

* Core plugins like link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/maven-plugin/[Maven], link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/subversion/[Subversion], and link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/junit/[JUnit].
* Critical workflow components such as the link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/branch-api/[Branch API]and link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-support/[Workflow Support] plugins.
* Popular visualization tools like the link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/echarts-api/[ECharts API] plugin.

==== jQuery Modernization

A special focus has been placed on modernizing jQuery usage across plugins, with notable improvements:

* Upgrading plugins from jQuery 1.x to 3.x.
* Removing inline JavaScript.
* Implementing modern event-handling patterns.

=== Community Impact

This initiative isn't just about code changes — it's about building a more secure foundation for the entire Jenkins community.
Our work has:

* Enhanced security for thousands of Jenkins installations worldwide.
* Provided a clear path forward for plugin maintainers.
* Created examples for future CSP implementations.

=== Looking Forward

As we move into the second phase of this project, we're focusing on:

* Completing the remaining critical plugin updates.
* Finalizing CSP scanner tooling for automated vulnerability detection.
* Creating comprehensive documentation for maintainers and users.
* Preparing for a potential expanded project in 2025.

=== Get Involved

We welcome community participation in this important security initiative.
You can help by:

* Testing your plugins with CSP enabled.
* Reporting any CSP-related issues you encounter.
* Contributing to plugin modernization efforts.
