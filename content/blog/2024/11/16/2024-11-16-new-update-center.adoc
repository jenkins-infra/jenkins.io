== Summary (link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn%27t_read[TL;DR])

Note: this is a follow up of link:/blog/2024/11/07/update-center-brownouts-6/[the 07 and 08 November 2024 24 hours brownout].

The service link:https://updates.jenkins.io[https://updates.jenkins.io] will switch its implementation to the new system, Monday 17 November 2024 at 09:00 am UTC.

All Jenkins users are impacted but should not see any functional change.

⚠️ Please check that your organization respects the advertised DNS TTL or you might be stuck in the brownout longer than expected.

== What is the "Update Center"?

Jenkins link:https://updates.jenkins.io[Update Center] is a web server at the core of the Jenkins public infrastructure that distributes the plugins, tool installers, and versions index to all Jenkins servers across the world.

From the installation wizard to regular plugin updates, if you run Jenkins, then you use this service under the hood.

Today, it serves around 50 Tb of data (outbound bandwidth) each month from a single virtual machine on AWS, which costs around $6,000 per month.

The Jenkins infrastructure team has worked relentlessly over the past years to implement a new sustainable implementation for this service in order to sustain and improve it.

The new Update Center implementation features a highly available system that redirects user requests to a download mirror close to their location.

Additional information is available in the link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2649[GitHub issue].

== What Happens?

After running 6 brownouts (e.g. using the new system in production from 1 to 24 hours),
we are confident we ran out of things to break (©link:https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/basil/[Basil Crow]).

We'll simply switch the DNS entry `updates.jenkins.io` to this new service and continue monitoring it.

In 1 month, if no major issue arise, we'll start decommissioning the old service on the VM which was used for years.
