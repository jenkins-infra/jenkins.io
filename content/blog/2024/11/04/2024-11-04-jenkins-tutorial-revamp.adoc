== Introduction: From IKEA Furniture to LEGO Blocks

On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your experience with tech tutorials in general? If you're like most developers, your answer probably hovers somewhere in the middle. Now, think about your first experience with Jenkins tutorials. Did that number just drop a bit?

Jenkins tutorials used to be like assembling IKEA furniture without instructions. No, it was worse than that—it was like assembling IKEA furniture with proper textual instructions, but only in Swedish, written backward, and you're working in the dark, one hand tied behind your back, with just a hammer. Let's face it: it was frustrating and likely to end in tears.

As engineers, we sometimes forget what it's like to be a beginner. We write tutorials that feel more like riddles wrapped in mysteries inside enigmas. Been there, done that, got the T-shirt, and the headache. But it doesn't have to be this way.

In this blog post, I'll take you through our journey of revamping the Jenkins tutorials, transforming them from complex puzzles into user-friendly guides that feel more like snapping together LEGO blocks. We'll dive deep into the problems we faced, the solutions we implemented, and the impact of our changes.

== The Problem: Old Jenkins Tutorials

=== A Visual Comparison

Before we dive into the specifics, let's take a visual journey through the old and new tutorial experiences:

Did you notice how much scrolling was required on the right side? It was like a never-ending story. And did you see the amount of code users had to copy-paste? While we'll always need a certain amount of code for the Jenkins pipeline itself, the setup process should be as simple as possible. That wasn't the case with the old tutorials.

=== Breaking Down the Issues

Our old tutorials, while comprehensive, presented several significant challenges:

1. *Overwhelming complexity*: Users were bombarded with Docker commands before they could even start learning about Jenkins. The tutorial assumed you were a Docker guru, throwing commands at you like there's no tomorrow.

2. *Assumptions about user knowledge*: The tutorials assumed a high level of Docker expertise. But let me ask you this: how many of you knew Docker really well the first time you tried Jenkins? Exactly. That's not a fair expectation.

3. *Lengthy setup process*: A significant portion of the tutorial was dedicated to setup rather than learning Jenkins itself. We were spending more time with Docker than with Jenkins!

4. *Reliance on outdated tools*: We were heavily dependent on the deprecated BlueOcean plugin, which was no longer recommended.

5. *Docker in Docker*: The old tutorial used Docker in Docker, which is considered a bad practice from a security standpoint.

6. *Lack of context*: The tutorials often lacked explanations for why certain steps were necessary, leaving users to blindly follow instructions without understanding.

Here's a snippet from the old Maven tutorial to illustrate these points:

[source,bash]
----
docker network create jenkins
docker run \
  --name jenkins-docker \
  --rm \
  --detach \
  --privileged \
  --network jenkins \
  --network-alias docker \
  --env DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR=/certs \
  --volume jenkins-docker-certs:/certs/client \
  --volume jenkins-data:/var/jenkins_home \
  --publish 2376:2376 \
  docker:dind \
  --storage-driver overlay2
----

This command, while functional, is overwhelming for beginners and lacks context. Why do we need a Docker network? Why are we running Docker in Docker? These questions were left unanswered.

== The Solution: Revamping with Docker Compose

After much deliberation and feedback, we decided to leverage Docker Compose to simplify the entire setup process. 

=== Why Docker Compose?

Docker Compose can encapsulate complex multi-container setups into a single, easy-to-understand file. It was the only tool that could handle the complexity of the Jenkins controller and agent setup while making it accessible to newcomers.

Here's an example of how Docker Compose simplifies things:

[source,yaml]
----
version: '3.8'
services:
  jenkins:
    image: jenkins/jenkins:lts
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home
  agent:
    image: jenkins/ssh-agent:jdk11
    environment:
      - JENKINS_AGENT_SSH_PUBKEY=<your_public_key>
volumes:
  jenkins_home:
----

With this setup, users can start Jenkins and an agent with a single command: `docker compose up -d`.

=== Key Improvements

1. *Simplified setup*: Instead of a series of complex Docker commands, users can now get started with a single Docker Compose command.

2. *Reduced assumptions*: By encapsulating the setup in Docker Compose, we removed the need for extensive Docker knowledge.

3. *Focus on Jenkins*: With a streamlined setup, users can dive into learning Jenkins faster.

4. *Modernized tools*: We replaced outdated plugins like BlueOcean with more current solutions.

5. *Elimination of Docker in Docker*: Our new setup avoids this security risk entirely.

6. *Contextual guidance*: We've added explanations for each step, helping users understand why they're performing certain actions.

== The Process: Collaboration and Innovation

This revamp was a collaborative effort, with significant contributions from our Google Summer of Code participant, Ashutosh Saxena. His fresh perspective as a newcomer to Jenkins was invaluable in identifying pain points that we, as experienced developers, had overlooked.

=== Key Innovations

1. *Multi-architecture support*: We ensured our Docker images work on both `x86_64` and `ARM64` architectures. This was a significant challenge that Ashutosh tackled using Docker's `buildx` tool.

2. *GitPod integration*: We made Jenkins accessible directly from the browser, reducing hardware barriers to entry. This was particularly important for users with less powerful machines or those in environments with limited resources.

3. *Docker Compose profiles*: We introduced profiles for different languages and technologies, making it easy to switch between setups. For example, users can start a Maven-specific setup with `docker compose --profile maven up -d`.

4. *Automated updates*: We implemented automation to keep our Docker images up-to-date, using tools like Dependabot and UpdateCLI.

== The Result: A More Inclusive Jenkins

The outcome of our efforts is a Jenkins experience that's more inclusive than ever. Let's break down the key improvements:

=== 1. Simplified Setup

Users can now get Jenkins running with a single command. Here's how easy it is:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-tutorials.git`
2. Navigate to the directory: `cd docker-tutorials`
3. Start Jenkins: `docker compose --profile tutorial up -d`

That's it! No more complex Docker commands or manual configuration.

=== 2. Browser-based Access with GitPod

Thanks to GitPod integration, Jenkins is now just a click away, even on less powerful devices. Here's a demonstration:

video::https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gitpod-demo[Jenkins on GitPod Demo]

As you can see, users can start a fully functional Jenkins instance directly in their browser, without any local installation.

=== 3. Flexible Configurations

Docker Compose profiles allow easy switching between different tech stacks. Whether you're working with Maven, Python, or Node.js, you can start the appropriate environment with a simple profile switch.

=== 4. Up-to-date and Secure

By eliminating Docker in Docker and implementing automated updates, we've made the tutorials more secure and easier to maintain.

== The Impact: Before and After

The impact of these changes has been significant and far-reaching:

1. *Increased adoption*: Our Docker images have been downloaded over 22,000 times since launch. We've seen multiple forks of the project, with people using it to create their own Jenkins instances for other technologies.

2. *Educational benefits*: University professors have incorporated these tutorials into their CI/CD curricula. One teacher reported that his students, most of whom had never used Jenkins before, were able to get up and running in minutes. The simplification helped them focus on learning Jenkins rather than fighting with the setup process.

3. *Community engagement*: We've seen regular clones and forks of the repository, indicating active use of our tutorials. Referrals come not just from jenkins.io, but also from Reddit, Medium, and Google searches.

4. *Unexpected benefits*: The new setup has even facilitated testing of major Jenkins upgrades. For example, it's being used to test the ongoing migration to Spring Security 6.x and Spring Framework 6.x. This allows anyone to launch transitional versions of Jenkins with one command and provide valuable feedback on the progress.

== The Future: Call to Action

While we've made significant strides, our work is far from over. We're constantly looking for ways to improve Jenkins, and that's where you come in. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a complete newcomer, your feedback and contributions are invaluable.

We encourage you to:

1. Try out the new tutorials
2. Provide feedback on your experience
3. Contribute ideas or code to further improve the tutorials
4. Share your experience with the community

Remember, Jenkins is a community-driven project. Your input shapes its future!

=== Upcoming Improvements

We're already planning the next phase of improvements:

1. Expanding the range of technology-specific profiles
2. Further refining the GitPod experience
3. Exploring integration with other cloud development environments
4. Continuously updating our documentation to reflect best practices

== Conclusion

We've come a long way from those IKEA furniture days. Now, setting up Jenkins feels more like snapping together LEGO blocks - simple, intuitive, and dare I say, fun? 

By focusing on simplicity and inclusivity, we've not only removed barriers to entry but built bridges to welcome developers of all levels into the Jenkins community. We didn't just remove a barrier; we built a bridge.

So, what are you waiting for? Dive into the new tutorials, and let's build something awesome together!
