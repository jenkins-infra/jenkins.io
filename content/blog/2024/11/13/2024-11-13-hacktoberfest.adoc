The Jenkins community is pleased to have participated in this year’s Hacktoberfest, an event focused on fostering open-source contributions and welcoming new contributors to our ecosystem.

As Hacktoberfest 2024 has come to a close, we're happy to reflect on the community's participation:

== Jenkins’ Contribution to Hacktoberfest

This year, we saw an increase in community engagement, with contributions including *1,174 pull requests* across the `jenkinsci`, `jenkins-infra`, and `jenkins-docs` GitHub organizations.
Notably, *243 pull requests* were part of the Hacktoberfest initiative, contributed by *67 unique participants*.

Out of these submissions, *223 pull requests were successfully merged*, demonstrating the collaborative efforts and commitment of our contributors and maintainers alike, achieving an impressive 92% acceptance rate.

== Encouraging Newcomers

One of our primary objectives during Hacktoberfest is to welcome and support new open-source contributors.
The Jenkins community provided resources and guidance, assisting newcomers in understanding the procedures and standards for quality contributions.

We are proud of all our participants, with special recognition for our seasoned contributors who continue to provide valuable input year after year.
Notable contributions from some of our well-established members include:

- author:jonesbusy[*jonesbusy*], submitting *41 validated pull requests*
- author:basil[*basil*], contributing *14 pull requests*
- author:kmartens27[*kmartens27*], adding *11 pull requests*

Each of these individuals has consistently demonstrated their commitment to enhancing the Jenkins project, contributing their expertise to advance our goals, and mentoring and supporting new contributors along the way.

== Supporting Our Maintainers and Community

The proactive involvement of our project maintainers has been instrumental in the success of Hacktoberfest this year.
Their dedication to preparing repositories by adding relevant topics and tags to ensure clear, accessible contribution guidelines has been crucial.
Our heartfelt thanks go out to all maintainers for fostering a supportive environment for our contributors.

== Looking Forward to Hacktoberfest 2025

With an eye towards next year’s Hacktoberfest, we are keen to build on our success and continue improving our engagement with both long-standing community members and those new to the world of open source.
We hope to keep enriching our processes and support frameworks.

The Jenkins community is proud of what we've achieved together and looks forward to welcoming more individuals into our ongoing open-source projects.
