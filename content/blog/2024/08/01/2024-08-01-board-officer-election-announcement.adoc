== The election consists of 4 phases:

* Nomination of candidates (August 1 - September 15)
* Voter registration (September 16 - October 31)
* Voting (November 1 - November 30)
* Results announcement (December 1)

=== Voting

Participation in the election process requires registering an account on the link:https://community.jenkins.io[Jenkins community forums] and at least one contribution made before September 1, 2024.
When registering, you can use an existing GitHub account or create a new account specifically for link:https://community.jenkins.io[Jenkins community forums].
We ask all community members who are interested in voting and meet the requirements to join the link:https://community.jenkins.io/g/election-voter-2024[election-voter-2024] group during the registration period.
Previous elections utilized their own groups, so joining the link:https://community.jenkins.io/g/election-voter-2024[election-voter-2024] group is required for participation.

We have made the decision to trust participants and not require that you provide evidence of contribution as part of your voter registration.
We reserve the right to ban any account from the election process if we identify abuse.
Once registration is over, a list of email addresses will be sent to the link:https://civs1.civs.us/[Condorcet Internet Voting Service (CIVS)].
