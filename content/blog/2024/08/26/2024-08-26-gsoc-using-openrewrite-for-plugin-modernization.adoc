== About the Project

This project aims to build a generic tool to automate the modernization of Jenkins plugins using link:https://docs.openrewrite.org/[OpenRewrite]. 

This tool allows us to apply link:https://docs.openrewrite.org/recipes[OpenRewrite recipe] transformations across Jenkins plugins, validate the changes, and create pull requests in the respective plugin repositories.

This tool also extracts and stores essential metadata that can be consumed by link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring[Plugin-Health-Scoring] for building more probes. For example, it can identify transitive dependencies and issue warnings if a plugin doesn't use an API plugin as recommended.

== Phase 1

In this phase, we accomplished following tasks:

* Developed a CLI module to parse arguments.
* Created a link:https://docs.openrewrite.org/changelog/earlier-releases/8-1-2-release#what-is-a-scanningrecipe[scanning recipe] to extract metadata.
* Developed a core module using link:https://maven.apache.org/shared/maven-invoker/[Maven invoker] to apply recipes across plugins.

Feel free to watch the demonstration of the tool in the link:https://youtu.be/2OSxGp301C8?si=4GiMezOAHEquzIHo&t=1714[Midterm Presentation].

== Phase 2

In this phase, we accomplished the following tasks:

* Developed a GitHub service for forking, cloning, committing, and creating pull requests.
* Integrated OpenRewrite recipes to the tool.
* Added a caching mechanism.
* Improved the tests and documentation.

== Next Steps

- Integrating more recipes into the tool, allowing us to apply a wide range of changes across the Jenkins ecosystem.
- Storing the extracted metadata in a common location so that it can be used by other projects, such as link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring[Plugin Health Scoring].

== Acknowledgments
