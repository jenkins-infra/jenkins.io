NOTE: This is a speaker blogpost for a DevOps World 2024 talk

We last gave a talk about the Jenkins user experience at DevOps World 2022. Two short years later and we're back again to show what's new and what's coming up in Jenkins.

Expect to hear about the lessons we've learned and the challenges we're tackling as we update Jenkins for the modern web.
