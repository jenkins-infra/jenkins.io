NOTE: This is a speaker blogpost for a link:https://www.devopsworld.com[DevOps World 2024] talk.

We last gave a talk about the Jenkins user experience at DevOps World 2022. Two short years later, we’re back to showcase what’s new and upcoming in the world of Jenkins UX.

We’ll discuss how we’re bringing the best of BlueOcean back to Jenkins, a redesigned builds widget, a new search experience, and more. Expect to hear about the lessons we’ve learned and the challenges we’re tackling as we update Jenkins for the modern web.

We can’t wait to show you what’s next.
