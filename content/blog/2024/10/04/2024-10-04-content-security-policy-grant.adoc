== What is Content Security Policy?

From link:https://content-security-policy.com/[content-security-policy.com]:

> _Content-Security-Policy_ is the name of a HTTP response header that modern browsers use to enhance the security of the document (or web page). The Content-Security-Policy header allows you to restrict which resources (such as JavaScript, CSS, Images, etc.) can be loaded, and the URLs that they can be loaded from.

Using Content-Security-Policy (CSP), injection attacks like cross-site scripting can be prevented.

== Why a grant for Jenkins?

Jenkins is the leading open source automation server.
It provides critical capabilities to organizations around the world as they create, test, and deploy software.
Improving the security of the Jenkins project aligns very well with the Alpha-Omega mission for "sustainable security improvements to the most critical open source software projects".

We hope that the successful completion of this 3-month project will result in additional funding and an expanded project in 2025.
