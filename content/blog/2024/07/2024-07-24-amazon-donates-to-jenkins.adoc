Amazon Web Services has donated $60,000 in cloud credits to the Jenkins project.
We are especially grateful for their donation and their support of Jenkins.

The Jenkins project has used AWS for many years to provide a wide range of services.
AWS provides the central distribution point for Jenkins core and Jenkins plugin downloads through the Jenkins update center.
We've used link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-graviton-performance-testing/what-is-aws-graviton.html[AWS Graviton servers] (Arm architecture) and AWS Intel servers with the Amazon link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/what-is-eks.html[Elastic Kubernetes Service] and as link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html[Elastic Compute Cloud] virtual machines.
AWS has provided consistent, reliable, and scalable services for Jenkins for many years.

We are sincerely grateful for Amazon's most recent contribution to the Jenkins project and thank them for their support of open source software.
