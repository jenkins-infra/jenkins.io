link:https://azure.microsoft.com/[Microsoft Azure] has donated $60,000 in cloud credits to the Jenkins project.
We thank them most sincerely for their donation and for their continuing support of open source software projects like Jenkins.

The Jenkins project uses Microsoft Azure cloud to provide a wide range of services, including all the Jenkins controllers that build Jenkins core, Jenkins components, and over 1000 Jenkins plugins.
Microsoft Azure provides scalable and resilient services for Jenkins continuous integration and continuous delivery processes through link:https://azure.microsoft.com/products/kubernetes-service/[Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)] and link:https://azure.microsoft.com/products/container-instances/[Azure Container Instances (ACI)].

The Jenkins project also uses Microsoft Azure hosted database services including link:https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-cache-for-redis/cache-overview[Azure Cache for Redis], link:https://azure.microsoft.com/products/postgresql[Azure Database for PostgreSQL], and link:https://azure.microsoft.com/products/mysql[Azure Database for MySQL].
We use both Intel based servers and Arm based servers and rely on Microsoft premium file storage and multi-zone storage.

We're sincerely grateful for Microsoft's most recent contribution to the Jenkins project and thank them for their support of open source software.
