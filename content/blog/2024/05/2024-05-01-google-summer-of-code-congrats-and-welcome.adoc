This year, we received numerous outstanding link:https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024/organizations/jenkins-wp[Google Summer of Code] (GSoC) proposals for Jenkins with just as many compelling ideas.
Many thanks to all who submitted their proposal(s) previously.
Due to a very limited number of mentors available, we could only accept a small number of submissions.
Congratulations go out to link:https://github.com/Alaurant[Danyang Zhao], link:https://github.com/sridamul[Sridhar S], link:https://github.com/shlomomdahan[Shlomo Dahan], link:https://github.com/nouralmulhem[Nour Almulhem], and link:https://github.com/TheMeinerLP[Phillipp Glanz] for having been selected for Jenkins in GSoC 2024.
It is now time to roll up our sleeves and get to the heart of why we’re doing this: to help make Jenkins a better project for all users.

In the next few weeks, contributors and project mentors will begin the “Bonding Period” to establish connections with the Jenkins community and to lay out the plans and framework for what is to come in the next 12 weeks.
We are excited to have them on board and can’t wait to see their progress!
