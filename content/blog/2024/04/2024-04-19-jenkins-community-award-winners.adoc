cdCon 2024 just wrapped up in Seattle and this included announcing the winners of the Continuous Delivery Foundation and Jenkins Community Awards.
The CD Foundation provides awards for the Top CDF ambassador, contributor, documenter, and end user.
Anyone that is part of the CD Foundation can be nominated for these.
Additionally, as a graduated project, Jenkins has three of its own awards:

* Most Valuable Jenkins Advocate
* Most Valuable Jenkins Contributor
* Jenkins Security MVP

Thanks to everyone who nominated candidates and voted for the awards, these would not be possible without your participation.
Furthermore, thanks to all the nominees for their work in Jenkins.
The project thrives on the work of the community, and the award winners definitely represent this idea.

The 2024 Jenkins award winners are:

Yaniv reported two critical vulnerabilities towards the end of 2023 that the security team was able to utilize and publish fixes for.
Yaniv's reporting, response, and collaboration was exemplary for the Security team in addressing the issues and ensuring the fixes were complete and thoroughly tested.
Without Yaniv's work, these vulnerabilities could have lingered around longer than we would have liked.
However, thanks to the efforts of both the Jenkins Security team and Yaniv, we were able to address and reassure users of the resolution.
