**Voter registration has started for the 2024 Jenkins Governance Board and Officer elections!**

== Voter registration

Nominations for the 2024 Jenkins Governance Board and Officer elections have finished.
Voter registration opened September 16, 2024 and closes on October 31, 2024.

Participation in the election process requires registering an account on the link:https://community.jenkins.io[Jenkins community forums] and at least one contribution made before September 1, 2024.
When registering, you can use an existing GitHub account or create a new account specifically for link:https://community.jenkins.io[Jenkins community forums].

All community members who meet the requirements and are interested in voting should join the link:https://community.jenkins.io/g/election-voter-2024[election-voter-2024] group during the registration period.
Previous elections utilized their own groups, so joining the link:https://community.jenkins.io/g/election-voter-2024[election-voter-2024] group is required for participation.

Refer to the link:/project/election-walkthrough/#join-the-annual-election-group[voter registration tutorial] for detailed registration steps.

We have made the decision to trust participants and not require that you provide evidence of contribution as part of your voter registration.
We reserve the right to ban any account from the election process if we identify abuse.
Once registration is over, a list of email addresses will be sent to the link:https://civs1.civs.us/[Condorcet Internet Voting Service (CIVS)].
