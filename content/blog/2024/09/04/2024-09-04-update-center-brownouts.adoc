overview: "We'll be using the new Update Center implementation in production for 1 hour, twice!"

== Summary (link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn%27t_read[TL;DR])

The service https://updates.jenkins.io will switch its implementation to a new system during 1 hour twice:

- Friday 6 September 2024 from 07:00am UTC until 09:00am UTC
- Monday 9 September 2024 from 02:00pm UTC until 03:00pm UTC


All Jenkins users are impacted but should not see any functional change.

⚠️ Please, check that your organization respects the advertised DNS TTL or you might be stuck in the brownout longer that expected.

Under the hood, any HTTP request made to this service will be redirected to a mirror close to user locations during these brownouts.

== What is the "Update Center"?

Jenkins https://updates.jenkins.io[Update Center] is a web server at the core of the Jenkins public infrastructure which distributes the plugins, tool installers and versions index to all Jenkins servers all across the world.

From the Wizard installation to regular plugin updates, if you run Jenkins then you use this service under the hood.

Today, it serves around 50 Tb of data (outbound bandwidth) each month from a single Virtual Machine on AWS which costs around $6,000 per month.

In order to sustain this service and improve it, the Jenkins infrastructure has relentlessly worked during the past years to have a new sustainable implementation for this service.

The new Update Center implementation features an highly available system which redirects user requests to a download mirror close to their location.
You can read the details on the (long) following issue GitHub: https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2649.

== Why this "link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownout_(electricity)[Brownout]"?

We have reached the point where our functional/performance tests are meeting our expectation:

- All of our Jenkins controllers are using the new Update Center implementation
- We are using the new updates center (with DNS override) in our own networks in different geo-locations
- All of our Jenkins Docker image are using the new system
- Our initial performance tests

But as the adage says: "No plan survives first contact".

That's why we are planning these brownouts of one hour each to:

- Validate our system above the tests we already ran to increase trust
- Run a real life (production!) workload against the new system while limiting any unforeseen impact due to the short time window

== How

Both current and new Update Center are updated at the same time and serves the same index.

Since 4 weeks, the Jenkins infra uses the new Update Center (https://azure.updates.jenkins.io ) with a client-side DNS override (`updates.jenkins.io` hostname points to this new service).

During the brownouts, we'll simply switch the DNS entry `updates.jenkins.io` to this new service and watch for the logs and error rate.
At the end of each brownout, we'll switch DNS back to the normal service and then analyse metrics and logs to see how the system behaved.

- If no major problem is detected then we'll plan a 24 hours brownout soon.
- Otherwise we'll analyse the discovered problem and plan solutions.
