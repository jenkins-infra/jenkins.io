== Summary (link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn%27t_read[TL;DR])

Note: this is a follow up of link:/blog/2024/09/04/update-center-brownouts/[the 6 and 9 September brownouts].

The service https://updates.jenkins.io will switch its implementation to a new system during 1 day:

- Wednesday 11 September 2024 from 02:00pm UTC until Thursday 12 September 2024 02:00pm UTC

All Jenkins users are impacted but should not see any functional change.

⚠️ Please, check that your organization respects the advertised DNS TTL or you might be stuck in the brownout longer than expected.

Under the hood, any HTTP request made to this service will be redirected to a mirror close to user locations during these brownouts.

== What is the "Update Center"?

Jenkins link:https://updates.jenkins.io[Update Center] is a web server at the core of the Jenkins public infrastructure which distributes the plugins, tool installers, and versions index to all Jenkins servers across the world.

From the installation wizard to regular plugin updates, if you run Jenkins, then you use this service under the hood.

Today, it serves around 50 Tb of data (outbound bandwidth) each month from a single virtual machine on AWS, which costs around $6,000 per month.

In order to sustain this service and improve it, the Jenkins infrastructure team has worked relentlessly during the past years to have a new sustainable implementation for this service.

The new Update Center implementation features a highly available system that redirects user requests to a download mirror close to their location.
Additional information is available in the link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/2649[GitHub issue].

== Why this "link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownout_(electricity)[Brownout]"?

Our functional tests and performance tests are meeting our expectations:

- All of our Jenkins controllers are using the new Update Center implementation.
- We are using the new update center (with DNS override) in our own networks in different geo-locations.
- All of our Jenkins Docker images are using the new system.
- Our initial performance tests
- After link:/blog/2024/09/04/update-center-brownouts/[2 successful 1-hour brownouts]

== How

Both current and new Update Centers are updated at the same time and serve the same index.

Starting 5 weeks ago, the Jenkins infrastructure has been using the new Update Center (link:https://azure.updates.jenkins.io) with a client-side DNS override (`updates.jenkins.io` hostname points to this new service).

During this brownout, we'll simply switch the DNS entry `updates.jenkins.io` to this new service and watch for the logs and error rate.
At the end, we'll switch DNS back to the normal service and then analyze metrics and logs to see how the system behaved.

We are confident the new system will perform as expected. We now want to execute a 1-day brownout.
