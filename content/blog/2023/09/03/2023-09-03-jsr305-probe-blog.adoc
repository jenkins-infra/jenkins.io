== Introduction

The `JSR-305` framework provides annotations to detect software defects. Its executive committee voted it as dormant since May 2012 (see: link:https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=305[JSR 305: Annotations for Software Defect Detection
])

It is important to stop using the framework for the following reasons:

- It is not maintained anymore.
- The annotations have questionable license.
- The annotations are in the reserved javax namespace and there is no public release of the spec (Nor is there ever likely to be. See point 1).

`@Nonnull` and `@CheckForNull` annotations (part of JSR-305) have been link:https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/tutorial-improve/replace-jsr-305-annotations/[deprecated since 2016].

The `JSR-305` probe checks whether the deprecated annotations are used in a plugin.

== Importance of the probe

This probe will identify the outdated annotations used in the plugin and highlight them in the scoring system.

== Challenges and Learning

The outdated annotations are imported in `.java` files. My first approach was to go for an abstract class because I assumed there could be other probes that may require to look for code in `.java` files.
After a series of reviews, one of the mentors pointed out that to comply with the link:https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-jenkins/blob/98bfbecc9c9507a069c9ac1f1e35cd5dd0fa0687/src/main/resources/META-INF/rewrite/rewrite.yml[OpenWrite rule] all imports from the `javax.annotation` package should be checked for deprecation.

Also, based on the link:https://blog.devgenius.io/key-principles-in-software-dry-kiss-yagni-solid-and-other-acronyms-98e5575a6942[YAGNI principle] ("You Aren't Gonna Need It") which means develop features only when you need it, the `abstract` wasn't the current requirement. I restructured the code and used a single class to implement the probe.

== Conclusion and Outcome
This probe will identify the deprecated annotations and let the maintainers know which imports in a plugin require replacement.
