== Introduction

The `JSR-305` framework provides annotations to detect software defects. Its executive committee voted it as dormant since May 2012 (see: link:https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=305[JSR 305: Annotations for Software Defect Detection
])

It is important to stop using the framework for the following reasons:

- It is not maintained anymore.
- The annotations have questionable license.
- The annotations are in the reserved javax namespace and there is no public release of the spec (Nor is there ever likely to be. See point 1).

`@Nonnull` and `@CheckForNull` annotations (part of JSR-305) have been link:https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/tutorial-improve/replace-jsr-305-annotations/[deprecated since 2016].

The `JSR-305` probe checks whether the deprecated annotations are used in a plugin.

== Importance of the probe

This probe will identify the outdated annotations used in the plugin and highlight them in the scoring system.

== Challenges and Learning

The outdated annotations are imported in `.java` files. Created an abstract class that would read the desired imports in the `.java` files of a plugin.

The `JSR-305` probe extends this abstract class and searches for the imports.

== Conclusion and Outcome
This probe will identify the deprecated annotations and let the maintainers know which imports in a plugin require replacement.
