== Introduction

`@Nonnull` and `@CheckForNull` annotations (part of JSR-305) have been link:https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/tutorial-improve/replace-jsr-305-annotations/[deprecated since 2016]. For security reasons it is important that the outdated annotations are highlighted and replaced with `javax.annotation.Nonnull` and `edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.NonNull`

The `JSR-305` probe checks whether the deprecated annotations are imported and used in a plugin.

== Importance of the probe

This probe will identify the outdated annotations used in the plugin and highlight them in the scoring system.

== Challenges and Learning

The outdated annotations are imported in `.java` files. Created an abstract class that would read the desired imports in the `.java` files of a plugin.

The `JSR-305` probe extends this abstract class and searches for the imports.

== Conclusion and Outcome
This probe will identify the deprecated annotations and let the maintainers know where the fix is required.
