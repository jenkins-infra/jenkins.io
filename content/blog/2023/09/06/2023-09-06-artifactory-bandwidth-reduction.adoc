link:https://jfrog.com/[JFrog] has been a sponsor of the Jenkins project for many years.
We're delighted that they continue to sponsor the Jenkins project and continue to provide our artifact hosting service, link:https://repo.jenkins-ci.org[repo.jenkins-ci.org].

Releases, incremental development builds, and snapshots of Jenkins core, Jenkins tooling, Jenkins plugins, and Jenkins infrastructure components are hosted on JFrog Artifactory.
The worldwide Jenkins community has been well served for many years by JFrog's hosted artifact repository.

// == Bandwidth misuse

// We've had instances in the past when we detected excessive or unhelpful use of the Jenkins artifact repository.
// During peak usage, over 50 TB of data was transferred each month.

// JFrog asked us to find ways to reduce that usage.
// We've found a low impact way to reduce misuse of the artifact repository bandwidth while continuing to meet the needs of the Jenkins project.

== Maven Central

Effective Thursday September 7, 2023, we'll stop caching the Apache Maven Central repository.
The change will be transparent to Jenkins developers because Apache Maven automatically appends the Apache Maven Central repository to its list of repositories.
Beginning Thursday September 7, 2023, Jenkins developers will receive Maven Central artifacts from Maven Central instead of receiving them from the Jenkins Artifactory.
