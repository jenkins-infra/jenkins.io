== Introduction

`Incremental Build Detection Probe`  was developed as a part of link:/projects/gsoc/2023/projects/add-probes-to-plugin-health-score/[Google summer of Code 2023] for the plugin health scoring system project.

Incremental Builds aids in continuous delivery of the plugin. It deploys only the modules affected by new commits footnote:[https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/maven]. Jenkins core and plugin can be deployed incrementally rather than waiting for the developer to manually deploy the release footnote:[https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/305/README.adoc].

This probe identifies the plugins that have configured `incremental-builds`.

== Importance of the Probe
This probe encourages automation in delivery and saves maintainer from manual deployment.


== Challenges
Understanding the configuration and implementation posed a major challenge in this probe.
To me, it seemed that I need to check the configuration for link:https://maven.apache.org/maven-ci-friendly.html[Maven Friendly CI versions].

My mentor pointed out the following and explained that link:https://matrix.to/#/!VkECGUHmVHbfLeicii:gitter.im/$_CwOuPxb9DPkkWTaO4QFIXOMmEqPeHpOq4Ca2eTrw-4?via=gitter.im&via=matrix.org&via=matrix.freyachat.eu[the actual configuration goes deeper]:

- The link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/305/README.adoc#setup[setup is actually done in `.mvn/maven.config`] it is essential that I look for the configuration in  `.mvn/maven.config`.
- Some plugins configure it in `extensions.xml` in the `.mvn` like the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin/blob/0141a5f145128b5b8458d40686a3904006f45b8d/.mvn/extensions.xml[kubernetes-plugin].
- The final step was to look for the configuration in the CD workflow. As the `jep-229` (Continuous Delivery Probe) is already live, I need not look for this configuration.

== Outcome and Learning

Learned more about GitHub Workflows and its strength. This probe is merged and ready to be live.
