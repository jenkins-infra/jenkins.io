Microsoft has donated $40,000 USD to the Continuous Delivery Foundation for use in member projects.
The Jenkins project is pleased to be using those credits to reduce CDF expenses.

The AWS cost reduction project has a working prototype that is using Cloudflare R2 and the Jenkins mirror system to reduce bandwidth costs.
We plan to complete the Jenkins Enhancement Proposal, a prototype temporary transition, and the production transition by January 31, 2024.

Contributed by: author:markewaite[Mark Waite]

Jenkins 2.426.1 provides a new “Appearance” page so that administrators have a single page to configure the Jenkins theme and other user interface details.
Thanks to author:timja[Tim Jacomb] for the Appearance page.

Jenkins 2.426.1 also updates the Jenkins user experience with confirmation dialogs inside the pages instead of using the web browser’s confirmation dialog.
Thanks to link:https://github.com/mawinter69[Markus Winter] for the implementation of those dialogs and for the API that allows plugins to do the same.

Keyboard navigation has been improved in Jenkins 2.426.1 as well.
Users can now access tab panes by keyboard navigation.

* Java 21 support
** The https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/cd176912ed8797ddee1066be59b1a68fb9b6bc77/jep/0000/README.adoc[Jenkins enhancement proposal] by Mark Waite is progressing nicely.
** Progress of testing the top plugins with Java 21:
*** 108 of the top plugin repositories passing tests with Java 21.
*** 20 of the top plugin repositories not yet passing tests with Java 21.
** The Infrastructure team finished the transition to official 21.0.1+12 Linux (17 on Windows).
** All agents and controllers now supply a JDK21 or JDK21 preview Docker image.
* Java 17 is now the default Java version used in the Docker images, even for the LTS and Windows:
** If you don’t use a tag specifying the JDK version like https://hub.docker.com/layers/jenkins/jenkins/2.429-jdk11/images/sha256-4a0743c391adeaf80716c14a1d2573f150328181c60b83f23eb1504e59f228bb?context=explore[2.429-jdk11], but shorter tags like https://hub.docker.com/layers/jenkins/jenkins/2.429/images/sha256-9036a884d9a8055a99d4e475080150a6d24b611018ccbc73080d492ccf9930d2?context=explore[2.429], you will end up with an image using JDK17 and not JDK11 anymore.
* OS support:
** CentOS 7 container images have been https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker/pull/1777[removed], starting from the 2.432 release.
* ARM64:
** More services in the infrastructure have migrated to a new ARM64 nodepool.

The link:http://contributors.jenkins.io[Contributor Spotlight] is a new location where we will be highlighting the top contributors to Jenkins.
We have been gathering and measuring data to determine who would be part of this group, and then reached out to everyone to collaborate and capture their stories.
Thanks to all of the contributors who have collaborated with us on this project thus far, and all those who we will be working with going forward as well.
We’ll be publishing new Contributor Spotlights every two weeks, to provide space for the current spotlight to shine and leave room for other announcements or news.
Thanks to author:alyssat[Alyssa Tong], author:gounthar[Bruno Verachten], author:jmmeessen[Jean-Marc-Meessen], author:krisstern[Kris Stern], author:hlemeur[Hervé Le Meur] and Cristina Pizzagalli for their work in gathering the data, designing the site, getting the site into production, and offering guidance along every step of the way.

November had four blog posts, including the link:/blog/2023/11/10/Jenkins-Contributor-Summit-in-Brussels/[Jenkins Contributor summit at FOSDEM] announcement, the link:/blog/2023/11/06/introducing-2-2-2-java-support-plan/[2+2+2 Jenkins Java support plan], and the announcement of the Contributor Spotlight site.
