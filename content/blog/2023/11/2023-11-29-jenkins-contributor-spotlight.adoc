The Jenkins project has evolved constantly over the years, thanks to the tireless efforts of the Jenkins community.
There are numerous contributors that work behind the scenes to ensure that Jenkins is functioning and staying on the cutting edge, in addition to being voices within the community and advocating for Jenkins.
It is with this sentiment in mind that we want to acknowledge and share our appreciation for these contributors.
Therefore, we are excited to announce and introduce the link:https://contributors.jenkins.io/[Jenkins Contributor Spotlight] page, with our first contributor spotlight for author:notmyfault[Alexander Brandes]!

This is the result of several months of research, collaboration, and determining who some of the heaviest Jenkins contributors are.
Thanks to author:alyssat[Alyssa Tong], author:jmmeessen[Jean-Marc Meessen], and author:gounthar[Bruno Verachten] for organizing the project, retrieving the data that was used, and guiding the project direction.
We also want to share thanks to Cristina Pizzagalli for helping us design the site and author:krisstern[Kris Stern] for all of their work creating the site and working with the Infrastructure team to get the site integrated.
To get started, we reached out to the top ~30 contributors to better understand their backgrounds and gather some insight into their Jenkins experiences.
Thankfully, everyone that has responded has shared not only their Jenkins background and experience, but also some of their personal background.
This is a wonderful representation of the global reach that the Jenkins community has, and we want to ensure that there is a human element in addition to the technical parts.
Going forward, a new contributor spotlight will be published every two weeks.
This will provide ample time for the current contributor to shine and provide space for other announcements or news to be shared.

Ultimately, Jenkins would not be where it is without the efforts of the greater community.
We want to share our deepest thanks and appreciation to all Jenkins contributors, and highlight some of the heaviest lifters.
