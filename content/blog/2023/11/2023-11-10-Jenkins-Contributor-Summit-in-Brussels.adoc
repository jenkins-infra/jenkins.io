== What is a Jenkins Contributor Summit?

The Jenkins Contributor Summit brings together current and future contributors to the Jenkins project. 
At this event, we will talk about the current state of the project and its future evolution. 
It is a great opportunity to meet fellow members of the Jenkins community "in real life".

It is a day-long event (from 10h00 to 17h00) featuring presentations on the "State of Jenkins", Project/SIG updates, discussion on various key projects, "Ignite Talks", and demos.

Don't hesitate to reach out if you want to submit a presentation, talk, or demo!
Refer to the *Contact* section to find out how to get in touch.
