We are happy to announce that we will hold a **Jenkins Contributor Summit** in Brussels prior to FOSDEM. 

link:https://fosdem.org/2024/[FOSDEM] is a free event for software developers to meet, share ideas and collaborate. 
Every year, thousands of developers of free and open source software from all over the world gather at the event in Brussels. 
It takes place on Saturday 3 & Sunday 4 February 2024.

== What is a Jenkins Contributor Summit?**
The Jenkins Contributor Summit brings together current and future contributors to the Jenkins project. 
At this event  we will talk about the current state of the project and its future evolution. 
It is a great opportunity to meet "in real life" fellow actors of the Jenkins community.

It is a day's event (10h00 to 17h00) with presentations on the "State of Jenkins", Project/SIG updates, and various key projects as well as "Ignite Talks" or demos.

Don't hesitate to reach out (see contact section) if you want to submit a presentation, a talk, or a demo.
