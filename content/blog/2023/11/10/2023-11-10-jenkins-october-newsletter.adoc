The link:/blog/2023/11/06/introducing-2-2-2-java-support-plan/[2 + 2 + 2 Java support plan] has been announced as the Jenkins project approach to support Java versions now and in the future.
We plan to generally support two Java LTS releases at any one time, with a transition period over the next 2 years.

Java 21 support by the Jenkins project is looking very, very good.
Jenkins 2.426.1 is scheduled to be released Nov 15, 2023 with full support for Java 21.
Read more about the Java support plan in the link:/blog/2023/11/06/introducing-2-2-2-java-support-plan/[recent blog post] from author:basil[Basil Crow].
Thanks to author:basil[Basil Crow], author:gounthar[Bruno Verachten], author:notmyfault[Alexander Brandes], author:markewaite[Mark Waite], and many others for their efforts to bring Java 21 support to Jenkins users.

Jenkins 2.426.1 will also be the first LTS release that removes Prototype.js.
Jenkins 2.426 weekly link:/blog/2023/10/09/prototype-removed/[removed Prototype.js] after 6 months of work across over 50 plugins.
Sincere thanks to author:timja[Tim Jacomb], author:basil[Basil Crow], and link:/blog/2023/10/09/prototype-removed/[many others] for finishing the project that was first announced in link:/blog/2023/05/12/removing-prototype-from-jenkins/[May 2023].

* Latest Java releases - progress with installation and Jenkins development
** Oct 18, https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2023.html#AppendixJAVA[2023 Oracle patch day]
*** Java 11.0.21
*** Java 17.0.9
*** Java 21.0.1
* Java 21 support
** link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/cd176912ed8797ddee1066be59b1a68fb9b6bc77/jep/0000/README.adoc[Jenkins enhancement proposal] by Mark Waite is progressing nicely
** Progress testing the top plugins with Java 21
*** 36 are now tested with Java 21 (Jenkinsfile modified)
*** 90 are known to work with Java 21
*** 13 don’t work yet with Java 21 (too outdated, using gradle, not in jenkinsci organization)
** In infra, finished the transition to official JDK 21.0+35.
** All agents and controllers now supply a JDK21 or JDK21 preview Docker image.
* Java 17 is now the default Java version used in the Docker images, even for the LTS:
** If you don’t use a tag specifying the JDK version like link:https://hub.docker.com/layers/jenkins/jenkins/2.429-jdk11/images/sha256-4a0743c391adeaf80716c14a1d2573f150328181c60b83f23eb1504e59f228bb?context=explore[2.429-jdk11] but shorter tags like link:https://hub.docker.com/layers/jenkins/jenkins/2.429/images/sha256-9036a884d9a8055a99d4e475080150a6d24b611018ccbc73080d492ccf9930d2?context=explore[2.429], you will end up with an image using JDK17 and not JDK11 anymore.


[[documentation]]

Contributed by: author:kmartens27[Kevin Martens]

There were only three blog posts during October, including the September newsletter.
However, the two non-newsletter posts provide great information.
The Plugin Health Scoring blog post, from Adrien Lecharpentier, announces and shares insight into the plugin health scoring system, and what that score means for a plugin.
The link:/blog/2023/10/31/marc-s-napkin-upgrade-guide/[guide to update Jenkins], from new author author:mwp565733[Marc Phillips], provides instructions on how to update Jenkins and what his process looks like.

Additionally, we received several documentation updates from new Jenkins contributors.
While these may not have been huge changes, the effort and work done by new community members is always appreciated.
Thanks to everyone who contributed during October and Hacktoberfest!
