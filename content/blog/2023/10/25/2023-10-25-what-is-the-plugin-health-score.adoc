== Short story long

Since October 24th, there is an additional tab named *Health Score* on each plugin page in link:https://plugins.jenkins.io[plugins.jenkins.io]. 

This new tab provide the plugin's score with every part which contributed to that score.
The score is meant to be unbiased and all the plugins are evaluated the same way.

Here is what it looks like:

== Back to the beginning

Started with GSoC 2022 and continued with GSoC 2023, we created the Plugin Health Scoring project within and for the Jenkins community.

The purpose of the project is to provide an unbiased score to all plugin.
The score is based on data gathered on the plugin and those data are analyzed the same way for each and every plugin.

== Understanding the scores

The scores are baesd on data gathered from each plugins.
We use the `update-center.json` to have the list of plugins and their source code location.

Based on that, we ran, what we can `probes` on each plugin.
The purpose of those probes is strictly about gathering data: 

* is there a `Jenkinsfile` within the plugin repository?
* when was the last commit on the default branch of the repository?
* etc.

link:https://plugin-health.jenkins.io/probes[Here is the list of probes] in the project, and you can find their source code link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/tree/main/core/src/main/java/io/jenkins/pluginhealth/scoring/probes[here].

Once the data is gathered, we ran a list of `scoring` processes, which grade all plugins only based on the data.
All plugins are scores using the same criteria.
You can find the list of `scoring` processes link:https://plugin-health.jenkins.io/scores[here] and their implementation link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/tree/main/core/src/main/java/io/jenkins/pluginhealth/scoring/scores[here]

You can find more about the architecture and behavior of the Plugin Health Scoring project on its link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/blob/main/docs/ARCHITECTURE.adoc[documentation].

== How is it displayed?

The score of every plugins is fetch when the plugin-site is built.
That data is used to build the `/<plugin-name>/healthscore/` page, using the component `PluginHealthScore`.
That component can be found link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-site/blob/master/plugins/plugin-site/src/components/PluginHealthScore.jsx[here].

The score and the different categories are dynamic, so there are directly coming from the Plugin Health Scoring project.

== Disclamer

The scores are not perfect and are just another indicators of the plugin state.
We are still working on using more data from the plugin to contribute to the score.

The grading system which generate the score for each plugin is, I believe, subjective. 
However, it is not written in marble and can / will evolve in the future.

If there is something incorrect about a plugin, a false negative please raise a issue on the link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-health-scoring/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug-report.yaml[Plugin Health Scoring project].
