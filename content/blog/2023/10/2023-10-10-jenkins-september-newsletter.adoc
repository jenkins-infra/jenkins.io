* The bandwidth reduction on Artifactory is complete: repo.jenkins-cio.org no longer mirrors Apache Maven repositories, thanks to our infrastructure caching. We've seen more than a 50% decrease in monthly outbound downloads.
* We've been doing some plumbing work to increase the availability of jenkins.io web services during operations (or those pesky unplanned infrastructure problems). No more outages when upgrading Kubernetes for replicated services. That's right, we've got your back.
* We have a new sponsor for the Jenkins Project: Cloudflare. We're currently evaluating migrating updates.jenkins.io to their system next month. Exciting times ahead!
* ARM64: We've migrated 5 new services (making a total of 7) from x86 to ARM64, including jenkins.io and javadoc.jenkins.io. We're moving on up!
* It's time to say goodbye to Oracle Cloud! The sponsorship has ended, and archives.jenkins.io now runs on DigitalOcean. We're grateful to both of these providers for their past and present help. Here's to new beginnings!
