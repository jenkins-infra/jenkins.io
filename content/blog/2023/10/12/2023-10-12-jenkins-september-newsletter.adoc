Voter registration is now open for the 2023 Jenkins elections.
We're electing two board members and all five officers.
Jenkins contributors must register to vote in **each year's elections**.

=== How do I register to vote?

More detailed instructions are available in the link:/blog/2023/09/18/board-officer-election-announcement/[Jenkins elections 2023 blog post].

=== New Jenkins features

The 10 year old JavaScript library, `Prototype.js`, has been removed from Jenkins 2.426 as announced in a link:/blog/2023/10/09/prototype-removed/[recent blog post] by Basil Crow.
The Jenkins board extends its sincere thanks to Tim Jacomb, Basil Crow, Rahul Somasunderam, and many others that worked to remove that old library from Jenkins core and over 60 plugins.

* The bandwidth reduction on Artifactory is complete as `repo.jenkins-cio.org` no longer mirrors Apache Maven repositories, thanks to our infrastructure caching.
We've seen a decrease of more than 50% in monthly outbound downloads.
* We've been doing some plumbing work to increase the availability of jenkins.io web services during operations (or those pesky unplanned infrastructure problems).
No more outages when upgrading Kubernetes for replicated services.
That's right, we've got your back!
* We have a new sponsor for the Jenkins Project in Cloudflare.
We're currently evaluating migrating `updates.jenkins.io` to their system next month.
Exciting times ahead!
* ARM64: We've migrated 5 new services, making for a total of 7, from x86 to ARM64, including jenkins.io and javadoc.jenkins.io.
We're moving on up!
* It's time to say goodbye to Oracle Cloud!
The sponsorship has ended and `archives.jenkins.io` now runs on DigitalOcean.
We're grateful to both of these providers for their past and present help.
Here's to new beginnings!
