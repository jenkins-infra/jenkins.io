Following up on my previous post about link:/blog/2023/05/12/removing-prototype-from-jenkins/[removing Prototype from Jenkins],
Prototype has been removed from the 2.426 weekly release and will be removed from the November LTS release.
This removal required changes in about 60 plugins.
**Use the Plugin Manager to upgrade all plugins before and after upgrading to Jenkins 2.426.**

A migration of this scope would not have been possible without the support of the entire Jenkins community.
In particular, we would like to thank Tim Jacomb and Rahul Somasunderam for doing a large portion of the development work.
Additionally, we would like to thank the following contributors for participating in the removal of Prototype from the Jenkins project
by developing, reviewing, or releasing a Prototype-related change in the `jenkinsci` and/or `jenkins-infra` GitHub organizations:
