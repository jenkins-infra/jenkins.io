* A link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker/blob/master/SECURITY.md[Security Policy] was added for the Docker images of the project.
** Due to multiple reports about CVEs present in the Docker images the project was publishing, we wanted to clarify the situation.
** Most CVEs do not impact the final application and do not require publishing justifications about the lack of impact on numerous CVEs every week.
* One link:/security/advisory/2023-05-16/[plugin advisory] was published on May 16:
** This included at least one high vulnerability in a very popular plugin.


[[Governance]]

Contributed by: author:markewaite[Mark Waite]

Several significant initiatives are already in progress within the Jenkins project.

Thanks to those who are leading the initiatives and thanks to those who are assisting with initiatives like:

* Prototype.js removal from Jenkins core and Jenkins plugins.
Contributing guidelines are in the link:/blog/2023/05/12/removing-prototype-from-jenkins/[blog post].
Detailed issue reports are available in the jira:JENKINS-70906[Jira epic].
Progress reports for affected plugins are available in the link:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dpaKALZaK0_HIGy6ony3wnegr1frTg3u1lngG4KdoC8/edit?usp=sharing[tracking sheet].
* HTMLUnit 3 upgrade in the Jenkins test harness, Jenkins core, and many Jenkins plugins.
* Guava 32 upgrade

We're also excited to have additional efforts in:

* Reducing the core pull request evaluation time (and cost) with Launchable.
* Using GitHub autolink for easier references to Jenkins Jira tickets.

[[infrastructure]]

* The Cloud Cost Controls effort has continued by optimizing resource usage, resulting in:
** Decreased the AWS bill of $ 3,000 (14,000 -> 11,000).
** Decreased the Azure bill of $ 2,000 to (11,000 -> 9,000) despite adding resources.
* Launchable is now generally available for community developers on ci.jenkins.io.
* Jenkins LTS `2.387.3` was deployed everywhere less than 24 hours after it was released.
* Ubuntu `22.04` upgrade campaign (`18.04` is end of life) continued (6 more VMs, 5 VMs left).
* Build workload migration to `ARM64`: internal tools.

Contributed by: author:markewaite[Mark Waite]

The user experience SIG continues to improve the look and feel and the accessibility of the Jenkins user interface.

The link:/blog/2023/05/12/removing-prototype-from-jenkins/[Prototype.js removal from Jenkins core and Jenkins plugins] has already shown us that additional UI capabilities will be available as we remove that old library.
Dr. Ullrich Hafner has created a link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/data-tables-api-plugin/pull/356[prototype] of one of those enhancements in the data tables plugin.

Cristina Pizzagalli and Jan Faracik have both been working on improving accessibility for Jenkins users with disabilities.
We particularly thank the usability and accessibility team at Deutsche Telekom IT GmbH for their jira:JENKINS-71153[accessibility assessment report].

* Deprecation
** Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (and derivatives) early end of life
*** To ensure a smooth transition, we are implementing several measures to inform users when an operating system is approaching its end of life.
These changes will be visible in upcoming releases and container images.
*** Key Dates:
**** May 28 - https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/7913[Pull request] merged
**** May 30 - link:/blog/2023/05/30/operating-system-end-of-life/[Blog post] and https://community.jenkins.io/t/end-of-life-operating-systems/7644[community topic]
**** May 30 - First weekly release containing the warning - `2.407`
**** Nov 16 - RHEL 7 support ends in Jenkins
* Ongoing work
** author:dduportal[Damien Duportal] is actively working on code factorization, specifically targeting a single repository for all agent images.
*** This will streamline maintenance tasks, such as fixing CVEs.
*** The first phase for JDK versions has already been completed, resulting in significantly reduced code size.
*** Additionally, efforts are underway to merge two agents, aiming for synchronized release cycles.
This change should not impact end users, except for the transition of the repository into an archive.
** We can provide more frequent updates on the development of Alpine images thanks to the use of `updatecli`.
** There is an ongoing discussion in the https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker/pull/1629[pull request] regarding the switch of the Alma Linux container from version 8 to version 9.
* What has been done
** Updates on Docker Images:
*** Significant progress has been made on ppc64le.
Thank you, link:https://github.com/ksalerno99[Kenneth], for your valuable contributions!
*** PRs for https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-agent/pull/391[docker-agent], https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-ssh-agent/pull/220[docker-ssh-agent], https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-inbound-agent/pull/339[inbound-agent], and the https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker/pull/1586[controller] have been successfully merged.
*** Ssh-agent release link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-ssh-agent/releases/tag/5.0.0[5.0.0] introduces breaking changes.
**** JDK8 support has been dropped in favor of JDK11 as the default for running Jenkins agents.
