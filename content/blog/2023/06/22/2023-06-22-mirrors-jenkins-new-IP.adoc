The Jenkins project packages and plugins are hosted through a network of mirror servers (provided by our sponsors) close to your location.

It provides a "HTTP redirector" service hosted behind the `get.jenkins.io`, `mirrors.jenkins.io` and `mirrors.jenkins-ci.org` domains, with a new public IP: +++<s>`20.119.232.75`</s>+++ `20.7.178.24` (as per link:/blog/2023/07/12/jenkins-mirrors-postmortem-outage/[]) since the 12th of June 2023.
The former redirector service and its previous IPv4 will be decommissioned the 27th of June 2023.

IMPORTANT: Please update your DNS servers and firewall rules to the new IP +++<s>`20.119.232.75`</s>+++ `20.7.178.24` if you are in a restricted environment.
