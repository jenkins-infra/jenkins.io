The Jenkins project provides a download mirror infrastructure allowing to download Jenkins packages and plugins from a download server close to your location.

It provides a "HTTP redirector" service hosted behind the domains `get.jenkins.io`, `mirrors.jenkins.io` and `mirrors.jenkins-ci.org` which has a new public IP since the 12 June 2023.

Please update your DNS servers and firewall rules to the new IP `20.119.232.75` if you have a restricted environment.

The former redirector service and its previous IPv4 will be decommissioned the 27 of June 2023.
