Should you ever need to rebuild a Jenkins MSI on your Windows machine, here is a way to do it.

== Pre-requisites

=== Jenkins WAR file

First, you should download the Jenkins war file that will be inside the MSI file.
You can access it from the official Jenkins website or from https://updates.jenkins.io/[the Jenkins update center].

Check the link:/download/[Jenkins download page] to download the latest weekly version of Jenkins for example.
You can always access https://updates.jenkins.io/latest/jenkins.war[the direct link] to get the latest weekly version, but you won't necessarily know which version number you are using.
Just saying.

=== Git

There are quite a few ways to install Git on Windows, but the most straightforward way is to see what the https://git-scm.com/download/win[official Git website recommends].

=== Install MSBuild

You can install https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe[MSBuild] from Visual Studio or from the https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022[Build Tools for Visual Studio].

This command line tool is used to build the MSI file.

=== Install .NET Framework 3.5

You may already have it installed on your machine, but not activated.
You can activate it from the Windows Features dialog box.

To access this dialog box, press the keys +++<kbd>+++⊞ Win+++</kbd>+++ + +++<kbd>+++R+++</kbd>+++, then enter the command `appwiz.cpl` and push enter.
Search for

____
Turn Windows features on or off.
____

Tick the `.NET Framework 3.5` entry and install.

IMPORTANT: now run Windows Update to check for security updates.

If it is not installed yet, you can install https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net35-sp1[.NET Framework 3.5] from the Windows Features.

=== Check if you have PowerShell

In recent versions of Windows, PowerShell is already installed and accessible through the link:https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/command-prompt-and-windows-powershell-for-windows-11-6453ce98-da91-476f-8651-5c14d5777c20[terminal] application.
At the time of writing, the pre-installed version is `5.1.22621.963`.
You can also install the latest version from the link:https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/powershell/9MZ1SNWT0N5D[Microsoft Store] (7.3.2 at the time of writing). +

You could also install PowerShell from GitHub by issuing the following command:

[,powershell]
----
winget show "Microsoft.PowerShell" -s winget
----

This would give an output similar to:

[,powershell]
----

You can see that the latest version is `7.3.2` and that the installer is a `.msi` file located on GitHub.
Just follow the link provided with your browser and install PowerShell from this file once it has downloaded.

== Build the MSI

=== Clone the Jenkins packaging repository

Choose your `git` tool and clone the https://github.com/jenkinsci/packaging.git[Jenkins packaging repository] on your machine.

=== Prepare the build

Open a `terminal` window and go to the folder where you cloned the repository.
For example `C:\jenkinsci\packaging\`.
You now have to declare where you downloaded the Jenkins war file, so the build script can find it.

[,powershell]
----
$env:War = "$env:USERPROFILE\jenkins.war"
----

If you have previously moved it into your repository clone folder, you can use this command instead:

[,powershell]
----
$env:War = "C:\jenkinsci\packaging\msi\build\jenkins.war"
----

=== Build the MSI

Enter the subfolder `msi\build` and run the following command:

[,powershell]
----
.\build.ps1
----

You should get an output similar to:

[,powershell]
----
