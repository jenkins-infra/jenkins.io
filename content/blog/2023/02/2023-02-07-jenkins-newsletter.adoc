Contributed by: author:kmartens27[Kevin Martens]

During the month of January, 98 pull requests were merged from 38  different authors.
We are also preparing for the 2023 edition of Google  Summer of Code, by encouraging folks to share ideas or join as mentors.
We published one blog post, which was the link:/blog/2023/01/12/jenkins-newsletter/[2022 recap] and contained tons of highlights for the last year of the Jenkins project.
Thanks to all of the new and returning contributors for their hard work already in the new year, and the continued efforts that are bound to happen.

Jenkins 2.375.2 released January 11, 2023.
Over 350 positive link:/changelog-stable/#v2.375.2[ratings] with only 1  issue reported to have required a rollback for 4 users.

The nine most recent Jenkins weekly releases (2.381 - 2.389) have received positive link:/changelog/#v2.389[ratings] as well, with 40-50 positive ratings and only 1 reported rollback in each of those 9 weekly releases.

Thanks to everyone that has done such great work on Jenkins core and its recent releases.

[[platform]]

Contributed by: author:gounthar[Bruno Verachten]

* Docker images
** New platforms:
*** UBI9 with JDK17 proposed and maintained by Oliver Gondza from RedHat, who's also maintainer of the UBI8 container image.
*** https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3318[Zombie images] fixed. Hurray!
*** Java updates were deployed to infra and container images (except for Windows containers):
**** 8u362
**** 11.0.18
**** 17.0.6
**** 19.0.2
* Debian 12 (“bookworm”) will not deliver OpenJDK 11.
** The end of life date for Debian’s openJDK11 won’t happen until 2026 or 2027.
** There is no urge to drop jdk11 support for Jenkins.
** We will change the documentation nonetheless when it goes out, so that  we describe the use of Jenkins with openJDK17.
* JDK Support for Jenkins
** Jenkins' enhancement proposal for required JDK11 is final!
Congrats.
