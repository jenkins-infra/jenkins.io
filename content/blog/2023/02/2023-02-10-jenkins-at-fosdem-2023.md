Intense. Free. Open. Diverse. Benevolent.

FOSDEM is the place to be for open-source developers. And Jenkins was there, too. We announced in various places we would be at FOSDEM 2023, and we were looking forward to meeting you all there.
I don't have official attendance figures from FOSDEM, but we had a huge number of visitors at our booth. We had a lot of fun talking to you, and we hope you had a great time, too.

Before FOSDEM, I made promises in various communities to try and see each other (Aaron from Ampere, TL Lim from Pine64, Daniel from OreBoot, Yassine and Sylvain from Worldline...). I'm happy to say that I kept my promises, and I had a great time talking to you all. I also have to say most of the people I wanted to meet came to the Jenkins booth to see me so that I did not have to search for them. So yes, if we want to fact-check, you helped me fulfill my promises, and not the other way around.
It was my first time at FOSDEM in-house (my first time ever was when I gave a talk during the 2021 COVID remote edition, but this kind of edition does not compare to the real McCoy) and I was really impressed by the diversity of the booths and the people. 

I was also impressed by the number of people who were interested in Jenkins. Quite a lot of visitors came to say "hi" and testify of their use or even love of Jenkins. Of course, most of them also had a question, and I was really relieved we had a bunch of Jenkins experts with us (yes, I'm looking at you Damien, Alexander, Hervé, Stéphane, Jean-Marc, Oleg, Olivier) so that no question went unanswered. I already knew about the variety of industries using Jenkins (generic embedded, automotive, aerospace, medical, energy, manufacturing, ...), but I discovered a few others like home automation (openHAB), and I was really mind-blown to see that Jenkins is used (and loved) in so many fields.
We even had testimony from someone using Jenkins for the CERN, the very same place the World Wide Web got designed and developed for scientists working in universities and institutes around the world.

I can also say lots of users wanted to know about Jenkins' near future. I'm happy to say that we have a lot of exciting things coming up, and I hope you will see them in your weekly releases soon.
You can of course be part of our open regular meetings regarding the UI/UX, platform, infrastructure, security, and documentation to learn everything while sitting in the front row or even while being on stage with us (spoiler alert, there is no such thing as rows and stage, we all are in the same circle). We are also looking for new contributors, so if you want to help the project and its community, consider joining our mailing lists and/our IRC channels.

We also had a lot of visitors who were not Jenkins users yet. Some of them didn't even know what Jenkins is. A few politely waited until the end of my explanations to let me know they were not interested in CI/CD. For some others, I witnessed some "Eureka/Ah, ah!" moments, and that was really rewarding. I know you're supposed to teach people to fish and not feed them directly the fish, but frankly, why let them cast a line when they have a turn-key solution available? Turn-key means that they have the key that opens the door to the aquarium full of fry... or a key to open a cardboard box encapsulating an IKEA-like fish.
The IKEA assembly instructions would be something like:

1. Use a free tier cloud provider.
2. Install docker. 
3. Use a simple docker-compose file.
4. Start docker-compose.
5. It was too fast to brew a coffee. Anyway, coffee and fish don't really match.
6. Enjoy your fish.

I had brought with me a little ice-breaker contraption (called miniJen), and it worked beyond all my expectations. I'll address that in another post, but this led to a lot of interesting discussions, and partnership ideas with other open-source/open-hardware communities. I'm really looking forward to seeing what will come out of that.

See you next year? Hopefully, we'll meet sooner elsewhere.
