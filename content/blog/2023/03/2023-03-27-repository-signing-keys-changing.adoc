Beginning March 28, 2023, the Jenkins weekly releases will use new repository signing keys for the Linux installation packages.
The same change will be made in Jenkins LTS releases beginning April 5, 2023.
Administrators of Linux systems *must* install the new signing keys on their Linux servers *before* installing Jenkins Jenkins weekly 2.397 or Jenkins LTS 2.387.2.

== Frequently Asked Questions

=== What if I don't update the repository signing key?

Updates may be *blocked* or interrupted by the operating system package manager (apt, yum, dnf) on operating systems that have not installed the new repository signing key.
Sample messages from the operating system may look like:

.Debian/Ubuntu
[source,bash]
----
Reading package lists... Done
W: GPG error: https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ Release:
    The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available:
        NO_PUBKEY FCEF32E745F2C3D5
E: The repository 'https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ Release' is not signed.
N: Updating from such a repository can't be done securely, and is therefore disabled by default.
N: See apt-secure(8) manpage for repository creation and user configuration details.

=== Why is the repository signing key being updated?

The repository signing key expires after 3 years so that it matches with the expiration dates of the jar file signing and the MSI signing certificate.
The updated GPG repository signing key is used in the weekly repositories and the stable repositories.

=== Which operating systems are affected?

Operating systems that use Debian package management (apt) and operating systems that use Red Hat package management (yum and dnf) need the new repository signing key.

Other operating systems like Windows, macOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, and OpenIndiana are not affected.
