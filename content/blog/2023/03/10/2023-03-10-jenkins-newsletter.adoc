=== FOSDEM 2023

Returning to FOSDEM for the first in-person event since COVID was both exciting and nostalgic for our Jenkins contributors.
It was exciting to see the same crowd size, and enthusiasm by attendees.
Many thanks to the wonderful FOSDEM organizers for yet another fantastic event!

[[infrastructure]]

Contributed by: author:dduportal[Damien Duportal]

Following the FOSDEM where most of the (infra) team was present physically, February was a busy month for the Jenkins Infrastructure:

- JFrog (repo.jenkins-ci.org) bandwidth reduction: Jenkins continuous integration jobs are now using significantly less internet bandwidth thanks to the artifact caching proxy implemented by the team.
The artifact caching proxy is implemented on our three cloud providers so that artifacts can be downloaded from a local cache rather than accessing the artifact repository.
- Jenkins LTS `2.375.3` is used on all of our controllers less than 3 days after its release
- All Jenkins deprecated plugins had been removed on all of our controllers (jquery, momentjs, ace-editor)
- All of our (six) Kubernetes clusters were upgraded from `1.23` to `1.24` baselines, in the three cloud providers
- All of the private and internal web services are using TLS with certificates provided by Let's Encrypt (with Azure DNS challenge)
- We contributed to Docker documentation after catching issues with Docker CE `23.x` fresh release and Docker BuildX (on Ubuntu)

We've also received numerous pull requests from contributors that are getting started with Jenkins, as well as several excited participants of the Google Summer of Code.
For all of the work and energy you're putting into the Jenkins project, we extend our deepest gratitude.

[[Governance]]

Contributed by: author:markewaite[Mark Waite]

The Jenkins governance board met once in February, resolved several action items, and noted the progress on projects with sponsors like JFrog and Atlassian.
We're sincerely grateful for the sponsorships provided by those generous companies and many other companies.

[[platform]]

Contributed by: author:gounthar[Bruno Verachten]

Ongoing work:

 - Centos `7` Jenkins Controller Docker Image proposal: deprecate the centos images.
We'll need an announcement and a https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep[JEP].
We'll also release a merged version of the `centos` and `centos7` image as the very last centos `7` Docker image.

Docker images:

* Latest updates on the agent images:
** ssh-agent: bump Git version on Windows to 2.39.2.windows.1 (https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-ssh-agent/pull/209[#209]) @github-actions
** docker-agent: bump Git version on Windows to 2.39.2.windows.1 (https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-agent/pull/376[#376]) @github-actions
** inbound agent:
*** bump the parent image jenkins/agent version to 3107.v665000b_51092-4 (https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-inbound-agent/pull/331[#331]) @github-actions
*** bump the parent image jenkins/agent version to 3107.v665000b_51092-3 (https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-inbound-agent/pull/330[#330]) @github-actions
*** bump updatecli/updatecli-action from 2.19.0 to 2.20.1 (https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-inbound-agent/pull/329[#329]) https://github.com/dependabot[@dependabot]
*** Windows controller image is not updated as often as the rest. It's been more than one year without any update. We may simply drop it.

* Debian 12 (“bookworm”) will not deliver OpenJDK 11
** The end of life date for Debian's openJDK11 won't happen until 2026 or 2027.
** The documentation will be updated when it goes out, so that we describe the use of Jenkins with openJDK17.

New platforms:

* RISC-V support is far from official for Jenkins, but tests are progressing.

Contributed by: author:markewaite[Mark Waite]

User experience improvements continued to arrive in February thanks to contributions from author:janfaracik[Jan Faracik], author:notmyfault[Alexander Brandes], author:timja[Tim Jacomb], https://github.com/mawinter69[Markus Winter], and others.
Look for the improvements in recent weekly releases and in the upcoming Jenkins `2.387.1` LTS release.

The pipeline graph viewer plugin continues to improve its user interface. See the video highlights in the https://community.jenkins.io/t/user-experience-sig-march-1-2023/6057[[.underline]#User Experience SIG recording#].. Build logs are now viewed from the main panel with easier navigation.

The security team has prepared the March 8, 2023 security release of Jenkins `2.394` (weekly), Jenkins `2.387.1` (LTS), and Jenkins `2.375.4` (previous LTS).
Special thanks to Daniel Beck and other security team members for their work on the upcoming release of Jenkins core and on plugin security reports.
