= Jira continues for Jenkins development

The Jenkins project has used link:https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira[Jira Software] for issue tracking since 2005.
Jira has been our issue and enhancement tracking system for almost as long as Jenkins core has existed.
Jenkins core and most Jenkins plugins track issues and enhancements through a link:https://issues.jenkins.io[Jira] instance hosted for the Jenkins project by the Linux Foundation.
