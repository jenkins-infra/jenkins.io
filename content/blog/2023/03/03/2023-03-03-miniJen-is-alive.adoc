= miniJen

The Jenkins multi-architecture CPU instance

== What is that contraption?

Nope, it's not a robot of some sort, it won't move by itself.
It's not https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebro[Cerebro] from Professor Xavier; no, it can't https://all3dp.com/2/raspbery-pi-drone-simply-explained/[fly] either.
What you're looking at is a Jenkins link:/doc/#what-is-jenkins[instance].
It is composed of a link:/doc/book/using/using-agents/#using-jenkins-agents[controller] (the "`brain`" or conductor) and three link:/doc/book/using/using-agents/[agents] (the workers or musicians if we continue a little further with the metaphor).

During https://fosdem.org/2023/[FOSDEM], we displayed the `aarch64` Jenkins controller dashboard on an another computer screen using the same Wi-Fi network.

These boards are not https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller[microcontrollers], they are miniature computers running https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux[GNU/Linux], like the famous https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi[Raspberry Pi].

This Jenkins instance was featured in the https://hackaday.com/2023/03/01/fosdem-2023-an-open-source-conference-literally/[Hackaday blog post] about FOSDEM.

== Hardware

The controller runs on a https://www.friendlyelec.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=287[NanoR5S], sold as a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)[router] (thus the three https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_connector#8P8C[RJ45] connectors).

image::/images/post-images/2023/03/03/2023-03-03-miniJen-is-alive/NanoPi_R5S-01B.png[NanoPi R5S pic from the manufacturer,500]

It's a 4GB https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AArch64[`aarch64`] (or `armv8`) https://wiki.friendlyelec.com/wiki/index.php/File:Rockchip_RK3568B2_Datasheet_V1.0.pdf[4 cores] running https://wiki.friendlyelec.com/wiki/index.php/FriendlyCore_(based_on_ubuntu-core_with_Qt)[friendlyCore], a distribution from the manufacturer (https://friendlyelec.com/[friendlyElec]) on a https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/ChangeLog-5.10[5.10.x kernel].

The smallest board is a 4 cores https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family#32-bit_architecture[`arm32`] agent with 512MB of RAM running https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armbian[Armbian] with a 5.10.x kernel too.

image::/images/post-images/2023/03/03/2023-03-03-miniJen-is-alive/NanoPi_Duo2-2.png[NanoPi Duo2 pic from the manufacturer,500]

It's also a board coming from the https://friendlyelec.com/[friendlyElec] manufacturer, the https://www.friendlyelec.com/index.php?route=product/product&path=69&product_id=244&sort=p.price&order=ASC[NanoPi Duo2].

The pink board next to the `arm32` board is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V[`RISC-V`] board running https://forum.armbian.com/topic/21465-armbian-image-and-build-support-for-risc-v/[Armbian] with just 1 core, 1GB of RAM and a https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/ChangeLog-6.1[6.1.x kernel].

image::/images/post-images/2023/03/03/2023-03-03-miniJen-is-alive/mq-pro.png[MangoPi MQ-Pro pic from the manufacturer,500]

It's a MangoPi https://mangopi.org/mqpro[MQ-Pro] from https://mangopi.org/[MangoPi], one of the first `RISC-V` boards available.

The latest board just next to the `RISC-V` board with a slightly different shade of pink is an `aarch64` board also from https://mangopi.org/[MangoPi].

image::/images/post-images/2023/03/03/2023-03-03-miniJen-is-alive/mq-quad.png[MangoPi MQ-Quad pic from a taobao store,500,link=https://world.taobao.com/item/662901818090.htm]

It is a 4 cores agent with 1GB of RAM running a fork of Armbian with https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/ChangeLog-5.16[kernel 5.16.x].
It's a https://mangopi.org/mqquad[MangoPi MQ-Quad].

== Don't try to fool me, there are no cables between the boards!

The boards all have Wi-Fi, and they are all connected to the same Wi-Fi network, provided by a router or my phone, depending on the location.
You can spot their small Wi-Fi antennas hanging in the first pic, except for the router which has no integrated Wi-Fi (it uses a https://www.realtek.com/en/products/communications-network-ics/item/rtl8821cu[USB Wi-Fi dongle] you can see in the pic).
One day, the R5S controller will also be a router for miniJen, but for now, it's just a Jenkins controller.
How come the controller can contact and control the agents? We're not using IP addresses, but hostnames ending in `.local`, thanks to the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avahi_(software)[Avahi] daemon.

== What is that big box with cables?

These boards are powered thanks to a https://www.pine64.org/[Pine64] https://www.pine64.org/pinepowerdesktop/[power supply].
Most of the time, you can see they don't use much current.

== 3D printed parts

The frame looks strange, I know. I wanted to use a torus because it's a cool-looking shape, and tentacles because it's even more cool-looking than a torus. +
It has been designed thanks to https://openscad.org/[openSCAD], an ... open-source https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design[computer-aided design] tool & language (yes, there is such a thing as 3D Design as code), and printed at home on a https://eryone.com/fdm/show/1.html[printer] running an open-source firmware, https://marlinfw.org/[Marlin].

Should you want to replicate this at home, you can find the https://github.com/MerryKombo/3DDesign/tree/MQ-Pro/assets/Booth%20Display[source code] on my https://github.com/gounthar[GitHub].

== Genesis and near future

I have made a few https://www.youtube.com/@jeanquinze/streams[live streams] during the build of miniJen, and should do some more for the upcoming modifications.
I also have a few videos on the same https://www.youtube.com/@jeanquinze/featured[channel] about Jenkins and other boards, so don't hesitate to have a look.
