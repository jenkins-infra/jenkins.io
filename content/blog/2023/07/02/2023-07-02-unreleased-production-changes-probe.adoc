== Introduction
Unreleased production changes probe looks for unreleased commits in the production files.

If an unreleased file is found in the production path, the probe returns a failure message. If no unreleased file is found, it returns a success message.

The probe commenced during the GSoC acceptance waiting period.

This is my first probe that went live as a GSoC contributor.

== Importance of the probe
Finding an unreleased production file can mean one or more of the following:

* The plugin may have undelivered bug fixes.
* The plugin may have stale features.
* The maintainer of the plugin maybe inactive.

== Probe details
The probe aims to identify unreleased production commits in `src/main` directory and `pom.xml` file.

== Challenges
Implementing https://www.eclipse.org/jgit/[JGit], a Java library that implements Git version control system was one of the biggest challenges I faced when working on this probe. Also, I was not familiar with Git hierarchy. I struggled to find the parent of a child commit using JGit.

In the end, my mentors suggested a pair programming session. We rewrote the probe together. I am thankful to their kindness and patience.

== Outcome
In the case when unreleased production files are found, the probe returns a list with their names and a failure message is returned. In the case when no unreleased production file is found, the probe returns a success message.

== Learning
* Learned to figure out unit test cases and implemented them.
* Implemented JGit Java library.
* Understood Git commit hierarchy.

== Conclusion

I once again realised that open-source world values quality. They are fine with fewer quality probes than many not so useful probes.

Starting from ground zero is tough. Be it implementing a new Java library or starting new work in some other field. With correct mentorship and guidance you can rise up faster.
