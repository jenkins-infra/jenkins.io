Jenkins has fully supported Java 17 since the 2.357 weekly release and 2.361.1 Long Term Support release.
For this reason, we have transitioned to using Java 17 in the Jenkins user handbook.
This includes the link:/doc/book/installing/[installation guides], link:/doc/book/pipeline/[Pipeline documentation], and link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/[Pipeline syntax].
Refer to the link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/issues/6310[GitHub issue] for additional information and insight.

== Background

Debian 12 was released on June 10, 2023, and it no longer delivers OpenJDK 11.
Due to this change in Debian, we have transitioned to using Java 17 in the documentation.
The idea is this will encourage users to upgrade to Java 17, which has been fully supported since September 2022.
Aligning with the actively supported Java version will also help prevent user confusion or frustration when trying to follow installation and usage guides.

== Advantages of Java 17

Java 17 improves upon Java 11 by including several new features that were not previously available.
Java 17 provides more functional testing and tools to help users improve their workflow and capabilities.
Including features that provide more extensive development options, such as:

* link:https://openjdk.org/jeps/406[Pattern matching for switch expressions]
* link:https://openjdk.org/jeps/409[Sealed classes]
* link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/jdk.incubator.foreign/jdk/incubator/foreign/package-summary.html[Foreign memory access]
* link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/time/Period.html[Day period support]
* link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/text/CompactNumberFormat.html[Compact number formatting support]
Read more about these features and how they can be used in the link:https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/17-relnote-issues.html[Java 17 release notes].

== Upgrading your Java version

While updating the documentation to reflect Java 17 support, we also added instructions on link:/doc/administration/requirements/upgrade-java-to-17/[upgrading Jenkins' Java version from 11 to Java 17].
This page includes a video walkthrough created by author:darinpope[Darin Pope] that guides users through the process of upgrading the Java version for Jenkins.

As always, update all installed plugins prior to _and_ after updating Jenkins in any way.
This ensures up-to-date plugins that remain compatible.
If plugins are not updated both before and after the upgrade, you can encounter compatibility issues.
