== Introduction

The Jenkins Security team offers a GitHub action that automatically scans the plugin source code during Continuous Integration and reports security issues.

The Jenkins community considers using such tools to ensure a high-security level for plugins as a good practice.

The Security Scan probe identifies whether the plugin is configured to execute the security action.

== Importance of the Probe

This probe is essential from a security perspective, as it checks for known security breaches and vulnerabilities in a plugin.

Its primary purpose is to verify that the security scan is properly configured in the plugin's GitHub Action.

== Challenges

This probe was originally started by another contributor.
However, they were unable to continue, so I took over their work.

Additionally, this probe required refactoring existing classes to eliminate code duplication, as the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/229[JEP-229 (Continuous Delivery)] probe also looks for CI configurations in GitHub Actions.

== Outcome

This probe will be beneficial to the security team, as it helps identify gaps and improve the security of the Jenkins plugin ecosystem.

== Learning

During this project, I accomplished the following:

* Successfully rebased an existing Git branch.
* Developed and wrote unit test cases.
* Gained knowledge on leveraging the class hierarchy to build an abstract probe that can be implemented by any probes requiring GitHub Action configuration checks.
