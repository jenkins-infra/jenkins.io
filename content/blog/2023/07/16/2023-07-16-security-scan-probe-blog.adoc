== Introduction
The Jenkins Security team provides a GitHub action to automatically scan the plugin source code during Continuous Integration, and report security issues.

It is considered a good practice by the Jenkins Community to use such tools to ensure a good security level of plugins.

Security Scan probe identifies whether the plugin is configured to execute the security action.

== Importance of the probe
This probe is important from the security perspective. As it looks for known security breaches and vulnerability in a plugin.

This probe ensures that the security scan is configured in the plugin's GitHub Action.

== Challenges
An existing contributor initiated this probe . For some reason they couldn't continue so I took over their work.

This probe also involved refactoring existing classes to avoid code duplication. As JEP-229 (Continuous  Delivery) probe looks for CI configurations in GitHub Actions as well.

== Outcome
This probe will be beneficial to the security team in identifying gaps and improve the security for Jenkins plugin ecosystem.

== Learning
Rebased an existing Git branch.
Wrote unit test cases.

Learned how to benefit from class hierarchy. Built an abstract probe that can be implemented by any probes that want to check their GitHub Action configuration.
