== Introduction

The Jenkins Security team offers a GitHub action that automatically scans the plugin source code during Continuous Integration and reports security issues.

Using such tools to ensure a high-security level for plugins is considered a good practice by the Jenkins Community.

The Security Scan probe identifies whether the plugin is configured to execute the security action.

== Importance of the Probe

This probe is essential from a security perspective as it checks for known security breaches and vulnerabilities in a plugin.

Its primary purpose is to verify that the security scan is properly configured in the plugin's GitHub Action.

== Challenges

This probe was initially initiated by an existing contributor, but for some reason, they couldn't continue, and I took over their work.

Additionally, this probe required refactoring existing classes to eliminate code duplication, as the JEP-229 (Continuous Delivery) probe also looks for CI configurations in GitHub Actions.

== Outcome

This probe will be beneficial to the security team as it helps identify gaps and improve the security of the Jenkins plugin ecosystem.

== Learning

During this project, I accomplished the following:
- Successfully rebased an existing Git branch.
- Developed and wrote unit test cases.
- Gained knowledge on leveraging the class hierarchy to build an abstract probe that can be implemented by any probes requiring GitHub Action configuration checks.
