Jenkins has fully supported Java 17 since the weekly release of 2.357 and Long Term Support release of 2.361.1.
For this reason, we have transitioned to using Java 17 in the Jenkins user handbook.
This includes the link:/doc/book/installing/[installation guides], link:/doc/book/pipeline/[Pipeline documentation], and link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/[Pipeline syntax].
Refer to the link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/issues/6310[GitHub issue] for additional information and insight.

== Background

Debian 12 was released on June 10, 2023 and no longer delivers OpenJDK 11.
Due to this change in how Debian is delivered, we have transitioned to using Java 17 in the documentation.
The idea is that this will encourage users to upgrade to Java 17, which has been fully supported since September 2022.
This is also intended to prevent confusion or frustration for users trying to follow installation and usage guides.

== The advantages of Java 17

Java 17 improves upon Java 11 by including several new features that were not previously available.
Java 17 provides more functional testing and tools to help users improve their workflow and capabilities.
Features such as text blocks, switch expressions, sealed classes, pattern matching, day period support, and compact number formatting support provide more extensive development options.
Read more about these features and how they can be used in the link:https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/17-relnote-issues.html[Java 17 release notes].

== Upgrading your Java version

While updating the documentation to reflect the Java 17 support, we have also added instructions on link:https://www.jenkins.io/doc/administration/requirements/upgrade-java-to-17/[upgrading Jenkins' Java version from 11 to Java 17].
This page includes a video walkthrough created by author:darinpope[Darin Pope], that guides users through the process of upgrading the Java version for Jenkins.

As always, make sure you update all installed plugins prior to _and_ after updating Jenkins in any way.
This ensures that plugins are up to date and compatible with the changes being made.
If plugins are not updated both before and after the upgrade, you can encounter compatibility issues.
