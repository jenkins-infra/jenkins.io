== Key Takeaways

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, and derivatives like CentOS 7, reach early end of life.
* Upgrades and improvements of Jenkins components continue with significant progress towards the eventual removal of Prototype.js from Jenkins core.
* Thanks to a kind donation from Launchable, pull requests to Jenkins core now complete their evaluation builds in 2 hours rather than the 6 hours that were previously required.

[[security-fixes]]

* There was one security advisory published on June 14
** link:/security/advisory/2023-06-14/[2023-06-14 Security Advisory]
** The security team discovered a vulnerability that was corrected as a (positive) side effect of a maintenance task.
There is no new security release per se for Jenkins Core, but an advisory and associated warnings to let administrators know that an update is recommended.
** That advisory also included fixes for plugins.
* Expansion of the security audit scope in Jenkins Core
** Originally the scope of the audit requirement was only “UI-related” changes.
** But recently, there were multiple changes in JavaScript / Jelly without a UI impact, mainly for maintenance.
** More information about this is in the link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QttPwdimNP_120JukigKsRuBvMr34KZhVfsbgq1HFLM[Jenkins UX SIG - Agendas & Notes], for June 21.
* Special thanks to the GitHub Security Lab for their reports
** This is the second time in a row that vulnerabilities they reported were corrected in the advisory.
** Kudos to Alvaro Muñoz and Tony Torralba for their work on this.
** In collaboration with them, the Jenkins Security team will improve the link:/blog/2020/11/04/codeql/[CodeQL scanning tool].

The Linux Foundation will upgrade link:https://issues.jenkins.io[issues.jenkins.io] on Thursday, July 6, 2023.
Special thanks to the Linux Foundation for their skilled administration of our JIRA instance.
More detailed information is available on the link:https://status.jenkins.io/issues/2023-07-06-jira-outage/[status page].

The four link:/projects/gsoc/#gsoc-2023[Google Summer of Code projects] mentored by members of the Jenkins project are preparing midterm presentations and midterm evaluations.
The link:https://www.meetup.com/jenkins-online-meetup/events/294355266/[midterm webinar] will be Thursday, July 6, 2023.
A recording will be available as well along with the link:https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1kfGd0IB2PWp_yzSDFk5ClY00qZGreGjirtqL7-SZ1js/edit?usp=sharing[presentation slides].

Upgrades and improvements of Jenkins components continue, with significant progress towards the eventual removal of Prototype.js from Jenkins core.
We’ve also seen upgrades for Guava, Guice, Apache commons.io, and HTMLUnit.
Thanks to the providers of those libraries and special thanks to the Jenkins maintainers that are leading those upgrades.

Thanks to a kind donation from link:https://www.launchableinc.com/[Launchable], pull requests to Jenkins core now complete their evaluation builds in 2 hours, rather than the 6 hours that were previously required.
Launchable uses AI techniques to select a time-limited subset of tests, executed as part of pull request evaluation.
Special thanks to author:basil[Basil Crow] for implementing Launchable in the Jenkins project.

The CDF Technical Oversight Committee elections have finished.
The Jenkins project nominee, author:markewaite[Mark Waite], has been elected to serve.
We’re pleased that the Jenkins project continues to have representation on the committee.

* The Cloud Costs Control effort continued:
** We kept the AWS bill at $11,000 while the build workload of ci.jenkins.io increased by 15%.
** We also decreased the Azure bill by $2,000 ($9,000 -> $7,000) despite adding (more) resources.
* For the build workload migration to ARM64: link:https://javadoc.jenkins.io[javadoc.jenkins.io] is now proudly served by Azure ARM64 instances.
* link:/changelog-stable/[Jenkins LTS]' 2.401.1 and 2.401.2 were deployed everywhere less than 24 hours after their releases.
* link:https://ubuntu.com/blog/ubuntu-18-04-eol-for-devices[Ubuntu 18.04 Bionic end of life]: All of our VMs are now using Ubuntu 22.04, except the Update Center one.
* Cloud Control:
** The trusted.ci.jenkins.io and puppet.jenkins.io systems were migrated to Azure for security.
** AWS is only used by ci.jenkins.io for container agents. This means no more EC2.
* IPv6 support for get.jenkins.io and every other public services, thanks to their migration to a brand new AKS cluster with dual stack enabled.


[[modern-ui]]

Contributed by: author:markewaite[Mark Waite]

User experience improvements continue thanks to the efforts of link:https://github.com/mawinter69[Markus Winter], author:janfaracik[Jan Faracik], link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pulls/meiswjn[Jan Meiswinkel], and others.

Markus is improving the look and feel of the delete dialog, so that it will be consistent and will appear within the web page as a modal dialog, rather than appearing outside the page as a browser dialog.

Jan Faracik continues to improve the look and feel of Jenkins pages, including recent improvements to the logs page and improvement in the cascading style sheets.

[[documentation]]
image:/images/post-images/2023/02/07/2023-02-07-jenkins-newsletter/documentation.png[Documentation Update]
Contributed by: author:kmartens27[Kevin Martens]

During the month of June, three blog posts were published on the Jenkins blog.
This included the link:/blog/2023/06/20/jenkins-may-newsletter/[May newsletter], an link:/blog/2023/06/22/mirrors-jenkins-new-IP/[update announcement for Jenkins mirrors], and instructions on link:/blog/2023/06/20/remove-outdated-plugins-while-using-docker/[removing deprecated plugins from Jenkins when using Docker].

The documentation has also started to transition to using Java 17 in the installation documentation for various platforms.
The link:/doc/book/installing/linux/[Linux installation documentation] has been updated accordingly and includes a note regarding the Debian 12 release (as it does not deliver OpenJDK 11).
This note will be present on any page that is part of the transition so that users are aware of the updates.

As always, we appreciate all the documentation contributions from new and existing users.
Thank you for your work and dedication to the open source community!
