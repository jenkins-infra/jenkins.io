== Introduction

Bots are used to automate tasks in a plugin. Plugin Health Scoring Systems tracks usage of two bots - Dependabot, link:https://docs.renovatebot.com/[Renovate].

Renovate probe checks whether Renovate is configured in a plugin.

== Importance of the probe

This a community requested probe to track the usage of Renovate.

The pull requests created by Renovate will be counted when scoring the probe.

== Challenges

This probe required creating an `abstract` class and reconfiguring the Dependabot class to use the new `abstract` class.

Having worked on a similar case in the previous probe, this probe was easy to complete.

== Outcome

The probe is successfully merged and live into production.

== Conclusion

The probe will help identify usage of Renovate in the plugin.
