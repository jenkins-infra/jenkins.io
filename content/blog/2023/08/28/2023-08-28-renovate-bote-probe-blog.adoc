== Introduction

Bots are used to automate tasks in a plugin.
The Plugin Health Scoring System tracks usage of two bots - link:https://github.com/dependabot[Dependabot] and link:https://docs.renovatebot.com/[Renovate].

The renovate probe checks whether Renovate is configured in a plugin.

== Importance of the probe

This a community requested probe to track the usage of Renovate.
The pull requests created by Renovate will be counted when scoring the probe.

== Challenges

The renovate probe required creating an `abstract` class and reconfiguring the Dependabot class to use the new `abstract` class.

Having worked on a similar case in the previous probe, this probe was easy to complete.

== Outcome and Conclusion

The probe has been successfully merged and pushed into production.
The probe will help identify usage of Renovate in plugins.
