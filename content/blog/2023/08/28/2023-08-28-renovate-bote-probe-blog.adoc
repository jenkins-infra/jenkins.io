== Introduction

Bots are used to automate tasks in a plugin.
The Plugin Health Scoring System tracks usage of two bots - link:https://github.com/dependabot[Dependabot] and link:https://docs.renovatebot.com/[Renovate].

Dependabot looks for dependencies that are outdated in a plugin.
It can also raise a security alert if a security breach is found, like when the code depends on an insecure package.

Renovate provides automated dependency updates.
It can also schedule PRs and customize behavior using configuration files.


== Importance of the probe

This is a community requested probe to track the usage of Renovate.
Bot tracking probes help in identifying which bot is used most by the plugins.
In the future, the probe will aid in decision-making when the need arises to add or remove a bot.

The pull requests created by Renovate will be counted when scoring the probe.

== Challenges

The renovate probe required creating an `abstract` class and reconfiguring the Dependabot class to use the new `abstract` class.

`Dependabot` and `Renovate` probes both had similar functionality: finding their respective configuration in `GitHub` workflow.

The tasks were as follows:

- Identify the similarity in both probes.
- Reuse the existing `Dependabot` probe code in the new `abstract` class.
- Write abstract methods that should be implemented in both the child classes to allow for code reusability.

Having implemented a similar class in the link:../../07/16/2023-07-16-security-scan-probe-blog.adoc[Security Scan] probe, this probe was easy to complete.

== Outcome and Conclusion

The probe has been successfully merged and pushed into production.
The probe will help identify usage of Renovate in plugins.
