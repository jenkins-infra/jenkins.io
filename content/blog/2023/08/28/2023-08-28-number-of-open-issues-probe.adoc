== Introduction

An alarming number of issues in a plugin may signify that the plugin is outdated, in need of a new maintainer, or in need of a complete revamp.
Open issues might also mean that there are a lot of new feature requests, which in turn means the plugin has quite a number of active users.
The number of open issue probe counts the number of open issues in the issue tackers.

NOTE: As of now, the probe only counts open issues in GitHub and the JIRA issue tacker.

== Importance of the probe

The goal of the probe is to help maintainers and contributors identify plugins they want to invest their time into.
This would lead to maintainers keeping plugins updated and useful for the users.

== Tasks and Challenges

During the Google Summer of Code project duration, I was intended to:

- Figure out the correct class design.
- Understand the Update Center and how it works.
- Implement the link:https://github-api.kohsuke.org/[GitHub] and link:https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/rest-apis/[JIRA] APIs.

== Outcome

The probe was approved and ready to be merged.

== Learning

Over the course of the project, I learned about the correct usage and implementation of the `abstract` class.
This was a more complex version of the class I was used to.

== Conclusion
This probe will help maintainers in identifying the number of open issues a plugin has.
This will also keep the plugin relevant to the latest Jenkins updates.
