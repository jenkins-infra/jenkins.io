= Linux containers rebuilt

A Jenkins job mistakenly rebuilt the Linux container images for recent Jenkins weekly releases and recent Jenkins LTS releases.
Users that downloaded some of those Linux container images received container images that could not run the Jenkins controller.
The incorrect container images would fail to run with the message that Jenkins is not supported with Java 8.

[source]
----
Running with Java 8 from /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8-openjdk/jre,
which is older than the minimum required version (Java 11).
Supported Java versions are: [11, 17, 21]

== Corrected Linux container images

The Linux container images for Jenkins 2.419, 2.401.1, 2.401.2, and 2.401.3 have been rebuilt August 21, 2023.

Container images for Jenkins agents are not affected.

More details are available in the original https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker/issues/1690[issue report].
