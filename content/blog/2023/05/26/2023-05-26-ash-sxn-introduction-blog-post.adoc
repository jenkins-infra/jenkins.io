Hello, Jenkins community! I am really excited to be a GSoC 2023 contributor for Docker-based Jenkins quickstart examples project. In this blog post, I will take you through the details of the project in the following: 

== Project Description

The Docker-based Jenkins Quickstart Examples project aims to provide a quick and easy way for users to get started with Jenkins using Docker.
By providing user-friendly Docker Compose files and updating the documentation, we make it simple for beginners to set up Jenkins and start exploring its features.
These files will be regularly tested on `ci.jenkins.io` to ensure reliability and functionality. 
The Pipeline Steps doc generator will be used to maintain up-to-date documentation, and Gitpod will facilitate quickstart with a `.gitpod.yml` file running `docker-compose` commands, enabling easy preview of Jenkins instances.

Our goal is to enhance the user experience and make it more seamless and efficient for users to become familiar with Jenkins using Docker.
The current quickstart process with Jenkins using the existing Docker examples can be complex and challenging for new users, with lots of `docker` commands to follow and hard-to-understand documentation.
This project aims to address these issues and make it easier for users to get started with Jenkins.

=== Introduction
I am an IT undergraduate from India, I just gave my second year exams so I’ll be a third year student after this summer.
I have a keen interest in DevOps and Cybersecurity. I heard of open source in my freshman year and loved the Idea of free and open software for all. 

== Why Jenkins?

I got to know of Jenkins while I was learning DevOps and after learning about Open Source I was eager to start contributing and be a part of a community.
And Jenkins was built on Java which was the first language that I have learned. So I started to look into the Jenkins community.
In the beginning, I couldn’t understand much about the issues and that’s where Hacktoberfest came into the picture. 
It was the push that I needed to submit my first PR, and I also got a T-shirt from the participation too.
During Hacktoberfest the playlist about modernizing jenkins plugins by author:markewaite[Mark Waite] and author:darinpope[Darin Pope] was really helpful. 
After that I saw a post about Jenkins participating in GSoC 2023.
That's when I started to look into GSoC, and during preparation of the GSoC proposal the community helped me a lot and nudged me in the right direction to learn new things and reviewed my proposal. 

=== Engaging with the community
I plan to give my all this summer to complete GSoC successfully and learn a lot of new things from the community, especially the communication part as I am not that good at it. I’ll give my all. 
And I hope that my contribution this summer can have a positive impact on the community. 
How I’d plan to be a part of community after GSoC:

* I’d like to participate in events like Hacktoberfest to help others become part of the community. 
* I’d like to work on my original goal of improving my Java skills through contributions to the Jenkins core. 
* I’d like to adopt a plugin. 
* I’d like to participate in GSoC as a mentor in the future from Jenkins. 

== Conclusion
I want to thank the community for selecting me for GSoC 2023 and helping me to prepare for it. And special thanks to my mentors for giving their precious time and mentoring me this summer.
I hope my contributions will be a useful addition to Jenkins.  
I’m looking forward to working with you all this summer!
