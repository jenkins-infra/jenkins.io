This is Harsh Pratap Singh, an Open source enthusiast, who is currently in his freshman year exploring different technologies related to DevSecOps and Blockchain.
I am curious and passionate about automation thus Jenkins is my goto Open Source organization for Google Summer of Code.
This is my first time contributing to Open Source and I am already loving it.
I am fortunate enough to get selected in Google Summer of Code 2023 and I am looking forward to a thrilling summer.

== About the Project 
I will be working on GitLab Plugin Modernization project which primarily aims to replace the use of old RESTEasy with modern GitLab4J-API library via the GitLab API Jenkins library plugin.
After this migration, the Jenkins Community will experience improved performance, better maintenance and support, and increased functionality and flexibility in the Gitlab-Plugin.
I am optimistic and excited to collaborate with the Jenkins community and learn from the experienced mentors and community members for successful completion of the Project.

For more details related to the project, you can refer to the

== Conclusion
I want to express by gratitude towards my mentors and org admins for their constant guidance and support.
I sincerely hope that I will be able to help Jenkins community prosper with my contributions and create a positive impact.
