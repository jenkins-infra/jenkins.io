= End of life operating systems

Beginning with Jenkins 2.407, May 30, 2023 and Jenkins 2.401.2, June 28, 2023, Jenkins administrators will be warned if they are running Jenkins on an operating system that is within 6 months of its link:https://endoflife.date/[end of life date].

The warning includes the date when Jenkins will no longer be supported on that operating system version.
It advises the administrator to upgrade to a newer version of the operating system.

Jenkins container images based on CentOS 7 will no longer be supported after *Nov 16, 2023*.
