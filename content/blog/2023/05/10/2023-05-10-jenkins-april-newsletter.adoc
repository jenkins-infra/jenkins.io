Thanks to DigitalOcean for their continued support!

*Jenkins in Google Summer of Code (GSoC)*

We had an unprecedented number of GSoC applicants interested in Jenkins this year.
The Jenkins project received over 60 proposals by the close of the application period.
Dedicated Jenkins mentors worked overtime and weekends to review and grade proposals within a two weeks period.
Many THANKS to the wonderful Jenkins mentors, this program isn't possible without them.

Best of luck to all GSoC participants!
