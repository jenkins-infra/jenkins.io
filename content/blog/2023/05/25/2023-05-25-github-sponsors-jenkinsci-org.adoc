= GitHub sponsors the Jenkins project

The Jenkins project has used link:http://github.com/[GitHub] since 2007.
GitHub has been our source code hosting and management platform for almost as long as Jenkins has existed.
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins[Jenkins core] and all its plugins live on GitHub.

We are pleased to announce that GitHub sponsors the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins[`jenkinsci`] GitHub organization with enterprise features, such as link:https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/configuring-autolinks-to-reference-external-resources[autolink references].

If you are a Jenkins plugin maintainer, you can now use autolink references to link to Jenkins Jira issues.
All you need to do is heading to the "Settings" tab of your GitHub repository and add the following configuration to the "Autolink references" section:

```
Numeric
Reference prefix: JENKINS-
Target URL: https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-<num>
```
