== Governance Update

Contributed by: https://github.com/MarkEWaite[Mark Waite]

The Jenkins governance board thanks Ewelina Wilkosz and Gavin Mogan for their two years of service as board members.
We’re so glad to have talented people on the Jenkins governance board.

December 2022 brings two new members to the Jenkins governance board.

We welcome Dr. Ullrich Hafner of the Department of Computer Science and Mathematics at the Munich University of Applied Sciences is a new member of the board.
In his role as professor he tries to win new Jenkins contributors by letting students develop new features and test cases in their student projects and thesis.
He has been an active contributor in the Jenkins project since 2007, mostly in the acceptance test harness and the static code analysis suite (which is now replaced by the Warnings Next Generation Plugin).

We also welcome Alexander Brandes as a new member of the board.
Alexander is a Jenkins core maintainer, and the maintainer of the Job Configuration History and Ionicons API plugin.

He is a release team member and actively involved in the process of releasing Jenkins weekly and long term support (LTS) builds.
He served as release lead for five of the twelve Jenkins LTS releases in 2022.

In addition to two new members of the governance board, we welcome the new documentation officer, Kevin Martens.
Kevin leads the Documentation office hours, reviews and merges documentation pull requests, and is actively involved in Jenkins special interest groups.

Contributed by: https://github.com/MarkEWaite[Mark Waite]

Jenkins LTS and weekly releases in 2022 have included significant user experience improvements thanks to the work of Jan Faracik, Tim Jacomb, Alex Brandes, Daniel Beck, and many others. Table layouts, menu entries, icons, themes, breadcrumbs, and more have been updated to give Jenkins a new, fresh look in 2022.

== Documentation Update

Contributed by: https://github.com/kmartens27[Kevin Martens]

This year, we saw documentation contributions from new and seasoned Jenkins users.
These contributions included blog posts, documentation additions and updates, documentation migration, and other improvements.
All of this combined has helped expand and empower the Jenkins community.

The Jenkins project saw 48 blog posts, submitted by 23 different authors, and overall 814 PRs were merged.
The contributions are a result of the community and collaboration, with various projects throughout the year such as She Code Africa, Google Summer of Code, and Hacktoberfest.

=== Pipeline Steps Reference

Thanks to the work of https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/vihaanthora/[Vihaan Thora], contributing via https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2022/10/10/pipeline-steps-improvement-gsoc-report/#project-specific-guidance[Google Summer of Code], the https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/[Pipeline steps] documentation has been improved.
The Pipeline Steps reference guide is invaluable for developers when working in Jenkins and utilizing plugins.
The updates include search functionality, overall appearance, and a reduction in page load.

=== Algolia search

image:/images/post-images/2023/01/10/jenkins-newsletter/image6.png[image,width=275,height=52]

The Jenkins site search has been updated to use the latest version of https://www.algolia.com/[Algolia].
We want to recognize and thank https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/halkeye/[Gavin Mogan] for all of his work on this and Algolia for donating the search functionality.
The site search now provides more relevant results and suggestions for users.
