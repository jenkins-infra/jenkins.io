== Governance Update

Contributed by: https://github.com/MarkEWaite[Mark Waite]

The Jenkins governance board thanks Ewelina Wilkosz and Gavin Mogan for their two years of service as board members.
We’re so glad to have talented people on the Jenkins governance board.

December 2022 brings two new members to the Jenkins governance board.

We welcome Dr. Ullrich Hafner of the Department of Computer Science and Mathematics at the Munich University of Applied Sciences as a new member of the board.
In his role as professor, he tries to win new Jenkins contributors by letting students develop new features and test cases in their student projects and thesis.
He has been an active contributor in the Jenkins project since 2007, mostly in the acceptance test harness and the static code analysis suite (which is now replaced by the Warnings Next Generation Plugin).

We also welcome Alexander Brandes as a new member of the board.
Alexander is a Jenkins core maintainer and maintainer of the Job Configuration History and Ionicons API plugins.

He is a release team member and actively involved in the process of releasing Jenkins weekly and long term support (LTS) builds.
He served as release lead for five of the twelve Jenkins LTS releases in 2022.

In addition to two new members of the governance board, we welcome the new documentation officer, Kevin Martens.
Kevin leads the Documentation office hours, reviews and merges documentation pull requests, and is actively involved in Jenkins special interest groups.

image:/images/post-images/2023/01/10/jenkins-newsletter/Security.png[Security Update]

Contributed by: https://github.com/Wadeck[Wadeck Follonier]

The Jenkins security team was incredibly active this year, not only in resolving security concerns, but also providing insight to users through security advisories.
The information below provides overall statistics from the Security team in 2022.
Publication

* 16 Security advisories (stable year over year).
** Only 5 impacting Jenkins core (also stable).

* Around 400 CVEs published (more than all the previous years).

Day to day job of the security team:

* Around 580 SECURITY tickets handled.
** Which is ~20% of the total number of tickets since 2009.

* Around 70 hosting requests proactively audited (introduced in Q2 of 2022).
* Around 80 UI related PRs audited in Jenkins core (introduced in Q3 of 2022).

We have more and more CVEs with a name (e.g. https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2022/03/31/spring-rce-CVE-2022-22965/[CVE-2022-22965]) to analyze and answer questions about.

Delivery

* General availability for the Jenkins custom rules in CodeQL (https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-dev/c/OMe_zN8-Tkc/m/5Tf0OnNWAgAJ[message]).
* Improved tooling for the SECURITY tickets handling.

Contributed by: https://github.com/dduportal[Damien Duportal]

2022 was an eventful year for the Jenkins Infrastructure team as well, leading to various updates and additions.

* Ci.jenkins.io now has:
** General availability for Windows 2022 server use.
** JDK19 availability for developers which provides faster testing and  edge testing.
** Kubernetes has been upgraded to version 1.23 which supports Azure, AWS, and DigitalOcean.
* The link:https://jfrog.com/[JFrog] sponsored migration of repo.jenkins-ci.org to their new AWS platform which provides improved performances for artifact downloads.
* Download mirrors (get.jenkins.io):
** A new download mirror for Jenkins was added in Asia. We want to thank link:https://servanamanaged.com/[Servana] for providing the mirror!
** The mirror mirror.gruenehoelle.nl, located in the Netherlands, that had been available previously has been decommissioned.
Thank you for the service!
* The Infrastructure team was also able to review and clean up some unused Azure resources, which led to $1,000 of monthly savings!



image:/images/post-images/2023/01/10/jenkins-newsletter/Platform Modernization.png[Platform Modernization Update]

Contributed by: https://github.com/gounthar[Bruno Verachten]

Several upgrades were made better modernize the Jenkins platform.
These include:
* Java 11 is now required for Jenkins platform and plugin development.
** https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2022/12/14/require-java-11/[Build toolchain changes] arrived in parent pom 4.52.
** Java 11 not only provides a better baseline to work from, but also ensures that the benefits, such as performance and memory improvements, are felt across the platform.
** Jenkins now has more Java 11 installations than Java 8 installations of Jenkins core! image:/images/post-images/2023/01/10/jenkins-newsletter/image4.png[image,width=403,height=275]
* Jenkins now fully supports Java 17.
** Previously Java 17 had been available only in a preview mode, but with the LTS release of 2.361.1, Java 17 functionality is fully available in Jenkins.
* Migrate Linux installation packages from System V init to systemd.
** This migration has been requested previously by users since 2017.
The end result of the migration provides unification of service management implementation and better integration between Jenkins core and service management framework.
* Staying on top of new backend and frontend dependency updates provides better testing, processing, and performance across Jenkins.
* Container image updates:
** We added new platform support such as arm/v7 and aarch64. 
** The support for ppc64le was removed.
** The final, definitive version of the containers for JDK8.
**  The blueocean container image was deprecated.
** The deprecated install-plugins.sh script was removed from Docker images.
** There were also "Exit" and "Restart" lifecycle changes in the Docker images.
* The ANTLR 2 grammars and code were upgraded to ANTLR 4, making it easier for Jenkins to read and parse through various programing languages.
This also means Jenkins core now compiles with more languages!
** Thanks to Alex Earl and Basil Crow for all of their hard work on completing this transition!
** This was also included in Jenkins weekly release 2.376.
* Platform documentation
** A short https://www.jenkins.io/doc/administration/requirements/servlet-containers/#sidebar-content[guide] about web containers and servlet container support was created.
* Platform in progress work:
** For further development, experiments with RISC-V agents with JDK17/19/20 need to be performed.
** Further experimenting with Windows 2022 server need to be performed as well.

=== CrowdIn for plugin localization
Thanks to Alexander Brandes for helping get link:https://crowdin.com/enterprise[CrowdIn] connected with link:https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/crowdin/crowdin-integration/#setup-a-crowdin-project[Jenkins].
This will make the plugin localization process much easier, allowing for any user to translate/localize plugin documentation.
link:https://crowdin.jenkins.io/[This page] shows the plugins that are currently open and being worked on.
It also provides some insight as to how many changes have been made and how many people have been contributing to the project.

Contributed by: https://github.com/kmartens27[Kevin Martens]

This year, we saw documentation contributions from new and seasoned Jenkins users.
These contributions included blog posts, documentation additions and updates, documentation migration, and other improvements.
All of this combined has helped expand and empower the Jenkins community.

The Jenkins project saw 48 blog posts, submitted by 23 different authors, and overall 814 PRs were merged.
The contributions are a result of the community and collaboration, with various projects throughout the year such as She Code Africa, Google Summer of Code, and Hacktoberfest.

=== Pipeline Steps Reference

Thanks to the work of https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/vihaanthora/[Vihaan Thora], contributing via https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2022/10/10/pipeline-steps-improvement-gsoc-report/#project-specific-guidance[Google Summer of Code], the https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/[Pipeline steps] documentation has been improved.
The Pipeline Steps reference guide is invaluable for developers when working in Jenkins and utilizing plugins.
The updates include search functionality, overall appearance, and a reduction in page load.

=== Algolia search

image:/images/post-images/2023/01/10/jenkins-newsletter/image6.png[image,width=275,height=52]

The Jenkins site search has been updated to use the latest version of https://www.algolia.com/[Algolia].
We want to recognize and thank https://www.jenkins.io/blog/authors/halkeye/[Gavin Mogan] for all of his work on this and Algolia for donating the search functionality.
The site search now provides more relevant results and suggestions for users.
A visual update was included as part of the upgrade, resulting in the new look and UI.

image:/images/post-images/2023/01/10/jenkins-newsletter/Projects.png[Community and Stories site update]

In 2022, the Jenkins project was able to collaborate on and complete several other projects.
This includes launching two new sites for community engagement and involvement:

* link:https://community.jenkins.io/[community.jenkins.io] now provides a space for community discourse and communication.

* link:https://stories.jenkins.io/[stories.jenkins.io] is a site dedicated to sharing the experiences and stories of Jenkins users, developers, contributors, or anyone else that Jenkins has impacted.

Additionally, Jenkins participated in the link:https://www.jenkins.io/sigs/gsoc/[Google Summer of Code], link:https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2022/04/11/She-Code-Africa-contributhon/[She Code Africa], and link:https://www.jenkins.io/events/hacktoberfest/[Hacktoberfest] projects.
This participation allowed us to create and connect with new Jenkins users all over the globe, improve several areas of Jenkins, and celebrate the successes of the community.
