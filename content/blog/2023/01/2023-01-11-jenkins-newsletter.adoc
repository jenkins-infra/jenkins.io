The Jenkins governance board thanks author:ewelinawilkosz[Ewelina Wilkosz] and author:halkeye[Gavin Mogan] for their two years of service as board members.
We're so glad to have talented people serve on the Jenkins governance board.

December 2022 brought two new members to the Jenkins governance board.

We welcome author:uhafner[Dr. Ullrich Hafner] of the Department of Computer Science and Mathematics at the Munich University of Applied Sciences as a new member of the board.
In his role as professor, he tries to win new Jenkins contributors by letting students develop new features and test cases in their student projects and theses.
He has been an active contributor in the Jenkins project since 2007, mostly in the acceptance test harness and the static code analysis suite (which is now replaced by the Warnings Next Generation Plugin).

We also welcome link:https://github.com/NotMyFault[Alexander Brandes] as a new member of the board.
Alexander is a Jenkins core maintainer and the maintainer of the link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/jobConfigHistory/[Job Configuration History] and link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/ionicons-api/[Ionicons API] plugins.

He is a release team member and actively involved in Jenkins long term support releases and weekly releases.
He served as release lead for five of the twelve Jenkins LTS releases in 2022.

In addition to two new members of the governance board, we welcome the new documentation officer, author:kmartens27[Kevin Martens].
Kevin leads Jenkins documentation office hours, reviews and merges documentation pull requests, and is actively involved in Jenkins special interest groups.

Contributed by: author:wadeck[Wadeck Follonier]

The Jenkins security team was incredibly active this year, not only in resolving security concerns, but also providing insight to users through security advisories.
The information below provides overall statistics from the Security team in 2022.

=== Publication

* link:/security/advisories/#2022[16 Security advisories] (stable year over year).
** Only 5 impacting Jenkins core (also stable).
* Around 400 CVEs published, which was more than all previous years.

=== Day to day:

* Approximately 580 SECURITY tickets handled.
** Which is ~20% of the total number of tickets since 2009.
* Around 70 hosting requests proactively audited (introduced in Q2 of 2022).
* Around 80 UI related PRs audited in Jenkins core (introduced in Q3 of 2022).

We have even more CVEs with a name, such as link:/blog/2022/03/31/spring-rce-CVE-2022-22965/[CVE-2022-22965], to analyze and understand.

=== Delivery

* General availability for the Jenkins custom rules in CodeQL (https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-dev/c/OMe_zN8-Tkc/m/5Tf0OnNWAgAJ[message]).
* Improved tooling for the SECURITY tickets handling.

Contributed by: author:dduportal[Damien Duportal]

2022 was an eventful year for the Jenkins Infrastructure team as well, leading to various updates and additions.

* Ci.jenkins.io now has:
** General availability for Windows 2022 server use.
** JDK19 availability for developers, providing new functionalities and edge testing options.
** Kubernetes has been upgraded to version 1.23 to support Azure, AWS, and DigitalOcean.
* The link:https://jfrog.com/[JFrog] sponsored migration of link:https://repo.jenkins-ci.org/ui/[repo.jenkins-ci.org] to their new AWS platform, which provides improved performance for artifact downloads.
* Download mirrors (link:https://get.jenkins.io/war/2.386/jenkins.war?mirrorstats[get.jenkins.io]):
** A new download mirror for Jenkins was added in Asia. We want to thank link:https://servanamanaged.com/[Servana] for providing the mirror!
** The mirror mirror.gruenehoelle.nl, located in the Netherlands, that had been available previously has been decommissioned.
Thank you for the service!

* The Infrastructure team was also able to review and clean up unused Azure resources, leading to $1,000 of monthly savings!



image:/images/post-images/2023/01/11/jenkins-newsletter/Platform-Modernization.png[Platform Modernization Update]

Contributed by: author:gounthar[Bruno Verachten]

Several upgrades were made to modernize the Jenkins platform.
These include:

* Java 11 is now required for Jenkins platform and plugin development.
** link:/blog/2022/12/14/require-java-11/[Build toolchain changes] arrived in parent pom 4.52.
** Java 11 provides a better baseline to work from, ensuring that the benefits, such as performance and memory improvements, are felt across the platform.
** Jenkins now has more Java 11 installations than Java 8 installations of Jenkins core!
+
image:/images/post-images/2023/01/11/jenkins-newsletter/image4.png[image,width=403,height=275]
* Jenkins now fully supports Java 17.
** Previously, Java 17 was only available in a preview mode, but with the LTS release of link:/changelog-stable/#v2.361.1[2.361.1], Java 17 functionality is fully available in Jenkins.
* Migration of Linux installation packages from System V init to `systemd`.
** Users have requested this migration since 2017.
The link:/blog/2022/03/25/systemd-migration/#motivation[goals of the migration] were achieved; to provide unification of service management implementation and better integration between Jenkins core and service management framework.
** Thanks to Basil Crow for his work on the migration. 
* Staying on top of new backend and frontend dependency updates providing better testing, processing, and performance across Jenkins.
* Container image updates:
** Added new platform support, such as arm/v7 and aarch64.
** Removed support for ppc64le.
** Released the final, definitive version of the JDK8 containers.
** Deprecated the blueocean container image.
** Removed the deprecated install-plugins.sh script from Docker images.
** There were also "Exit" and "Restart" lifecycle changes in the Docker images.
* The ANTLR 2 grammars and code were upgraded to ANTLR 4, making it easier for Jenkins to read and parse through various programing languages.
This means Jenkins core can now compile with more languages!
** Thanks to Alex Earl and Basil Crow for all of their hard work on completing this transition!
** This was included in Jenkins weekly release 2.376.
* Platform documentation
** A short link:/doc/administration/requirements/servlet-containers/#sidebar-content[guide] about web containers and servlet container support was created.
* Platform in progress work:
** For further development, experiments with RISC-V agents with JDK17/19/20 need to be performed.
** Additional experimenting with Windows 2022 server needs to be performed as well.

=== CrowdIn for plugin localization
Thanks to Alexander Brandes for helping get link:https://crowdin.com/enterprise[CrowdIn] connected with link:/doc/developer/crowdin/crowdin-integration/#setup-a-crowdin-project[Jenkins].
This will make the plugin localization process easier, allowing for any user to contribute to localizing plugin documentation.
link:https://crowdin.jenkins.io/[This page] shows the plugins that have localization work currently open.
It also provides some insight as to how many changes have been made and how many people have been contributing to the project.

=== UTF-8 encoding

The Jenkins project also updated how it reads jelly files, making the transition to using UTF-8.
This was possible once the transition to Java 11 completed.
By utilizing UTF-8, developers and users can build more reliably and have modern property files read correctly.
This also aligns Jenkins' ability to read different types of property files, provided the encoding is the same.

This year, the Jenkins project saw documentation contributions from new and seasoned Jenkins users.
These contributions included blog posts, documentation additions and updates, documentation migration, and other improvements.
All of this has helped expand and empower the Jenkins community.

Over the year, Jenkins project saw 48 blog posts, submitted by 23 different authors.
There were 814 contributions throughout 2022.
These contributions are a result of the community and collaboration with various projects throughout the year, such as She Code Africa, Google Summer of Code, and Hacktoberfest.
Our deepest gratitude and appreciation go out to all Jenkins contributors and the open-source community beyond.

=== Pipeline Steps Reference

Thanks to the work of author:vihaanthora[Vihaan Thora], contributing via link:/blog/2022/10/10/pipeline-steps-improvement-gsoc-report/#project-specific-guidance[Google Summer of Code], the link:/doc/pipeline/steps/[Pipeline Steps] reference page has been improved.
The Pipeline Steps reference page is invaluable for developers when working in Jenkins and utilizing plugins.
The updates include search functionality, UI improvements, and a reduction in page load.

image:/images/post-images/2023/01/11/jenkins-newsletter/image5.png[image,width=624,height=388]

=== Algolia search

image:/images/post-images/2023/01/11/jenkins-newsletter/image6.png[image,width=275,height=52]

The Jenkins site search has been updated to use the latest version of https://www.algolia.com/[Algolia].
We want to recognize and thank author:halkeye[Gavin Mogan] for all of his work on this and Algolia for donating the search functionality.
The site search now provides more relevant results and suggestions for users.
A visual update was included as part of the upgrade, resulting in the new look and UI.

In 2022, the Jenkins project was able to collaborate on and complete several projects.
This included launching two new sites for community engagement and involvement:

* link:https://community.jenkins.io/[community.jenkins.io] now provides a space for community discourse and communication.
* link:https://stories.jenkins.io/[stories.jenkins.io] is a site dedicated to sharing the experiences and stories of Jenkins users, developers, and contributors that Jenkins has impacted.

Jenkins was also able to expand by adding new release leads.

* Newer members and contributors to Jenkins are taking on the role of release lead for our LTS releases.
** This creates an open opportunity to work directly with Jenkins developers and provides the community another avenue to engage and contribute to Jenkins.

Throughout the year, the Jenkins project participated in:

* link:/sigs/gsoc/[Google Summer of Code]
* link:/blog/2022/04/11/She-Code-Africa-contributhon/[She Code Africa]
* link:/events/hacktoberfest/[Hacktoberfest]
This participation allowed us to collaborate with new Jenkins users all over the globe, improve several areas of Jenkins, and celebrate the successes of the community!

The Jenkins project is also excited to share what's to come in 2023:

* Jenkins in GSoC 2023 : link:/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/[Call for Project Ideas] + link:/blog/2022/12/09/GSoC-the-gift-of-mentorship/[Call for Mentors].
** link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_sTkGtTix8[A Guide to Better Preparations] is a great resource for potential GSoC candidates, who want to get started and increase their chance of getting accepted into the program.
* https://fosdem.org/2023/[FOSDEM'23]: Jenkins will have a devstand at FOSDEM (Feb 4-5, 2023).
* https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/20x[SCALE 20X]: Jenkins will have a booth presence at SCALE (March 9-12, 2023).

Finally, we want to link:/blog/2022/11/24/jenkins-sponsor-appreciation/[thank our partners and sponsors] over the year, as so much of this is possible with the help of their contributions.
