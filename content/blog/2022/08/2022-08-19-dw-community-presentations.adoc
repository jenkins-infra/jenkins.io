Following Jenkins' recent move to Java 11 and significant security advisories for plugin users, the Jenkins community has the opportunity to come together to discuss Jenkins success stories, what's to come for Jenkins, and novel uses of the leading open source automation server.

With *30 sessions for Jenkins users and 100+ sessions total on software delivery best practices*, DevOps World has a lot to offer DevOps engineers, managers in shared services, and leaders alike.

Here's a quick look at six sessions our Jenkins teams are interested in:


*_Ask Me Anything About the Jenkins Infrastructure_*

Thursday, September 29 | 1:45 PM - 2:15 PM EDT

Members of the Jenkins Infrastructure team will answer any question you have about the infrastructure, its model, tools, or processes. 
Learn how this team handles daily updates of multiple Jenkins controllers and their plugins and more than 50 dependency updates per week. 
If you have any questions around security processes, infrastructure as code, onboarding, or tooling, the team will answer them.

*_How did we reduce 35% Jenkins failures at Broadcom_*

Wednesday, September 28 | 4:15 PM - 4:30 PM EDT

Learn how Broadcom's Centralized Tools team, supporting 600+ engineers with thousands of Jenkins jobs daily, used a data-led approach to accelerate CI/CD efforts and reduced CI/CD failure by 35 percent while reducing resources needed. 
Leave the session understanding the five-step process and tooling and types of analytics you need to replicate their success.

'''

*_Moving Jenkins to a New Frontier of Performance with Java 11_*

Thursday, September 29 | 2:45 PM - 3:30 PM EDT

In this session, you will learn about Jenkins' transition from Java 8 to Java 11, the performance benefits that come with and discuss performance tuning Jenkins for Java 11. 
We will also take a deep dive into how garbage collection works in Java 11 and share the results of our performance experiments based on the new ZGC and Shenandoah garbage collectors.

'''

*_Naively Building Android Apps with Jenkins. Not Natively, Naively._*

Wednesday, September 28 | 4:15 PM - 5:00 PM EDT

At the end of this session, you should be able to start CI/CD for Android app development at home with an unconventional method. 
Embark with Bruno on an adventure full of joys, frustrations, discoveries, but above all learning.

*_Jenkins Plugin Health Scoring System_*

Thursday, September 29 | 1:45 PM - 2:30 PM EDT

As a Jenkins administrator, or an engineer working in a shared service team, choosing which plugins of the 1800+ plugins to use in your controller is pretty difficult. 
Learn how the Plugin Health score - which reviews all plugins on different data points like security, stability, administrative metrics, code, and testing quality - can help you evaluate new plugins before installing them.

'''

*_Transformation of the Jenkins User Interface and Where it's Going Next_*

Thursday, September 29 | 10:45 AM - 11:30 AM EDT

Join this session for an overview of the Jenkins user interface covering its past, what it looks like currently, and where it is headed. 
Review the lessons learned as the Jenkins UI evolved and get a preview of the future state, including how plugin developers can integrate these changes using the new Jenkins Design Library. 

'''

And last but not least, one of my contributions to DevOps World…

*_Contributing to Open Source Workshops_*

Wednesday, September 28 | 10:45 AM - 12:15 PM EDT

Join this 90-minute pre-conference workshop for insight into how to create useful and positive contributions to an open source project and learn more about Jenkins plugins, Java, and GitHub. Participants will "learn by doing" as they confirm that their changes are useful, correct, and complete.
