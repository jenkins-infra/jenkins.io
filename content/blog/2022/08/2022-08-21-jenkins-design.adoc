\... at the _'Transformation of the Jenkins User Interface and Where itâ€™s Going Next'_ talk at DevOps World 2022.

We'll be giving a talk on the history of the Jenkins user interface, where we stand today, and a look into the future of where we plan to take Jenkins.

---

Expect to hear about the lessons we've learned and the challenges we're tackling as we update Jenkins for the modern web.

Our aims for the talk are to explain in detail our reasonings behind the changes

Plugin developers can integrate these changes using the new link:https://weekly.ci.jenkins.io/design-library[Jenkins Design Library].
