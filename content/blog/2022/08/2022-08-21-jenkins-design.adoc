\... at the _'Transformation of the Jenkins User Interface and Where itâ€™s Going Next'_ talk at DevOps World 2022.

We'll be giving a talk on the history of the Jenkins user interface, the interface as of today, and a look into the close to distant future of where we plan to take the interface.

We'll be exploring the lessons we've learned and the challenges we've tackled as we update Jenkins for the modern web.

as the Jenkins UI evolved and get a preview of the future state, including how plugin developers can integrate these changes using the new Jenkins Design Library.
