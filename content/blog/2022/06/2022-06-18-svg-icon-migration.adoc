  Starting with Jenkins 2.333, Jenkins core has migrated from `GIF` and `PNG` icons to `SVG` icons.

== Summary

Beginning with Jenkins v2.333 (released on June 15, 2022), Jenkins core has upgraded from `GIF` and `PNG` icons to `SVG` icons.
Plugins that will be affected by this change are tracked in a link:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PxlgT11_uDyTzPch8zWn3PDxLUIAab21ILmJ17zCzBk/edit#gid=1308179162[spreadsheet] found in link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-68251[JENKINS-68251].
Plugins that do not interact with icons are unaffected by this change.

== Background

Scalable vector graphics (SVG) icons provide a more attractive user interface.
They are able to adapt to themes like the link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/dark-theme/[dark theme] and the link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/solarized-theme/[solarized theme].
The SVG icons provide a more consistent experience for users.

SVG formatting also preserves the image quality during compression, ensuring that icons are displayed properly regardless of scale.
For tracking purposes, link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-68251)[JENKINS-68251] is available and contains a link to a link:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PxlgT11_uDyTzPch8zWn3PDxLUIAab21ILmJ17zCzBk/edit#gid=1308179162[tracking spreadsheet] listing plugins and their corresponding states to this update.

*Make sure that you have used the Plugin Manager to update all plugins before and after updating Jenkins as failing to do so may result in errors.*

== Reporting issues

In the spreadsheet, there is a table labeled “Abandoned plugin, to be discussed”.

image:/images/post-images/2022-06-svg-migration/abandoned-plugin.png[Abandoned plugin table label from spreadsheet.]

The table contains plugins that have had no SCM activity for at least 5 years.

When reviewing this table, if you locate any plugins that are currently in use, please reach out to the plugin maintainer to perform this maintenance.

If the maintainer has indeed abandoned the plugin, please consider link:/doc/developer/plugin-governance/adopt-a-plugin/[adopting the plugin] yourself.
After adoption, use the link:/doc/developer/views/icon-path-to-icon-class-migration/[icon path to icon class migration instructions] to update the plugin.

When link:/participate/report-issue/redirect/[reporting SVG icon migration issues], please provide the following information:

. Use the ‘svg-migration’ label
. Provide configuration details as described in link:/participate/report-issue/#Howtoreportanissue-Creatingtheissue["How to report an issue"], including Jenkins core version and the name and version of all installed plugins
. Include a screenshot of the issue

== Conclusion

While many of the commonly used plugins have already been updated for SVG icon usage, there are unmaintained plugins that could cause errors or breakages.
If you are in a situation where a plugin has been abandoned, adoption is the only way to ensure that there are no disruptions during usage.
