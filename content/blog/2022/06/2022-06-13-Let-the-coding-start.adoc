The GSoC "Bonding Period" just finished. 

The four Jenkins GSoC projects are now ready. 
Contact between Contributors and Mentors is established.
Regular communication channels are setup (weekly project meetings and dedicated chat).
Links to the project plans and plannings drafts are published on the link:https://jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/[project pages].

Next step, the actual coding! 

Together with their mentors, Dheeraj, Ymming, Hrushikesh, and Vihaan will work the whole summer on their respective projects.

End July, we will perform a public progress review. 
During an online meetup, the GSoC contributors will to present their project. 
They will be invited to share what has been done to date. 
And why not, make a first preliminary demo. 
Although very intimidating, this will be a unique opportunity for the Community to comment, advise and get involved with the project.
