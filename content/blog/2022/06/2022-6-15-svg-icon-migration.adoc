  Starting with Jenkins 2.333, Jenkins core has migrated from `GIF` and `PNG` icons to `SVG` icons.
---

== Summary

Beginning with Jenkins v2.333 (released on June 15, 2022), Jenkins core has upgraded from `GIF` and `PNG` icons to `SVG` icons.
Plugins that will be affected by this change are tracked in a link:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PxlgT11_uDyTzPch8zWn3PDxLUIAab21ILmJ17zCzBk/edit#gid=1308179162[spreadsheet] found in link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-68251[JENKINS-68251].
Plugins that do not interact with icons are unaffected by this change.

== Background

Updating the Jenkins icons to these previously uploaded SVG icons provides users with a more consistent experience.
SVG formatting also preserves the image quality during compression, ensuring that icons are displayed properly regardless of scale.
For tracking purposes, link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-68251)[JENKINS-68251] is available and contains a link to a link:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PxlgT11_uDyTzPch8zWn3PDxLUIAab21ILmJ17zCzBk/edit#gid=1308179162[spreadsheet] listing plugins and their corresponding states to this update.

*Make sure that you have used the Plugin Manager to update all plugins before and after updating Jenkins as failing to do so may result in errors.*

== Reporting issues

In the spreadsheet, there is a table labeled “Abandoned plugin, to be discussed”.

image:images/post-images/2022-06-svg-migration/abandoned-plugin.png[Abandoned plugin table label]

The table contains plugins that have not had any SCM activity for at least 5 years.

When reviewing this table, if you locate any plugins that are currently in use, please reach out to the plugin maintainer to perform this maintenance.

If the maintainer has indeed abandoned the plugin, link:/doc/developer/plugin-governance/adopt-a-plugin/[adopting the plugin] yourself would be the next best solution.
After adoption, use the instructions provided link:https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/views/icon-path-to-icon-class-migration/[here] to perform the update and make necessary changes to the plugin.

When reporting plugin updates, please use the following information:

. Use the ‘svg-migration’ label.
. Provide the full name of the plugin that is being updated.

== Conclusion

While many of the commonly used plugins have already been updated for SVG icon usage, there are unmaintained plugins that could cause errors or breakages.
If you are in a situation where a plugin has been abandoned, adoption is the only way to ensure that there are no disruptions during usage.
