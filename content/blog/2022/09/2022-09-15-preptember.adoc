Once again, link:https://hacktoberfest.com[Hacktoberfest] is back!
During this October event, everyone can celebrate and support open-source by contributing changes and can earn limited edition swag.

== Maintainers

Jenkins and plugin **maintainers** need also to get ready for Hacktoberfest by preparing your project for contributions by following these best practices:

* Add the "hacktoberfest" topic to your repository to OPT-IN TO HACKTOBERFEST and indicate you're looking for contributions
* Apply the "hacktoberfest" label to issues you want contributors to help with in your GitHub project
* Add a CONTRIBUTING.md file with contribution guidelines to your repository
* Choose issues that have a well-defined scope and are self-contained
* Adopt a code of conduct to create a greater sense of inclusion and community for contributors
* Be ready to review pull requests, accepting those that are valid by merging them, leaving an overall approving review, or by adding the "hacktoberfest-accepted" label
* Reject any spammy requests you receive by labeling them as "spam" and any other invalid contributions by closing them or labeling them as "invalid"
