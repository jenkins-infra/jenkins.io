Once again, link:https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com[Hacktoberfest] is back!
During this October event, everyone can celebrate and support open-source by contributing changes, and can earn limited edition swag.

September is the perfect time to prepare for Hacktoberfest. 
Get a jump start by finding projects to contribute to, adding "Hacktoberfest" tag to your projects, or familiarizing yourself with Git.

The Jenkins community will participate once again to the event. 
We invite you to contribute to Jenkins projects but also, as maintainers, to welcome and help newcomers.

This is what **contributors** need to know to participate and complete Hacktoberfest:

- Register anytime between September 26 and October 31
- Pull requests can be made in any jenkinsci or jenkins-infra Github project that's participating in Hacktoberfest (look for the “hacktoberfest” topic)
- Project maintainers must accept your pull requests for them to count toward your total
- Have 4 pull requests accepted between October 1 and October 31 to complete Hacktoberfest
- The first 40,000 participants (maintainers and contributors) who complete Hacktoberfest can elect to receive one of two prizes: a tree planted in their name, or the Hacktoberfest 2022 t-shirt.

Jenkins and plugin **maintainers** need also to get ready for Hacktoberfest by preparing your project for contributions by following these best practices:

* Add the “hacktoberfest” topic to your repository to OPT-IN TO HACKTOBERFEST and indicate you're looking for contributions.
* Apply the “hacktoberfest” label to issues you want contributors to help with in your GitHub project.
* Add a CONTRIBUTING.md file with contribution guidelines to your repository.
* Choose issues that have a well-defined scope and are self-contained.
* Adopt a code of conduct to create a greater sense of inclusion and community for contributors.
* Be ready to review pull requests, accepting those that are valid by merging them, leaving an overall approving review, or by adding the “hacktoberfest-accepted” label.
* Reject any spammy requests you receive by labeling them as “spam,” and any other invalid contributions by closing them or labeling them as “invalid.”
