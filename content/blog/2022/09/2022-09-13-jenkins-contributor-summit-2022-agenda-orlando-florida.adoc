=== Description

The Jenkins Contributor Summit brings together current and future contributors to the Jenkins project. At this event we will talk about the current state of the project and its future evolution.

The summit will include project updates by the Governance Board, working and special interest groups. We will also organize breakout sessions to discuss key initiatives in the project and its roadmap. Topics include but are not limited to: architecture changes, Jenkins Security, Cloud Native Jenkins, interoperability, documentation, and user experience.
