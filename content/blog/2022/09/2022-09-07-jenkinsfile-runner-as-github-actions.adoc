== Abstract

Jenkinsfile Runner Action for GitHub Actions aims at providing customized environments and useful GitHub Actions for the users.
Therefore, users can execute the Jenkins pipeline in the GitHub Actions runners.
It enables running Jenkins pipelines in a Function-as-a-Service context.
Users can customize their environment by setting up base images, configuring the Jenkins Configuration-as-Code plugin,
extending vanilla images or providing initial hooks for the temporary Jenkins controller.
Several examples about how to set up secrets, Jenkins plugins and integrate with other GitHub Actions can be seen below.
This project is based on the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkinsfile-runner/[Jenkinsfile runner], which is a command line tool for the Jenkins pipeline execution engine.

== Implementation

Jenkinsfile Runner Action for GitHub Actions help users fetch necessary dependencies,
and wrap the entrypoint for Jenkinsfile Runner in one GitHub Action.
Users can use them in the workflow definitions just like other GitHub Actions.
Based on this big idea, I developed five GitHub Actions.

=== Runtime type actions

These actions run the pipeline in the GitHub Actions runners host machines directly.

* `jfr-setup-action` - It's used to set up the Jenkins environment, including but not limited to Jenkins core, plugin installation manager and Jenkinsfile Runner.

* `jfr-plugin-installation-action` - Users can use it to install extra plugins. `jfr-setup-setup` needs to be run before.

* `jfr-runtime-action` - It runs the Jenkins pipeline in the host machine. `jfr-setup-setup` needs to be run before.

=== Container type actions

These actions run the pipeline in the customized container.

* `jfr-container-action` - It runs the Jenkins pipeline in the declared container.
As the prebuilt container is declared in advance, it can integrate with other GitHub Actions theoretically.
It's based on the idea of link:https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/running-jobs-in-a-container[Running jobs in a container].

* `jfr-static-image-action` - It runs the Jenkins pipeline in the runtime built container.
It doesn't need to declare the container in advance so users cannot use other GitHub Actions except using `actions/checkout` to set up the workspace.
But the users can override the base image by providing the docker image URL.
For instance, if users want to combine the Jenkins environment with nodejs environment, they can use `node:18.3.0` as input.
It's based on the idea of link:https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/creating-a-docker-container-action#introduction/[GitHub Docker container action].

== Phase 1

When I started to write code based on my previous proposal, I found my implementation is different from the expectation of the maintainer and the mentors.
What I wanted to do is make Jenkinsfile runner capable of generating necessary configurations for users.
So they can use these configuration files to complete their Jenkinsfile runner actions.
However, this method will couple the configuration generation step with Jenkinsfile runner which is a command line tool for Jenkins pipeline execution engine.
The maintainer and the mentors proposed to make several useful GitHub Actions instead of coupling this unnecessary logic into Jenkinsfile runner.
Therefore, I changed my project plan based on their advice and worked on developing the GitHub Actions for Jenkinsfile runner.

In this stage, I developed `jfr-container-action` and `jfr-static-image-action`, which run in the customized containers.
Its main advantage is that most dependencies are prepared in advance in the container.
I also made several useful options in Jenkinsfile runner available in our GitHub actions such as the initial hook option.
To make users get started in our actions quickly, I refactored the documentation several times,
and created several useful examples.
It is worth noting that my examples aim at applying Jenkins pipeline in GitHub Actions runner which is a FaaS context.

== Phase 2

In the second phase, I found current actions can only be supported by GitHub Actions Linux runner.
Then I decided to develop the runtime type actions so they can run in all kinds of GitHub Actions runners.
Its advantages are obvious.
The runtime type actions are `jfr-setup-action`, `jfr-plugin-installation-action` and `jfr-runtime-action`.
These actions will download all the dependencies at the runtime compared to container type actions' behavior.
Its main disadvantage is the possibility of suffering from a download center outage.

What's more, I kept developing examples for the actions and updated the documentation.
As the project and documentation grow infinitely, I decided to split my project into several subprojects,
and host the documentation including the user guide and developer guide on the GitHub Pages.

== Deliverables

I write a link:https://jenkinsci.github.io/jfr-action-doc[central documentation page] above the interface, basic usage, advanced usage, demos and developer guide for these Jenkinsfile-runner GitHub actions.
If you feel confused about the definitions or examples, you can check the documentation page mentioned above.

=== How to use jfr-container-action

The user needs to declare the image usage of `ghcr.io/jenkinsci/jenkinsfile-runner:master` at the start of the job.
Then the user can call this action by using `jenkinsci/jfr-container-action@master`.
Because the runner declares the container environment at the start, 
other GitHub Actions can also run with `jfr-container-action` theoretically.

=== How to use jfr-static-image-action

`jfr-static-image-action` can also run the pipeline in the container.
But the users don't need to declare the container by themselves like `jfr-container-action`.
Instead, `jfr-static-image-action` wraps the preparation and invocation of a customized container.
Therefore, the users cannot use other GitHub Actions except using `actions/checkout` to set up the workspace. 
The users can call this action by using `jenkinsci/jfr-static-image-action@master`.

=== How to use jfr-runtime-action with other supporting runtime type actions

`jfr-runtime-action` will run the pipeline in the host machine directly.
The users need to use `jfr-setup-action` in advance.
If the users want to install extra plugins, they can use `jfr-plugin-installation-action`.
The advantage of `jfr-runtime-action` is that it can run in all kinds of runners provided by GitHub Actions.

== Reflection

The most valuable lesson I learned in GSoC is not about how to write code.
It's about the method of communicating with other people in the Jenkins community.
When I was new in the Jenkins community, I kept making assumptions when I communicate with my mentors and project maintainers.
Therefore, it's easy for them to misunderstand my idea.
The best way of communication in Jenkins open source community is over-explanation.
Sometimes, people who lack background information cannot understand your ideas about a specific topic.
Therefore, providing some extra explanations or descriptions is necessary.

The second lesson I learned is still about communication.
When you feel confused about the words under a specific context, it's better to ask the contributors or your mentors directly instead of spending plenty of time by yourself.
The people in Jenkins open source community are always willing to give you the answers.
Furthermore, if you have obstacles or milestones when developing the tools or plugins, it's still necessary to ask the community developers first instead of making the decisions arbitrarily.
