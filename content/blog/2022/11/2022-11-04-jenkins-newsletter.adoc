Happy reading!

== Security Update

* One security advisory during October about plugins
** 28 impacted plugins
** 8 without fixes, as explained in our process
** 4 plugins were suspended from distribution
** Due to the corrections applied for SECURITY-2824 in the Groovy sandbox, we strongly recommend you to update as soon as possible.
* We got several questions / reports related to Text4Shell (https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-42889[CVE-2022-42889])
** The Security team did an investigation and nothing in the Jenkins ecosystem is affected.
** Due to the https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-text/security.html[communication from Apache] about why it's not a vulnerability like Log4Shell&#44; we do not plan to publish a blog post about our analysis.


== Infrastructure Update 

* Hacktoberfest support: ~15% more builds for a cost decrease of $2.000!
* Fall cleanup of accounts.jenkins.io and wiki.jenkins.io (Unified designs, dependencies updates, bug fixes)
* Upgrade of our controllers to the new LTS 2.361.2
* Upgrade of Kubernetes to 1.23.x for the 6 clusters (Amazon, Digital Ocean and Azure)
* Request for volunteers to host download mirrors in India
* Security Advisories support (Jenkins Infrastructure is the first user!)


== Platform Update

* Very last JDK8 https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-inbound-agent/pull/292[docker images] have been released
* https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-ssh-agent/pull/165[Preparation] of the three agents repos merging while solving a https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-ssh-agent/issues/131[bug].
* Loss of the ppc64le loaner machine from IBM, some reference https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/3198[cleaning] to do.
* JDK17 aarch64 docker image bug https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-agent/issues/308[discovered] and https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker-agent/pull/309[solved].
* First https://riscv.org/[RISC-V] https://mangopi.org/mqpro[machine] received, tests should happen in the coming months
* JVM stats for October: Java 8 fell from 153,205 to 139,827; Java 11 rose from 137,332 to 141,387; and Java 17 rose from 11,173 to 14,420. There are now more users on Java 11 than Java 8.

== User Experience Update

The http://accounts.jenkins.io[accounts.jenkins.io] page has been significantly updated thanks to the work of Tim Jacomb, Alexander Brandes, and Gavin Mogan.

At a high level, Tim and Alex made major dependency updates.
Tim was also able to update the UI to be more modern and synchronize with the link:/[jenkins.io] interface.
Gavin was able to create and add the page header & footer, so that page transitions are seamless.
This work to keep Jenkins aligned and up to date is greatly appreciated, and necessary to keep it modern.

The http://wiki.jenkins.io[old Jenkins wiki] site has also received a face lift, as it has been updated with the stylesheets used for the accounts page update.
Despite the wiki being deprecated, finding and reading information on the site is much easier.
This is yet another way to make the page transitions more seamless throughout Jenkins.
