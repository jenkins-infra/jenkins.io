As November continues, we want to share some highlights from Hacktoberfest 2022!
This year's edition was incredibly busy with lots of interesting ideas, great work, new Jenkins contributors, and returning contributors. 
We want to thank all of the contributors and mentors for all of their hard work, as none of this would be possible without them.

link:https://hacktoberfest.com/[Hacktoberfest] is an event to highlight and celebrate open-source projects like Jenkins.
The main idea of the event is contributing to and improving open-source software.
People are invited to submit pull requests to contribute to plugins, provide documentation, create translations, and review code among other things, to engage with open-source software. 
Many products and services are based on open-source software, so giving back in this way continues the cycle of development.

For link:https://www.jenkins.io/events/hacktoberfest/faq/[Jenkins], Hacktoberfest is an opportunity to collaborate with and expand the community, while learning and sharing with all experience levels.
These contributions are what keeps Jenkins moving forward, so having an opportunity to celebrate both the project and the people is amazing.

== Hacktoberfest results

During October, the Jenkins project received over 613 pull requests from 117 different contributors.
All of these helped to improve Jenkins, create new resources, and review the needs of Jenkins accordingly.
From these, 531 pull requests are completed, meaning they have been merged or flagged as "hacktoberfest-approved".
They were submitted by 95 different contributors, with 42 qualifying for link:https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/#contributors[swag] with Jenkins contributions alone!
A total of 1,183 manually created pull requests were submitted during October in the jenkins-ci and jenkins-infra organizations.
Overall, this appears to be a 10 to 15 percent increase in the average number of monthly submissions.
With all of this in mind, we want to highlight some of the new and returning Jenkins contributors, including their experiences and advice for other users.

== New Jenkins contributors

First, we'd like to share some insight from link:https://github.com/Jagrutiti[Jagruti Tiwari]. 
Jagruti is Based in Mumbai, India and active in various areas of open source.
This immersion is the main component of their strategy to explore and learn new things.
They are not afraid of challenges and have received assistance from the friendly, open-source communities. 
They are inspired by thought leaders such as Ankita Tripathi.
Jagruti's contributions to Jenkins during Hacktoberfest includes documentation, code examples, and testing.
They have also provided reviews for other community members, which supports the open-source spirit.

We also want to welcome link:https://github.com/highflyer910[Thea Mushambadze].
Thea created three new logos: link:https://www.jenkins.io/artwork/#turkey[Turkey], link:https://www.jenkins.io/artwork/#georgia[Georgia], and a link:https://www.jenkins.io/artwork/#nerd[Jenkins nerd] themed logo.
These logos help connect Jenkins to users globally and extend the community even further.
Thea is a freelance developer, and this is their first time contributing to Jenkins in Hacktoberfest.
Their motivation when starting was curiosity and learning more about open source.
Through their contributions, they have learned how to work with someone else's code.
There have been challenges when new tools are installed, but don't work as expected.
However, these are learning experiences, as each one is an opportunity to understand what is causing the behavior.

Next, we want to introduce link:https://github.com/OmkarBorhade98[Omkar Borhade] from Pune, India.
Omkar just started as a software engineer, after graduating as a Mechanical Engineer.
They are new to open source, and this was their first time participating in Hacktoberfest.
Their goal was to become more familiar the Jenkins project.
This was acheived by a lot of reading, approaching issues with an open mind, and providing documentation.
As a new contributor, they shared it can be difficult to understand the issue and what is needed for resolution.
This knowledge comes with experience, so have some patience when getting started.

link:https://github.com/krisstern[Kris Stern] is a full-stack software engineer based out of Hong Kong SAR, China.
They have previously trained as an observational astrophysicist with a PhD in physics, and is currently studying part-time for a computer science master's degree. 
This is their third Hacktoberfest, and first Hacktoberfest contributing to Jenkins.
They have contributed to open source previously for astronomy, but shifted focus since graduating.
Their goals during Hacktoberfest were giving back to the Jenkins community and acquiring more software development skills along the way.



== Returning Jenkins contributors

First, we want to welcome back link:https://github.com/jimklimov[Jim Klimov].
Jim is based in the Czech Republic, and has been working in open source for quite some time.
They have worked on various enterprise document workflow and messaging systems, and is currently a DevOps architect.
They are the creator and maintainer of several Jenkins plugins.
Along with their own experience, they learned a lot from the people that came before.
Having this knowledge feels like standing on the shoulders of giants.
This is their second Hacktoberfest in Jenkins, but contributes all year round.
Challenges that have come up for Jim include maintainability expectations to get pull requests merged, and architecture becoming more costly as time goes on.

// need to get profile
//Stefan from Aachen (western border of Germany)
//Stefan has been participating in Hacktoberfest since 2019.
//They have a strong focus on Jenkins core and plugin development.
//This is something that Stefan likes to contribute to in their free time.
//Hacktoberfest was the trigger to start participating, and has found several areas to contribute to.
//These include projects that still have spotbugs disabled and adopting a plugin in anticipation of Hacktoberfest.
//Open-source software is used daily, especially in professional life.
//Stefan embraces this by giving back as an OSS consumer.
//Some of the challenges faced as a contributer are setting up the environment and meeting approval expectations of a maintainer.

//not sure of name/account
//Kayla from Minnesota has been participating in Hacktoberfest since 2018.
//Was low on time. Encouraged people in his company to join. And then jumped in: "I have to do it, no matter how busy I am"
//Hacktoberfest is an excuse to make time and get others to join in.
//"Open source is mission critical for my own (fun) projects and the things we build at [my company]". "OSS helps us build better software and never get stuck"
//"I ended up contributing to Jenkins because Jenkins is how we deliver product code". Using CloudBees Enterprise products but under the hood a big part is Jenkins.
//Recommendation: find a repo with clear steps (as with most Jenkins repos) => CONTRIBUTING.md, a good chat or where maintainers offer help.
//Fixing a small bug that affects you is also great because you know the issue.

== Contributor insights

The thrill you get from knowing that countless people are using something you built is something a swag can never match.

If an issue is too hard to solve at the moment, take a break from it and try out a different one.

[quote,Omkar Borhade]
____
Contributing to open source also gives a feeling of satisfaction that the projects you are contributing to are used by several people on this planet and your contributions are benefiting them in one way or another.

When you are new, it does feel scary and confusing. 
Patience is important in the beginning.
Don't be afraid to ask your doubts.

Since, my all contributions for this Hacktoberfest were to Jenkins project, I would like to thank Jenkins and team to accepts my commits, guiding me in the resolution of issues and helping me to learn and grow by the means of the project.

[quote,Thea Mushambadze]
For people hesitating, there is nothing to fear.
Start with the easiest issues, and step after step it gets more fun.
You will notice how you grow as a developer.

[quote,Kris Stern]
____ 
I think open source is important because besides its utility it is also a great way to organize knowledge and to build communities with a common set of interests or purposes. 

Sometimes engaging in open source means tinkering with new tech and going at it alone. It is challenging at times but also tremendously rewarding. 

Sometimes it is hard to get started, and it takes time and perseverance to make things work the way they are intended.

[quote, Jim Klimov]
____
Find a project that interests you, with technologies or approaches you want to learn, go tinker, and post PRs.

In any case, you would learn more about the world, project, yourself, interactions and patience.

Documentation is one area almost everyone can do better, and almost anyone can help improve. It is easy to overlook something as "apparent" after a decade of experience with a project when it is really non-trivial for a newcomer.

In case of Jenkins core, plugin or shared library contributions, keep in mind that Java IDEs like NetBeans or IDEA can be very helpful to step through the server sources with a debugger. Peppering code with temporary `printlns` only goes so far, sometimes you will need real tools.

//"The first contribution is always the hardest. "
//To those that hesitate: "I encourage everyone to try it out. We have within Jenkins a great community which tries to help so that the PR also gets merged eventually."
