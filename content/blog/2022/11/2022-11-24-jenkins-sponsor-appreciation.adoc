The Jenkins project would like to take a moment and share deep gratitude to our sponsors.
Sponsorship of the Jenkins project is key to the maintenance and development of Jenkins.
There are different ways in which our sponsor organizations support the Jenkins project, such as infrastructure, necessary development tools, funding, and providing mirrors to connect Jenkins to the community.
 
For supporting Jenkins distribution, build, test, and deployment infrastructure, we would like to thank link:https://jfrog.com/[JFrog], https://aws.amazon.com/[AWS], link:https://www.oracle.com/[Oracle], link:https://www.digitalocean.com/[Digital Ocean], and link:https://osuosl.org/[OSU Open Source Labs].

Massive thanks to link:https://www.algolia.com/[Algolia] for providing site search for the primary Jenkins documentation and plugins sites.

We also want to share deep gratitude for operational funding from link:https://cd.foundation/[CD Foundation], link:https://www.cloudbees.com/[CloudBees], and link:https://aws.amazon.com/[AWS].
Without funding, the community would have less opportunities to work on and develop Jenkins.
