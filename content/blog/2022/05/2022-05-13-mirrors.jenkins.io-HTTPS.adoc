  The 19th of May 2022, the domain `mirrors.jenkins.io` will be forced to HTTPS and consolidated into the same system as `get.jenkins.io`.

The Jenkins project provides a download mirror infrastructure allowing to download Jenkins packages and plugins from a download server close to your location.

== How Does it Work?

When a download request is emitted to either `mirrors.jenkins.io` or `get.jenkins.io`, an HTTP redirect response to a mirror download server is answered.

The Jenkins infrastructure uses a database of existing mirror servers provided by volunteers and donators to select the closest mirror to your location:
this is currently the role of the distinct `mirrors.jenkins.io` and `get.jenkins.io` services.

== Consolidation

The system behind `mirrors.jenkins.io` is using a software named link:https://mirrorbrain.org/["mirrorbrain"] and was originally used by the Jenkins infrastructure to provide download redirections to mirrors.

A new system was introduced in 2020: `get.jenkins.io`, using link:https://github.com/etix/mirrorbits["mirrorbits"] which is a great fit for a Kubernetes environment (lightweight, horizontally scalable) and provides a set of nice WebUI features to see the mirror list and grading.

INFO: Try it by yourself, check the mirrors providing the latest Jenkins LTS distribution: https://get.jenkins.io/war-stable/2.332.3/jenkins.war?mirrorlist[]

It's been 2 years and the new system is clearly the most reliable: that's why we, the Jenkins Infrastructure team, want to retire the "mirrorbrain" system.

In consequence, the 19th of May 2022, the domain name `mirrors.jenkins.io` will be changed to point to the actual "mirrorbits" system already available at `get.jenkins.io`.

This consolidation ensures all users downloading a Jenkins package or a plugin will use the closest download mirror to their location, without having to maintain 2 distinct systems.

== Enforced HTTPS

The main consequence is that the HTTPS protocol will be enforced for the request to the domain `mirrors.jenkins.io`.

The "mirrorbrain" system currently serving requests behind the domain `mirrors.jenkins.io` is not available through HTTPS, which is a safety issue for users downloading files.

The 19th of May 2022, that won't be the case anymore: like `get.jenkins.io`, HTTPS will be available and enforced for the requests going through the domain `mirrors.jenkins.io`.

== What Does It Change for Me?

- Short answer: nothing. You should already be using the domain `get.jenkins.io` as it's been the default since almost 2 years, and the content served by both system is the same.

- Long answer: if you are still using the former `mirrors.jenkins.io` and are not able to switch to `get.jenkins.io`, you'll see the following changes:
  - üåç The mirror usually selected might change as the grading system on mirrorbits is different (and covers way more mirrors): faster downloads for you!
  - üîê Your HTTP requests will be redirected to their corresponding URL using the HTTPS protocol with a valid TLS certificate signed by the Let's Encrypt authority: improved safety!
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è The IP pointed by the DNS record `mirrors.jenkins.io` will change from `52.202.51.185` to `52.167.253.43`: upgrade your proxies!
