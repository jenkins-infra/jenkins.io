The link:https://sites.google.com/shecodeafrica.org/contributhon[She Code Africa Contributhon] started April 5, 2022.
The link:https://sites.google.com/shecodeafrica.org/contributhon[She Code Africa Contributhon] is a boot camp where African women are paid to work with open source organizations on selected projects with dedicated mentors.
This program aims to create a more diverse, inclusive, and innovative culture within the African open source ecosystem by matching African women in technology with sponsor and mentor open source organizations.
The 7 mentees joining the Jenkins project come from Nigeria, Kenya, and Ghana.

The Jenkins project has been accepted as a link:https://sites.google.com/shecodeafrica.org/contributhon/mentor-orgs/current-mentoring-organizations[Contributhon mentoring organization].
We're spreading the project work between three different project ideas and are being helped by a She Code Africa project manager.
The projects include:

* link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b7UpZe314bkamUKJQuewiXtfCxRbX8BLBswX59G6Ykc/edit?usp=sharing[Inclusive naming improvements]
* link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AG437RU_ZLuhfbJJNj3ZSXllrFg_bYbru5x0rPq_u2c/edit?usp=sharing[Pipeline help improvements]
* link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AvONLtoFv_RIk-WTMzF8QodL9kbrOg0bI-5cb-pOGus/edit?usp=sharing[Screenshot updates]

We're in the community bonding phase, using the link:https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cd4Dlt1pvhyfJa0xrB0mBfg5dMzHBUbC/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116306159720926274068&rtpof=true&sd=true[Contributhon Onboarding Guide] to prepare for the projects.

We'd like to introduce our mentees so that you recognize them and can welcome them during code review and online chat.
