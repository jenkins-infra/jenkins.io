== Maintenance with downtime of JFrog Artifactory (repo.jenkins-ci.org) December 18, 2022

image::/images/sponsors/jfrog.png[JFrog, width=20%, align=center, link="https://jfrog.com/"]

December 18, 2022: our sponsor link:https://jfrog.com/[JFrog] will proceed to perform maintenance of our "jenkinsci" Artifactory instance.

Expect a complete downtime of about 6 hours due to the nature of this maintenance.
The maintenance involves cloud migration from Google Cloud to Amazon Web Services.

== Impacts

Only Jenkins contributors will be impacted, as no releases or builds on ci.jenkins.io or on developer machines will succeed during the downtime.
Jenkins users won't be impacted, as plugin downloads, update center, and websites such as link:/[jenkins.io] and https://plugins.jenkins.io will continue working as expected.

We'll update the link:https://status.jenkins.io[Jenkins Infrastructure Status Page] with the exact downtime window.

== Artifactory Service repo.jenkins-ci.org: a backbone of the Jenkins project

Despite not being directly used by the usual Jenkins users, the link:https://repo.jenkins-ci.org[repo.jenkins-ci.org] service is crucial for any contributor to the Jenkins project as it hosts all the development dependencies and released binaries as the source of truth.

The entire Jenkins Infrastructure uses this repository to build and publish Jenkins itself, and also all of its plugins and side projects.

It's also heavily used by the link:/security/team/[Jenkins Security Team] as part of their advisory publication.

This migration is an important requirement to ensure that JFrog is able to monitor the service and provide the best availability and infrastructure health.
