== Maintenance with downtime of JFrog Artifactory (repo.jenkins-ci.org) December 18, 2022

image::/images/sponsors/jfrog.png[JFrog, width=20%, align=center, link="https://jfrog.com/"]

December 18, 2022: our sponsor link:https://jfrog.com/[JFrog] will proceed to the maintenance of our "jenkinsci" Artifactory instance.

Expect an absolute downtime of about 6 hours due to the nature of this maintenance: a cloud migration from Google Cloud to Amazon Web Services.

Jenkins users should not be impacted: only Jenkins developers and contributors will be.

This migration is a strong requirement to ensure that JFrog is able to monitor the service and provide the best availability and infrastructure health.

We'll update the link:https://status.jenkins.io[Jenkins Infrastructure Status Page] with the exact downtime window.

== Artifactory Service repo.jenkins-ci.org: a backbone of the Jenkins project

Despite not being directly used by the usual Jenkins users (link:https://www.jenkins.io/download/mirrors/[Jenkins Download Mirrors are used across the world]),
the https://repo.jenkins-ci.org service is central for any contributor to the Jenkins project: it hosts all the development dependencies and released binaries as the source of truth.

The whole Jenkins Infrastructure uses this repository to build and publish Jenkins itself, but also all of its plugins and side projects.

It's also heavily used by the link:https://www.jenkins.io/security/team/[Jenkins Security Team] as part of their advisory publication.
