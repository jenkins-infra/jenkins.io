== Maintenance with downtime of JFrog Artifactory (repo.jenkins-ci.org) 18 of December of 2022

image::/images/sponsors/jfrog.png[JFrog, width=20%, align=center, link="https://jfrog.com/"]

18 December of 2022: our sponsor link:https://jfrog.com/[JFrog] will proceed to a maintenance of our the "jenkinsci" Artifactory instance.

Expect an absolute downtime of ~6 hours during due to the nature of this maintenance: a cloud migration from Google Cloud to Amazon Web Services.

Jenkins users should be impacted: only Jenkins developers and contributors will be.

This migration is a strong requirement to ensure that JFrog is able to monitor the service and to provide the best availability and infrastructure health.

We'll update the link:https://status.jenkins.io[Jenkins Infrastructure Status Page] with the exact downtime window.

== Artifactory Service repo.jenkins-ci.org: a backbone of the Jenkins project

Despite not being directly used by the usual Jenkins users (link:https://www.jenkins.io/download/mirrors/[Jenkins Download Mirrors are used across the world]),
the service https://repo.jenkins-ci.org is central for any contributor of the Jenkins project: it hosts all the development dependencies and released binaries as source of truth.

The whole Jenkins Infrastructure uses this repository to build and publish Jenkins itself, but also all of its plugins and side projects.

It's also heavily used by the link:https://www.jenkins.io/security/team/[Jenkins Security Team] as part of their advisory publication.
