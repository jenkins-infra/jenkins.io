'Tis the season of gift giving and what better way than to give the gift of mentorship.

Jenkins is a big supporter and contributor of programs like link:https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/[Google Summer of Code] (GSoC), She Code Africa, and Outreachy. 
We believe in the value and advancements in helping new, and in many cases under-represented contributors to the open source. 
There is also a special 'je ne sais quoi' that comes with giving your time and sharing your knowledge.  

This season of giving, we have opportunities for you to give the gift of mentorship. 
The Jenkins in Google Summer of Code welcome any Jenkins user interested in making a lifelong impact to contributors new to the open source. 

## What does mentorship require?
You know enough about the Jenkins code to guide the GSoC contributor on coding.

## As a mentor, you will:
- Spend 5-8 hours per week, for 10-22 weeks depending on the size of the project.
- Provide Jenkins specific code reviews on pull-requests.
- Review new contributors' proposals, presentations.
- Complete two (2) evaluation documents from Google.
- Not work alone, we make sure that every project has at least two mentors.

## What will you work on?
- You may choose to be a mentor/co-mentor for any of the link:https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/2023/project-ideas/[listed project ideas]. 
  Please note, this list is still evolving.
- Or link:https://www.jenkins.io/projects/gsoc/proposing-project-ideas/[propose] a project that is near and dear to your heart.
