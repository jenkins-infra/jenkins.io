== Governance Update

Contributed by: https://github.com/MarkEWaite[Mark Waite]

The 2022 Jenkins elections are complete.
Thanks to Kevin Martens for the link:/blog/2022/11/17/jenkins-election-candidates-and-results/[blog post] announcing the results of the election and thanks to Damien Duportal for running the election process.
We are glad to have received 65 registrations to vote in the election.
That is less than the 81 registered voters we had in 2021.

Elected officers and members of the Jenkins governance board will begin their service December 3, 2022.
Special thanks to the members of the governance board that have completed their two-year service:

== Security Update

Contributed by: https://github.com/Wadeck[Wadeck Follonier]

* One security advisory during November about plugins
** Usually the vulnerabilities in third party dependencies are not impacting the final product, it is worth mentioning when there is a true
positive case.
Pipeline Utility Steps Plugin was impacted by https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-configuration/security.html#CVE-2022-33980_prior_to_2.8.0.2C_RCE_when_applied_to_untrusted_input[CVE-2022-33980], leading to a remote code execution in Jenkins.


== Infrastructure Update

== User Experience Update 

Contributed by: https://github.com/MarkEWaite[Mark Waite]

Jenkins 2.375.1 was released on November 30, 2022 with more improvements to the user interface.
Special thanks to Jan Faracik, Tim Jacomb, Alexander Brandes, Wadeck Follonier, Daniel Beck, and many others that were involved in the most recent improvements to the user experience.

The weather icons have been updated to be more recognizable. They continue to work well in both light themes and dark themes.

The plugin manager navigation has moved from the top of the page to the side panel. The search field is more visible.

The User Experience SIG is also pleased to note a valuable improvement in the link:/changelog/#v2.380[Jenkins 2.380 weekly release].
The tooltips that were previously provided by the unmaintained and long outdated YahooUI JavaScript library are now being provided by the Tippy.js JavaScript framework.
Special thanks to Jan Faracik for his work removing that use of the YahooUI JavaScript library.

== Documentation Update 

Contributed by: https://github.com/kmartens27[Kevin Martens]

Jenkins.io is now using Algolia v3 for its search feature.
This update has not only improved searching on the Jenkins site, but also provided a new search UI, which provides helpful suggestions.
Massive thanks to Gavin Mogan for working on this and improving the Jenkins.io search.

> Algolia has graciously upgraded our search from their legacy v2 to the super pretty and useful v3 apis.
This includes a new fully accessible popup. I just love being able to goto jenkins.io and hitting ctrl+k to
search.

== Advocacy & Outreach Update

Contributed by: https://github.com/alyssat[Alyssa Tong]

Jenkins gets ready for Google Summer of Code 2023!

Google recently announced the GSoC https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline[2023 program timeline], and the Advocacy & Outreach SIG has responded!
We've established the link:/blog/2022/11/23/get-prepared-for-gsoc/[GSoC early preparations for applicants - steps to effective submission] post to help future contributors with the process.
On December 20, 2022 at 4PM UTC there will be a walk through of this process via a webinar.
We would like this to be an interactive webinar so bring your questions.
See link:/events/[Event Calendar] (See GSoC 2023 - Contributor webinar: How to get ready) for login details.

We are still in great need of link:/blog/2022/11/16/gsoc-2023/[project idea proposals and mentors].

* GSoC project ideas are coding projects that potential GSoC contributors can accomplish in 10-22 weeks.
* The coding projects can be new features, plugins, test frameworks, infrastructure, etc. Anyone can submit a project idea.
* Mentoring takes about 5 to 8 hours of work per week (more at the start, less at the end).
* Mentors provide guidance, coaching, and sometimes a bit of cheerleading. They review GSoC contributor proposals, pull requests and contributor presentations at the evaluation phase.
