A remote code execution vulnerability has been identified in the Spring Framework.

This vulnerability is identified as link:https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2022-22965[CVE-2022-22965].

Spring officially reacted early in link:https://spring.io/blog/2022/03/31/spring-framework-rce-early-announcement[an early announcement].

## SpringShell in Jenkins Core and Plugins

The Jenkins security team has confirmed that the Spring vulnerability is not affecting Jenkins Core.
There is no impact because we are using link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/stapler[Stapler] as a servlet, and neither Spring MVC nor Spring WebFlux.

An analysis was done on the plugins to determine whether some were using Spring in a dangerous way. No impact was found.

[NOTE]
====
The dangerous library is included as a dependency of link:https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.springframework.security/spring-security-web[spring-security-web], which is not yet updated to include the fixed version.

The presence of Spring Framework is not enough to make the application vulnerable.
====

## SpringShell in the Jenkins Infrastructure

The Jenkins infrastructure and security teams have confirmed that the Spring vulnerability is not affecting any part of the Jenkins infrastructure.

The following applications are Java applications that mention Spring as a dependency:

* The web service link:https://customize.jenkins.io/[customize.jenkins.io] was stopped out of an abundance of caution.

* The API of the web service link:https://plugins.jenkins.io[plugins.jenkins.io] is not affected,
as it runs with JDK 8 and only GlassFish servlets.

* The web service link:https://accounts.jenkins.io[accounts.jenkins.io] is not affected,
as it also runs with the JDK 8 and uses link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/stapler[Stapler] as a servlet.

[NOTE]
====
We may decide to disable some services if we discover other vulnerabilities.
You can see the status of services on link:https://status.jenkins.io/[the status page at status.jenkins.io].

## Further Updates

We may update this blog post, if there are any corrections to be made, and in that case weâ€™ll clearly call those out at the top.
