We are thrilled to announce that Jenkins has been accepted to 
link:https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/[Google Summer of Code 2022]! 
This will be Jenkins' sixth year as a mentoring organization. 

Congratulations to all link:https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/organizations[203 accepted open source participating organizations]!

For the past 5 years as a mentoring organization, 
Jenkins boasts mentorship of 27 GSoC students by 80+ mentors, 
that's bringing together over 107 strangers for a common idea - Jenkins. 

At the heart of it, GSoC is more than just a mentoring program, bridging new contributors to the open source. 
It is about giving a little of your day to make a lifetime of a difference, 
not only for the GSoC contributors but also for the many Jenkins users who will benefit from the improvements.  

We are excited to welcome new GSoC contributors to the Jenkins family. 
We think you will enjoy this valuable experience while developing your technical skills. 
You will gain insights into how the community works. 
The best part will be learning from people who are passionate about Jenkins 
but more importantly they passionate about wanting to make a difference for another individual (GSoC contributors) and for the betterment of the project as a whole.

For detailed information on Jenkins GSoC 2021, see link:/projects/gsoc/2021/[completed projects].


**What's next?**
GSoC is link:https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022[officially announced], and please expect more potential GSoC contributors to contact projects in our
link:/projects/gsoc#contacts[Gitter channels and Discourse channels].
Many communications will also happen in SIG and sub-project channels.
We will be working hard in order to help potential participants to find interesting projects, to explore the area,
and to prepare their project proposals before the deadline on April 19th.
Then we will process the applications, select projects and assign mentor teams.

All information about the Jenkins GSoC is available on its link:/projects/gsoc/[sub-project page].

== How do I apply?

See the link:/projects/gsoc/contributors[Information for students] page for full application guidelines.

We encourage interested participants to reach out to the Jenkins community early and to start exploring project ideas.
We also encourage participants to join the weekly link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OpvMWpzBKtKnYBAkhtQ1dK5zQix3D7RY5g3vDJXkSnc/edit?usp=sharing[Jenkins GSoC office hours], these meetings are set up for participants to meet org admins and mentors and to ask questions.
Also, join our link:https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#jenkinsci_gsoc-sig:gitter.im[Gitter channel] and our
link:https://community.jenkins.io/c/contributing/gsoc/6[Discourse server] 
to receive information about such incoming events in the project.

The application period starts on April 4th, but you should prepare now!
Use the time before the application period to discuss and improve your project proposals.
We also recommend that you become familiar with Jenkins and start exploring your proposal areas.
Project ideas include quick-start guidelines and reference newbie-friendly issues
which may help with initial study.
If you do not see anything interesting,
you can link:/projects/gsoc/proposing-project-ideas/[propose your own project idea].

== I want to be a mentor. Is it too late?

It's not!
We are looking for more project ideas and for Jenkins contributors/users
who are passionate about Jenkins and want to be a mentor.
No hardcore experience required, mentors can study the project internals together with GSoC contributors and technical advisors.

You can either propose a new project idea or join an existing one.
See the link:/blog/2022/01/07/gsoc-2022/[Call for Mentors post]
and link:/projects/gsoc/mentors[Information for mentors] for details.
If you want to propose a new project,
please do so as soon as possible so that potential GSoC contributors have time to explore them and to prepare their proposals.

This year mentorship does **NOT** require strong expertise in Jenkins development.
The objective is to guide participants and to get involved into the Jenkins community.
GSoC org admins will help to find advisers if special expertise is required.
