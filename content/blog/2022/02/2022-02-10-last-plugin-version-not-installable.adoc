I regularly go, as all Jenkins admin do, to my system's Plugin Management page to see what plugins can be upgraded.

Although I am running the latest LTS version, **I can't update some key plugins** (example the Junit plugin).
This is even more intriguing as some are part the recommended plugins (default plugin choice).
No "install" tick box and the plugin is labeled "unavailable".
There is a note saying "_This version of the plugin exists but it is not being offered for installation, so the latest bug fixes or features are not available to you. This is typically the case when plugin requirements, e.g. a recent version of Jenkins, are not satisfied. If you are using the latest version of Jenkins offered to you, newer plugin releases may not be available to your release line yet. See the plugin documentation for information about its requirements._".

The message indicates to Jenkins Administrators that a newer plugin version is available 
but that the installed Jenkins Core doesn't provide the necessary pre-requisite.

**Why is this happening now?**
Did I miss something?

As part of the continuous improvement of Jenkins, some critical and high impact changes are introduced.
This is typically the case of GUI changes (icons, fonts, layout) as is currently happening.
It is also the case for new core features that can be consumed by plugins.

Such changes are typically first introduced in the cutting edge Jenkins "weekly release".
Plugins are adapted to take advantage of these changes.
The minimal Jenkins release requirement for those new plugin version is set to the "cutting-edge" release to prevent incompatibility.
This causes a clear requirement disruption compared to the generally slow and shallow plugin requirement evolution.

It will require some field-testing time before these major changes will make it into the LTS Jenkins version.
In the mean time, the new plugin will have to wait before it can be installed on that release line.

If you _need_ to install that latest plugin version because it fixes also that annoying bug, you will have to evaluate whether it is worth switching to the weekly release line.

Note that this story is a strong reminder to keep your Jenkins system as current as possible if you don't want to miss important features.

Special thanks to Daniel Beck to have given me the "raw" explanation of this unexpected behavior.
