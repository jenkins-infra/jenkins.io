  This blogpost explains why the latest version of a plugin can't be installed on Jenkins in some circumstances.
---


As all Jenkins admin do, I regularly go to my system's Plugin Management page to see what plugins can be upgraded.
Although I am running the latest LTS version, I can't update some key plugins (example the Junit plugin). 
This is even more intriguing as some are part the recommended plugins (default plugin choice).

There is no `install` tick box for that plugin. 
Furthermore, the plugin is labeled `unavailable`.
There is a note saying "_This version of the plugin exists but it is not being offered for installation, so the latest bug fixes or features are not available to you. This is typically the case when plugin requirements, e.g. a recent version of Jenkins, are not satisfied. If you are using the latest version of Jenkins offered to you, newer plugin releases may not be available to your release line yet. See the plugin documentation for information about its requirements._".

Why is this happening now? 
Did I miss something?

As part of the continuous improvement of Jenkins, some critical and high impact changes have to be introduced.
This is typically the case of Graphical User Interface changes (icons, fonts, layout) as is currently happening.
This set of changes is typically introduced in the cutting edge Jenkins "weekly release". 
Plugins are adapted to take advantage of these changes with a new release.
To avoid incompatibilities, the minimal Jenkins release for that new plugin version is set to the first release

Upgrade often

Thanks to Daniel Beck to have given me the raw explanation of this unexpected behavior.
