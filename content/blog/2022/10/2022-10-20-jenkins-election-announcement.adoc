We are excited to announce the 2022 Jenkins Governance Board elections!
The nomination and voter registration period is now open.
Nominations can be submitted for two link:/project/board[governance board] positions, and all five link:/project/team-leads/[officer] positions, namely: Security, Events, Release, Infrastructure, and Documentation.

Thank you to link:https://github.com/halkeye[Gavin Mogan], link:https://github.com/ewelinawilkosz[Ewelina Wilkosz], link:https://github.com/dduportal[Damien Duportal], link:https://github.com/wadeck[Wadeck Follonier], link:https://github.com/alyssat[Alyssa Tong], link:https://github.com/timja[Tim Jacomb], and link:https://github.com/MarkEWaite[Mark Waite] for all of your work over the last term. 

These roles are crucial to the expanding community and continued progress of Jenkins.
This is an opportunity for Jenkins contributors and community members to sign-up to vote in elections, and acknowledge other community members by nominating them for a position.
The deadline for nominations and voter registration is *November 9th*.

Participation in the election process requires an account on link:https://community.jenkins.io[community.jenkins.io].
You can use your Github account or create a new discourse account for link:https://community.jenkins.io[community.jenkins.io].
Additionally, you must be able to showcase at least one contribution done before the September 1st, 2022.
As mentioned on link:/participate/[jenkins.io/participate], they are many different ways to contribute to Jenkins despite having different scopes.
This makes it difficult to consistently measure contributions.
Therefore, we are trusting participants and not requiring that you provide evidence of contribution as part of your voter registration.
We reserve the right to ban the specific account from the election process if we identify abuse.

The election has 3 stages:
* Nomination and voter registration
* Voting
* Results announcement
