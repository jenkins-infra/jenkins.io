We are excited to announce the 2022 Jenkins Governance Board elections!
The nomination and voter registration period is now open.
Nominations can be submitted for two link:/project/board[governance board] positions, and all five link:/project/team-leads/[officer] positions (Security, Events, Release, Infrastructure, and Documentation).

Many thanks to link:https://github.com/halkeye[Gavin Mogan] and link:https://github.com/ewelinawilkosz[Ewelina Wilkosz] for serving on the link:/project/board/[Jenkins Governance Board].
We also want to thank link:https://github.com/dduportal[Damien Duportal] as link:/project/team-leads/#infrastructure[Infrastructure Lead], link:https://github.com/wadeck[Wadeck Follonier] as link:/project/team-leads/#security[Security Officer], link:https://github.com/alyssat[Alyssa Tong] as link:/project/team-leads/#events[Events Officer], link:https://github.com/timja[Tim Jacomb] as link:/project/team-leads/#release[Release Officer], and link:https://github.com/MarkEWaite[Mark Waite] as link:/project/team-leads/#documentation[Documentation Officer] for all of their work over the last term. 

These roles are crucial to the expanding community and continued progress of Jenkins.
This is an opportunity for Jenkins contributors and community members to sign up to vote in elections, and acknowledge other community members by nominating them for a position.

The election consists of 4 phases:

* Nomination of candidates (October 20 - November 10)
* Voter registration (October 20 - November 17) 
* Voting (November 17 - December 2)
* Results announcement (December 7)

== Voting

Participation in the election process requires registering an account with link:https://community.jenkins.io[community.jenkins.io] and at least one <<contributing,contribution>> made before September 1, 2022.
When registering, you can use an existing Github account or create a new account specifically for link:https://community.jenkins.io[the Jenkins community].
We ask all community members who are interested in voting, and meet the requirements, to join the link:https://community.jenkins.io/g/election-voter-2022[election-voter-2022] group on link:https://community.jenkins.io[community.jenkins.io] during the registration period.
Previous elections utilized their own groups, so joining the link:https://community.jenkins.io/g/election-voter-2022[election-voter-2022 group] is required for participation.

We have made the decision to trust participants and not require that you provide evidence of contribution as part of your voter registration.
We reserve the right to ban any account from the election process if we identify abuse.
Once registration is over, a list of email addresses will be sent to the link:https://civs.cs.cornell.edu[Condorcet Internet Voting Service].
