== September 2022

image:/images/post-images/2022-10-13-jenkins-newsletter/centered-newsletter.png[Jenkins September Newsletter]

Welcome to the Jenkins Newsletter!
This is a compilation of progress within the project, highlighted by Jenkins Special Interest Groups (SIGs) for the month of September.

Happy reading!

== Security Update

* Two security advisories during September with "special" nature for Jenkins core
** One was only impacting very specifically configured instance
** The other was only impacting three successive weekly releases

== Infrastructure Update 

* Dropping JDK8 from all agents and controllers processes with the 2.361.1 September LTS
* Joint-work with JFrog (our sponsor) to decrease the bandwidth usage (50 Tb per month, should be under 10 Tb per month) of the Jenkins' Maven repository repo.jenkins-ci.org
* Digital Ocean renewed their sponsorship with increased credits ($18,000 for 1 year)
* Observability of ci.jenkins.io for plugin developers using Datadog's (also a sponsor) metric collection on ephemeral agents. We hope to also use traces in the future
* New "All-in-one" agent template built with Packer: whether your builds are running on a VM or a container, in AWS, Azure or Digital Ocean, you have the same tools in the same locations

== Platform Update

* Loaner computers for ppc64le are gone
** IBM suspended the loaner machine program
* arm/v7 agent Docker images
* Linux packages use systemd instead of System V init
* Exit lifecycle change in the Docker images
* Blue Ocean container image deprecation (jenkinsci:blueocean)
* Container repository management for Jenkins agents
** Simplifying the release process
* JDK 11 now required since Jenkins 2.357 and 2.361.1 LTS
** Ongoing minor tasks
*** Dropping Java 8 from the Docker agents - merged, not yet released
*** Plugins beginning to require Java 11, ongoing process
** Jenkins works with Java 17 since 2.355 and 2.346.1 LTS
** Ongoing, a few recent reports, working well
** Jenkins infra planning to put one or more of the infra machines on JDK 17
** Timeline indicates end of Java 11 first level maintenance Sep 2023, security fixes for several more years after end of first level maintenance
** More than 11,000 Java 17 installs reporting worldwide with Jenkins in September

== Documentation Update

=== DigitalOcean and Jenkins partnership continues to grow!

Thanks to DigitalOcean's generosity, Jenkins has access to more resources than ever before, such as utilizing the DigitalOcean platform to continue development and share progress made.
We can dedicate our time and resources more fully, allowing users to engage and make an impact.

===  Java 11 or Newer

Beginning with Jenkins 2.357 (released on June 28, 2022) and the forthcoming 2.361.1 LTS release, Jenkins requires Java 11 or newer.
Additionally, beginning with Jenkins 2.355 (released on June 14, 2022) and Jenkins 2.346.1 LTS (released on June 22, 2022), Jenkins supports Java 17.
Plugins have already been prepared in link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-68446[JENKINS-68446].
Use the Plugin Manager to upgrade all plugins before _and_ after upgrading to Jenkins 2.357. 
Read the link:/blog/2022/06/28/require-java-11/[blog post about Java 11 requirement] for more information.

=== Thinking About Contributing to Open Source?

Ponder no more!
We've created the link:/doc/developer/tutorial-improve/["Improve a plugin"] developer tutorial for new contributors.
We'd love to work with you!

=== About Blue Ocean

[NOTE]
.Blue Ocean status
====
Blue Ocean will not receive further functionality updates.
Blue Ocean will continue to provide easy-to-use Pipeline visualization, but it will not be enhanced further.
It will only receive selective updates for significant security issues or functional defects.

Alternative options for Pipeline visualization, such as the link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-stage-view/[Pipeline: Stage View] and link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-graph-view/[Pipeline Graph View] plugins, are available and offer some of the same functionality.
While not complete replacements for Blue Ocean, contributions are encouraged from the community for continued development of these plugins.

The link:/doc/book/pipeline/getting-started/#snippet-generator[Pipeline syntax snippet generator] assists users as they define Pipeline steps with their arguments.
It is the preferred tool for Jenkins Pipeline creation, as it provides online help for the Pipeline steps available in your Jenkins controller.
It uses the plugins installed on your Jenkins controller to generate the Pipeline syntax.
Refer to the link:/doc/pipeline/steps/[Pipeline steps reference] page for information on all available Pipeline steps.

== Advocacy & Outreach Update

=== Jenkins & She Code Africa Contributhon

This program aimed to create a more diverse, inclusive, and innovative culture within the African open source ecosystem, by matching African women in technology with sponsor and mentor open source organizations.
The 6 mentees joined the Jenkins project came from Nigeria, Kenya, and Ghana.
They brought 3 different projects to the Jenkins community:

* link:/blog/2022/08/04/expanding-open-source-in-Africa/#screenshot-updates[Screenshot updates]
* link:/blog/2022/08/04/expanding-open-source-in-Africa/#pipeline-help[Pipeline help]

=== Hacktoberfest

*link:https://github.com/jmMeessen[+++jmMeessen+++]* announced …

September was the perfect time to prepare for Hacktoberfest.
We got a jump start by finding projects to contribute to, adding "Hacktoberfest" tag to projects, or getting familiarized with Git.
To get the deets see the link:/blog/2022/09/15/preptember/[blog post about Preptember].
