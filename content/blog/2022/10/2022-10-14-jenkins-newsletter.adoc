Welcome to the Jenkins Newsletter! This is a compilation of progress
within the project, highlighted by Jenkins Special Interest Groups
(SIGs) for the month of September.

Happy reading!

== Security Update

* Two security advisories during September with “special” nature for Jenkins core
** One was only impacting very specifically configured instance
** The other was only impacting three successive weekly releases

== Infrastructure Update 
* Dropping JDK8 from all agents and controllers processes with the 2.361.1
September LTS
* Joint-work with JFrog (our sponsor) to decrease the bandwidth usage (50
Tb per month, should be under 10 Tb per month) of the Jenkins’ Maven
repository repo.jenkins-ci.org
* Digital Ocean renewed their sponsorship with increase credits ($18,000
for 1 year)
* Observability of ci.jenkins.io for plugin developers using Datadog’s
(also a sponsor) metric collection on ephemeral agents. We hope to also
use traces in the future
* New “All-in-one” agent template built with Packer: whether your builds
are running on a VM or a container, in AWS, Azure or Digital Ocean, you
have the same tools in the same locations

== Platform Update

* Loaner computers for ppc64le are gone
** IBM suspended the loaner machine program
* arm/v7 agent Docker images
* Linux packages use systemd instead of System V init
* Exit lifecycle change in the Docker images
* Container image deprecation for the blueocean container
(jenkinsci:blueocean)
* Container repository management for Jenkins agents
** Simplifying the release process
* JDK 11 now required since Jenkins 2.357 and 2.361.1 LTS
** Ongoing minor tasks
*** Dropping Java 8 from the Docker agents - merged, not yet released
*** Plugins beginning to require Java 11, ongoing process
** Jenkins works with Java 17 since 2.355 and 2.346.1 LTS
** Ongoing, a few recent reports, working well
** Jenkins infra planning to put one or more of the infra machines on JDK
17
** Timeline indicates end of Java 11 first level maintenance Sep 2023,
security fixes for several more years after end of first level
maintenance
** More than 11 000 Java 17 installs reporting worldwide with Jenkins in
September

== Documentation Update

=== DigitalOcean and Jenkins partnership continues to grow!

Thanks to DigitalOcean’s generosity, Jenkins has access to more resources than ever before, such as utilizing the DigitalOcean platform to continue development and share progress made. We can dedicate our time and resources more fully, allowing users to engage and make an impact. Read the story https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2022/09/19/digital-ocean-sponsorship/[+++HERE+++].

===  Java 11 or Newer

Beginning with Jenkins 2.357 (released on June 28, 2022) and the
forthcoming 2.361.1 LTS release, Jenkins requires Java 11 or newer.
Additionally, beginning with Jenkins 2.355 (released on June 14, 2022)
and Jenkins 2.346.1 LTS (released on June 22, 2022), Jenkins supports
Java 17. Plugins have already been prepared in
https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-68446[JENKINS-68446]. Use the
Plugin Manager to upgrade all plugins before _and_ after upgrading to
Jenkins 2.357. Read the post

=== Thinking About Contributing to Open Source?

Ponder no more! We’ve created the
https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/tutorial-improve/["Improve a
plugin"] developer tutorial for new contributors. We’d love to work with
you!

== Advocacy & Outreach Update

=== Jenkins & She Code Africa Contributhon

This program aimed to create a more diverse, inclusive, and innovative
culture within the African open source ecosystem by matching African
women in technology with sponsor and mentor open source organizations.
The 6 mentees joined the Jenkins project came from Nigeria, Kenya, and
Ghana. They brought 3 different projects to the Jenkins community:

September was the perfect time to prepare for Hacktoberfest. We got a
jump start by finding projects to contribute to, adding "Hacktoberfest"
tag to projects, or getting familiarized with Git. Get the deets at
