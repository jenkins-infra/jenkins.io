https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes] is an open-source project by Google that provides a platform for managing Docker containers as a cluster. In their own words:

____
Kubernetes is an open source orchestration system for Docker containers. It handles scheduling onto nodes in a compute cluster and actively manages workloads to ensure that their state matches the users declared intentions. Using the concepts of "labels" and "pods", it groups the containers which make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.
____

Kubernetes-related services by Google are the https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/[Google Container Engine], a Kubernetes-powered platform for hosting and managing Docker containers, and the https://cloud.google.com/tools/container-registry/#overview[Google Container Registry], a private Docker image registry.

Several new Jenkins plugins allow you to make use of Kubernetes and these services:

* The https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Google+Container+Registry+Auth+Plugin[Google Cloud Registry Auth Plugin] allows users to authenticate with the Google Cloud Registry so they can push/pull images. This allows you to use the Google Cloud Registry with existing Docker-related plugins, like https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Docker+build+step+plugin[Docker build step plugin] or https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/CloudBees+Docker+Custom+Build+Environment+Plugin[CloudBees Docker Custom Build Environment Plugin].
* The https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Kubernetes+Plugin[Kubernetes Plugin] implements a cloud provider for Jenkins, and can create agents based on Docker images on-demand on your Kubernetes cluster or the Google Cloud Platform.
