Next week in the US we have a national holiday where, generally speaking, lots of turkey gets converted into left-over turkey sandwiches. For many software developers the Thanksgiving holiday also represents a lull in project schedules, freeing up some time to hack on pet projects or even contribute to open source projects.+++<center>+++image:https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/hacksgiving-platter.png[]+++</center>+++

Taking a cue from the link:/content/adopt-plugin-0[Adopt a Plugin] program that https://github.com/daniel-beck[Daniel] wrote about earlier this month, we thought it would be fun to organize a "virtual hackathon" to coincide with that gap in project schedules. Thus *https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Hacksgiving+2015[Hacksgiving 2015]* was created!

We'll be hosting Hacksgiving *Nov 23rd* and *Nov 24* from 7:00PST - 15:00PST (10:00EST - 18:00EST) and would love for you to join! (https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/226735213/[RSVP here])

*You don't need to know Java to help!* We will have documentation and design hacking going on as well.

We have a few goals for Hacksgiving:

. Introduce new contributors to the process of writing code and/or documentation (https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Hacksgiving+2015#Hacksgiving2015-Documentationhacking[documentation hacking details here]).
. Find some plugins which link:/doc/developer/plugin-governance/adopt-a-plugin#which-plugins-are-currently-up-for-adoption[are up for adoption] new maintainers.
. Clean up or merge some existing plugins which need some care (https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Hacksgiving+2015#Hacksgiving2015-Pluginstocleanup[listed here]).
