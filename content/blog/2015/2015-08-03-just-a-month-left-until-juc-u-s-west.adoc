There's only a month left until https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/us-west[JUC U.S. West on September 2-3]! If you're still on the fence, check out the recaps of JUC Europe talks recently posted to the CloudBees blog. These should give you an idea about the kinds of talks you can expect at a Jenkins User Conference:

* https://blog.cloudbees.com/2015/07/juc-session-blog-series-andrew-phillips.html[How to Optimize Automated Testing with Everyone's Favorite Butler]
* https://blog.cloudbees.com/2015/07/juc-session-blog-series-daniel-spilker.html[Configuration as Code - The Job DSL Plugin]
* https://blog.cloudbees.com/2015/07/juc-session-blog-series-mario-cruz-juc.html[From DevOps to NoOps]

If you're interested in the upcoming Jenkins UI overhaul, make sure to attend https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/us-west/01-02-1500[Gus and Tom's talk] about it. Don't want to wait until JUC to learn more about this? https://groups.google.com/d/msg/jenkinsci-dev/Tiz-LSqCJmg/3CuYzuBXJpsJ[Follow the discussion on the developers mailing list] and contribute through early testing.

This JUC will again have an _Ask The Experts_ booth with several Jenkins experts and developers available there throughout the event. If you want to discuss https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/us-west/01-01-1130[Workflow] with Jesse, or pitch your UI ideas to Gus, this is where you'll be able to do that.
