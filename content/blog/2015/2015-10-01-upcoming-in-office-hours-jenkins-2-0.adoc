I hope many of you have had a chance to see https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/vbXK7JJekFw[the Jenkins 2.0 thread]. +
I'm going to use https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Office+Hours[the office hours next Wednesday] to go through this proposal. +


This is still primarily for developers in the project, as it's "just" a proposal with lots of details unspecified. It's more meant to help people understand where I'm coming from and what goals I have in mind for this effort. +


As always, this will be on Hangout on air. The event page is https://plus.google.com/events/co46heshe6i4io1dsaaj1h3th2c[here], and if you want to participate in the discussion, join https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/hoaevent/AP36tYfvk_ZBO4dCmxysNPfi-R5_xlkgscU-r9WDq_8zXDv6VnN3kg[here]. Read-only viewers should use https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl5xfqtiNko[YouTube] to watch, and you can still send questions in real time to IRC and I'll make sure to https://jenkins-ci.org/content/chat[go through them]. +
