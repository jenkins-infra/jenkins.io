After several months of inactivity, [office hours](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Office+Hours), the bi-weekly meeting of Jenkins users and developers to learn more about Jenkins, are back.

I'll host the first session [next Wednesday at 11 am PDT](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Jenkins+Office+Hours&iso=20150729T11&p1=283&ah=1). This session will be about Stapler, focusing on what Jenkins plugin authors need to know about it, e.g. request routing, form submission handling, or how Jelly/Groovy views work.

While this is going to be a developer-focused session, future session topics will also have Jenkins users as target audience.

For general information on office hours, and how to join, see the [wiki](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Office+Hours).
