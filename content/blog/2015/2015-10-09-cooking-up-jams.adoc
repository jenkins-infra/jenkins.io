There's been some active discussions and planning around https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+Area+Meetup[Jenkins Area Meetups (JAMs)] specifically in the following cities: +

* https://www.meetup.com/Rennes-Jenkins-Area-Meetup/[Rennes, France]
* Seville, Spain
* Seattle, Washington
* Barcelona,Spain
* https://www.meetup.com/Raleigh-Jenkins-Area-Meetup/[Raleigh, North Carolina]
* https://www.meetup.com/Atlanta-Jenkins-Meetup/[Atlanta, Georgia]


I wanted to gauge Jenkins interests in these cities, so let us know at jenkinsci-jam@googlegroups.com if you live in one of these areas, and if you would be interested in becoming a member or be involved in JAM one way or another!


Of course, if the city you live in currently does not have a JAM and you're interested in paying it forward, https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+Area+Meetup[here's HOW YOU can become a JAM organizer.]
