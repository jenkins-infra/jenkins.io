As I mentioned in [yesterday's post](/content/fosdem-2016-travel-grant-program), we're planning a "Contributor Summit" on February 1st, after [FOSDEM 2016](https://fosdem.org/2016) (January 30th/31st), to focus on Jenkins 2.0. Since many of us [are already planning](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/FOSDEM+2016), the Monday following the event turned out to be the ideal time to discuss 2.0.

*Note:* If you're not already familiar with some of the key proposals that were put forth, you can review them in the [Jenkins 2.0 proposals summery page](/content/jenkins-20-proposals).


We've hosted [one](https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/203777932/) or [two](https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/126595572/) Contributor Summits in the past, and they're usually a day-long event where we try to gather a number of Jenkins core/plugin developers and active/power users to have detailed discussions around the theme of the summit. For this "Jenkins 2.0 Contributor Summit" we do not have a complete agenda yet, but we will post that to the [Meetup event](https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/227463345/) once it is fully prepared in the next couple weeks.

Suffice it to say, we'll be discussing a lot!


### Venue and RSVP

The Contributor Summit will be hosted in a [CloudBees](https://cloudbees.com) office at: [Rue des Colonies, 11, Brussels, Belgium](https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=Rue+des+Colonies%2C+11%2C+Belgium%2C+be). If you're already planning on attending FOSDEM, the office is near Grand Place and Cafe Delerium (where the Friday beer event is hosted).

The venue is of limited size, so if you're planning to join us, **please** RSVP to [the Meetup event](https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/227463345/) as soon as you're certain you will be able to attend. If you find yourself unable to attend, please remove yourself from the list to ensure that we can fit as many active contributors into the office as possible!
