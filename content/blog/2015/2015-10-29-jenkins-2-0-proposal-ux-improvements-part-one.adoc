We have been featuring a few proposals this week for what "https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+2.0[Jenkins
2.0]" is going to include. Today we'll be diving into the most noticeable changes being proposed for Jenkins 2.0: the User Experience (UX) improvements

Thus far in this blog series we have reviewed proposals covering:

* link:/content/jenkins-20-proposal-introduce-policy-api-deprecation[Introducing a policy for API deprecation]
* link:/content/jenkins-20-proposal-split-groovy-out-core[Splitting Groovy out of 'core']
* link:/content/jenkins-20-proposal-pipeline-code-front-and-center[Pipeline as code front and center]

The UX improvements being proposed aren't necessarily as uniform as the proposals from earlier in the week but represent a large amount of prototype and exploratory work done by folks like https://github.com/tfennelly[Tom Fennelly], https://github.com/gusreiber[Gus Reiber] and a few others. Those following the dev list may have already seen some of these proposals in some of the "mega threads" that we have had discussing potential UI/UX improvements previously.

The improvements proposed for 2.0 can be found under *https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-31156[JENKINS-31156]*. The most promising proposal under this issue is to update the https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-9802[plugin manager experience].+++<center>++++++<iframe width="480" height="360" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9vPUMe3lzfo?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">++++++</iframe>+++ +

Another very important proposal for 2.0 worth mentioning is the proposal to https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-21092[update UI work well on mobile devices].
