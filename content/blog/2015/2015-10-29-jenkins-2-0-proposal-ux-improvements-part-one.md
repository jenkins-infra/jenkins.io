We have been featuring a few proposals this week for what "[Jenkins
2.0](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+2.0)" is going to include. Today we'll be diving into the most noticeable changes being proposed for Jenkins 2.0: the User Experience (UX) improvements

Thus far in this blog series we have reviewed proposals covering:

* [Introducing a policy for API deprecation](/content/jenkins-20-proposal-introduce-policy-api-deprecation)
* [Splitting Groovy out of 'core'](/content/jenkins-20-proposal-split-groovy-out-core)
* [Pipeline as code front and center](/content/jenkins-20-proposal-pipeline-code-front-and-center)

The UX improvements being proposed aren't necessarily as uniform as the proposals from earlier in the week but represent a large amount of prototype and exploratory work done by folks like [Tom Fennelly](https://github.com/tfennelly), [Gus Reiber](https://github.com/gusreiber) and a few others. Those following the dev list may have already seen some of these proposals in some of the "mega threads" that we have had discussing potential UI/UX improvements previously.

The improvements proposed for 2.0 can be found under **[JENKINS-31156](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-31156)**. The most promising proposal under this issue is to update the [plugin manager experience](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-9802).

Another very important proposal for 2.0 worth mentioning is the proposal to [update UI work well on mobile devices](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-21092).
