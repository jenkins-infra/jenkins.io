We're currently setting up a program to support community members' travel to Jenkins community events. Our goal is to enable more members of the community to meet each other and exchange ideas in person.

We're still hashing out the details, but it'll be available to every Jenkins community member. Apply, telling us what Jenkins-related event you'd like to attend and how awesome you are, and we may support your travel with up to 500 USD. For details on how this will work, see the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Travel+Grant+Program[current draft of the travel grant program].

The first person to be supported in this way is Pradeepto Bhattacharya from Pune, India. He was https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/europe/01-01-1400-bhattacharya[a speaker at this year's JUC Europe] in London, and will give https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/us-west/02-02-1400[two] https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/us-west/02-02-1130[talks] at https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/us-west[JUC US West] next week--and we help him get there! He asked us a few weeks back whether the Jenkins project could support his trip to the US. We came to the conclusion that this would be a good idea--so good in fact, that we decided to build a regular program from it.

Are you planning to attend a JUC or similar event, but worry about the cost of travel? We may be able to help you out!
