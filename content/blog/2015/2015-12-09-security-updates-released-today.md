We released Jenkins updates today that include important security fixes: 1.641 and 1.625.3. For detailed information about the security content of these updates, see the [security advisory](/security/advisory/2015-12-09/).

One of these fixes, SECURITY-95, results in possible problems in plugins such as **Maven Plugin**, **Javadoc Plugin**, and **HTML Publisher Plugin**, so make sure to [read all about that in the documentation](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/system-administration/security/configuring-content-security-policy).

Please note that the update site may lag a bit behind. If you want to update as soon as possible, download the releases from our site.
