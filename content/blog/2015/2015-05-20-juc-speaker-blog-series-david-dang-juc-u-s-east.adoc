I’ve implemented numerous test automation projects for clients, but recently I had a unique request. Jenkins plays a critical role.


The “digital channel” is an industry buzzword for many companies these days. The digital channel represents a company’s content that is delivered by websites and mobile devices. Companies want the same website to work across any channel in multiple browsers and different operating systems. They also want that same website to work across an explosion of mobile devices. Add the new generation of smart watches showing up and testing is becoming a huge challenge for IT departments. One big issue is there is too much duplication of testing efforts.


In a perfect world, you would create a core set of test automation scripts that work across all digital channels. A client recently requested that my team and I create this perfect-world scenario, and we are doing just that. Jenkins pulls it all together by managing the execution and reporting.


Join me for my talk to learn how I’m using Jenkins, Selenium, TestNG, and Perfecto Mobile to solve the digital channel testing challenges for one client.
