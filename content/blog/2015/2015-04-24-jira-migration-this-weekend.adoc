In continuing https://jenkins-ci.org/content/confluence-migration-weekend[my infra upgrade work], this weekend I'll be migrating JIRA to another server.

This will make upgrade more manageable and testable. The service will be disrupted for a few hours. Check out our https://twitter.com/jenkinsci/[@jenkinsci on Twitter] for up-to-the-minute status.

Once the migration is done, the next step is to upgrade them.
