Although December is a short month due to the holidays, there has been a good
amount of local Jenkins activities that took place regardless of holiday
obligations. Today and tomorrow I will be doing a series of posts to summarize
December JAM World Tour. Special thanks to the JAM organizers and co-organizers
who made it all happen in these cities:

* Lima, Peru
* St.Petersburg, Russia
* Toulouse, France
* Bay Area, CA

On December 9 https://www.meetup.com/Lima-Jenkins-Area-Meetup/[Lima JAM]
hosted their first Jenkins meetup in Lima, Peru. There were attendance from
various roles of DevOps: Dev, QA, and Ops. There was also a good mixture of
different levels of Jenkins users, some were new and just starting to use
Jenkins while others had extensive Jenkins experience.

The group has been invited by Docker and Ansible meetup organizers for a joint
event in January to showcase technologies from Jenkins, Docker, and Ansible.
Congrats to Lima JAM group.
