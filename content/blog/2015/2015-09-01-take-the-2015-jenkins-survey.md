<p>Just as in past years, <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/Jenkins2015">we are running a survey</a> this year, to get some objective insights into what our users would like to see in the Jenkins project. Obviously, the developers in the project deal with individual bug reports and feature requests all the time, but sometimes those day-to-day issues distract you from a bigger picture.</p>

<p>This year, we kept some of the questions the same, so that we can see the trend over time. But we also wanted to bring in some questions around how you are using Jenkins and what other technologies you leverage such as Linux containers and cloud services.</p>

<p>The survey will close at the end of September and, if you participate, you'll get to see the results first. CloudBees is sponsoring the survey and as an added incentive for us to fill it out, CloudBees has pitched in a $100 Amazon gift card (thanks CloudBees!). Information you submit is only going to be used by the community and not by CloudBees. So please take the survey and let your voice be heard.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.cloudbees.com/2015/09/jenkins-community-survey-your-chance-to.html">Finally, there are laws that govern prize giveaways like this and CloudBees has put up terms and conditions for this.</a></p>
