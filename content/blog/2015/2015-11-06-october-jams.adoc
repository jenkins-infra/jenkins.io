It is great to see the pick up of local activities through hosted JAMs. In October, the Jenkins community hosted https://www.meetup.com/Atlanta-Jenkins-Meetup/events/225877826/[Atlanta JAM] and https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/225860998/[Bay Area JAM]. Many thanks to our sponsors: https://www.ericsson.com/[Ericsson], https://www.cloudbees.com/[CloudBees], https://blazemeter.com/[Blazemeter], https://www.netroadshow.com/nrs/wp/default.html[NetRoadShow].

Here's a summary of what was discussed:

* https://www.meetup.com/Atlanta-Jenkins-Meetup/events/225877826/[Atlanta] JAM - Jenkins workflow and Docker to reduce friction in DevOps efforts.
* https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/225860998/[Bay Area] JAM- Performance testing strategies, incorporating performance tests into Jenkins workflows and the metrics that matter most for troubleshooting and diagnosing issues.

A look forward to November and December:
