On December 15, the [Toulouse
JAM](http://www.meetup.com/Toulouse-Java-User-Group/events/226522097/?eventId=226522097)
was co-hosted with the [Toulouse
JUG](http://www.toulousejug.org/2015/11/06/jenkins.html) and [Toulouse
DevOps](http://toulousedevops.org/). Indeed it made sense since Jenkins is
written in Java, makes use of Groovy code in many places (system groovy script,
job dsl, workflow...), and it also made sense to co-organize with the local
DevOps community since Jenkins is also a great tool to enable Continuous
Integration, Continuous Delivery and automation in general. There were 103
RSVPs, with 80 to 90 people in attendance.

There were 3 talks planned for the evening:

* [Job DSL
  Intro](http://fr.slideshare.net/gmahieux/jenkins-job-dsl-plugin-56347061) [fr], by [Ghislain Mahieux](https://twitter.com/ghislainmahieux)
* [Workflow plugin](http://mpailloncy.github.io/presentations/jenkins-workflow-plugin/index.html) [fr], by [Michaël Pailloncy](https://twitter.com/mpailloncy) (co-maintainer of the [Build Trigger Badge plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Build+Trigger+Badge+Plugin))
* [Feedback on almost 10 years of CI and what's upcoming](http://batmat.github.io/presentations/rex-forge-2015/prez.html) [fr], demo with [Jenkins build scaling with Docker Swarm](https://twitter.com/bmathus/status/677271839282999297), by [Baptiste Mathus](https://twitter.com/bmathus)


NOTE: presentations have been recorded (in french). They are still being processed, and once they are posted we will update this blog.
