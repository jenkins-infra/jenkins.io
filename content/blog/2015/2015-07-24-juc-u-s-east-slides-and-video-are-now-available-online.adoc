https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/us-east[Slides and video from JUC U.S. East] are now available online!


If you attended the conference, *THANK YOU*, and I'm sure you had fun, learned a lot and met many people from the Jenkins community. Now you can revisit your https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/us-east/01-02-1400-glick[favorite talks] or "attend" the ones that you missed.


If you were unable to attend JUC U.S. East, you now have the https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/us-east[slides and video] so you can "attend" anyways! If you like what you see and would like to attend a JUC this year, there is *ONE* date left in the 2015 Jenkins User Conference World Tour: *JUC U.S. West is September 2-3 in Santa Clara, CA. https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/us-west[Register here.]*
