Thank you to https://www.netflix.com/[Netflix] for sponsoring the yummy
burrito bar and offered up their brand new auditorium to host Jenkins
Developers and Users Meetup group on Dec 16. We had 96 RSVPs which was
impressive. Our speaker for the evening was *Akshay Dayal*, Software Engineer at
Google. Akshay's session was about Scaling Jenkins - how and why Google decided
to scale their existing Jenkins cluster (OSS) to meet their
security/availability and failover requirements and how heavy automation played
an important role in this effort.

The second talk was about how Google worked with Jenkins to read config data
externally. Slides are listed below. The video will be posted on https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/226844066/[the meetup
page]) once it becomes
available.

Slides for the talks are linked below:
