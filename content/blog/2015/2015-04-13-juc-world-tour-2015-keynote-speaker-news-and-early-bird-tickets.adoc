The 2015 JUC World Tour dates are rapidly approaching. Since the community has grown so tremendously since last year, the JUC in each city will be the largest gathering of Jenkins users in that region.

 +
 +

https://twitter.com/kohsukekawa[Kohsuke] will, as always, be the opening keynote speaker at each JUC. But, with the conference going from one to two days, I am happy to announce that http://www.realgenekim.me/[Gene Kim] will be another keynote on the second day! He is the author of https://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262592/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=8-1&qid=1428523232[The Phoenix Project] and a thought leader in DevOps.

 +
 +

To have these two experts in one place will provide a great opportunity to talk about Jenkins as the foundation of continuous delivery and DevOps practices.

 +
 +

Another exciting announcement: the 2015 Jenkins World Tour will run alongside the CD Summit conferences for both days (at the U.S. East, Europe and U.S. West locations only). Attendees of either conference can attend any of the talks and presentations at both events. Learn more about what https://www.cloudbees.com/cdsummit[CD Summit 2014] was like to get an idea for https://www.cloudbees.com/cdsummit-2015/[this year's event.]
