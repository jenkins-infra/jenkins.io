Last week we hosted our first [Hacksgiving](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Hacksgiving+2015) event, a two-day virtual hackathon with a number of recorded sessions and plenty of pull requests submitted, [I](https://github.com/rtyler) would say it was a success! I would like to thank everybody who took the time to watch, chat and present in the Hacker Hangout.

Now that everybody has had time to recover from the turkey and travel, we have some videos of the sessions sliced out and ready for publication.

In addition to the recorded sessions, there were a number of notes captured with useful links associated with practically each session. You can find those notes [at the bottom of the Hacksgiving page](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Hacksgiving+2015#Hacksgiving2015-HacksgivingNotes).

*Note:* The following videos are all available in this [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN7ajX_VdyaOX2dHsUpLGUMewG_TFdsP2)

### Intro to the Jenkins project

This session was hosted by [rtyler](https://github.com/rtyler) and meant to provide a cursory overview of where to get started with contributing to the Jenkins project

### Intro to Plugin Development Workshop

This session was given both days of Hacksgiving by [schristou](https://github.com/christ66) and does a really great job of introducing the viewer to getting started with developing a Jenkins plugin with Java.

### Workflow Q&A and Demo Session

This session was not originally scheduled, but some folks on the Jenkins [IRC channel](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/IRC+Channel) had some [Workflow](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin) questions and [Jesse Glick](https://github.com/jglick) jumped into the Hacker Hangout to help us out!

### Internationalization Live Coding / Q&A

Another impromptu session, this time with [danielbeck](https://github.com/daniel-beck) hosting. In this session Daniel walks through a plugin he was working on for Hacksgiving and adds internationalization support while answering a few questions here and there.

### Intro to the new static site


Kicking off day two of Hacksgiving, [rtyler](https://github.com/rtyler) hosted a session on the new [statically-generated Jenkins site](https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins.io). The new site will dramatically lower the barrier to entry for contribution to Jenkins documentation and blogs, by pushing everything through GitHub.

### Plugin Developer Open Q&A

This was the last session of Hacksgiving, hosted by [abayer](https://github.com/abayer) and ended up being more like a casual discussion of the current status and future work in the plugin development ecosystem.
