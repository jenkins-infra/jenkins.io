Next week in the US we have a national holiday where, generally speaking, lots of turkey gets converted into left-over turkey sandwiches. For many software developers the Thanksgiving holiday also represents a lull in project schedules, freeing up some time to hack on pet projects or even contribute to open source projects.

Taking a cue from the [Adopt a Plugin](/content/adopt-plugin-0) program that [Daniel](https://github.com/daniel-beck) wrote about earlier this month, we thought it would be fun to organize a "virtual hackathon" to coincide with that gap in project schedules. Thus **[Hacksgiving 2015](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Hacksgiving+2015)** was created!

We'll be hosting Hacksgiving **Nov 23rd** and **Nov 24** from 7:00PST - 15:00PST (10:00EST - 18:00EST) and would love for you to join! ([RSVP here](https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/226735213/))

**You don't need to know Java to help!** We will have documentation and design hacking going on as well.


We have a few goals for Hacksgiving:

1. Introduce new contributors to the process of writing code and/or documentation ([documentation hacking details here](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Hacksgiving+2015#Hacksgiving2015-Documentationhacking)).
1. Find some plugins which [are up for adoption](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Adopt+a+Plugin#AdoptaPlugin-Whichpluginsarecurrentlyupforadoption%3F) new maintainers.
1. Clean up or merge some existing plugins which need some care ([listed here](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Hacksgiving+2015#Hacksgiving2015-Pluginstocleanup)).

### Sessions to note

Here are some of the [sessions scheduled](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Hacksgiving+2015#Hacksgiving2015-Schedule) that will be hosted by members of community that may interest you:


**Day One**

* 7:00PST/10:00EST (*15-30min*) - [rtyler](https://github.com/rtyler) will host a welcome and introduction to contribution to the Jenkins project (walking through our [contributors guide](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Beginners+Guide+to+Contributing))
* 10:00PST/13:00EST (*60min*) - [schristou](https://github.com/christ66) will host a workshop titled "Introduction to plugin development for Jenkins"


**Day Two**

Hacksgiving is very [unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) structured right now, so if you're interested in hosting a session please let us know in the `#jenkins-community` channel or by signing up for a session on [the schedule](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Hacksgiving+2015#Hacksgiving2015-Schedule)


### How to participate


Since this is a virtual hackathon, we'll be congregating and chatting in a couple of ways:

* On the `#jenkins` [IRC channel](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/IRC+Channel) as per usual
* We'll be hosting sessions and tutorials via Google Hangouts, see the "[hacker hangout](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Hacksgiving+2015#Hacksgiving2015-HackerHangout)* section on the wiki page up to date details
* Via the `#hacksgiving` hashtag on Twitter


You can also RSVP on our [meetup page!](https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/226735213/)


We hope you can join in the festivities!
