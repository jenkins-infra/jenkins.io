On December 15, the https://www.meetup.com/Toulouse-Java-User-Group/events/226522097/?eventId=226522097[Toulouse
JAM]
was co-hosted with the https://www.toulousejug.org/2015/11/06/jenkins.html[Toulouse
JUG] and https://toulousedevops.org/[Toulouse
DevOps]. Indeed it made sense since Jenkins is
written in Java, makes use of Groovy code in many places (system groovy script,
job dsl, workflow...), and it also made sense to co-organize with the local
DevOps community since Jenkins is also a great tool to enable Continuous
Integration, Continuous Delivery and automation in general. There were 103
RSVPs, with 80 to 90 people in attendance.

There were 3 talks planned for the evening:
