Congratulations! The Jenkins project officially went over the 100K active users mark sometime in January. As of January 31, https://stats.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins-stats/svg/total-jenkins.svg[we were at 102,992]. YOU are one of the 100K active users! +
 +

 +
As discussed on http://meetings.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins/2015/[a couple recent project meetings], we have designated *February 26* as Jenkins Celebration Day. +
 +

 +
To make some noise, here is what we are doing starting NOW: +
 +

*  +
Write a blog about anything related to Jenkins. Post your blog and Tweet out a link to it. Include the hashtag *#Jenkins100K* in your post. +
 +
*  +
On February 26, we will hold a raffle and pick four names at random. The grand prize winner will get a https://jenkins-ci.org/content/jenkins-figure-available-shapeways[3D Jenkins Butler model]. Five others will get their pick of Jenkins swag (up to $20) from https://www.cafepress.com/jenkinsci[the Jenkins online store]. +
 +

 +
 +

== OTHER WAYS TO CELEBRATE

There are a number of other things planned and we want YOU to be involved. This blog post is the central place to come for all things related to the celebration. +

Feel free to use the badge as long as you want – but let’s get as many of us using it as possible between now and February 27. +
