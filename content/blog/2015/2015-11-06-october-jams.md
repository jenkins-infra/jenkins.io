<p>It is great to see the pick up of local activities through hosted JAMs. In October, the Jenkins community hosted <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Atlanta-Jenkins-Meetup/events/225877826/">Atlanta JAM</a> and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/225860998/">Bay Area JAM</a>. Many thanks to our sponsors: <a href="https://www.ericsson.com/">Ericsson</a>, <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/">CloudBees</a>, <a href="https://blazemeter.com/">Blazemeter</a>, <a href="https://www.netroadshow.com/nrs/wp/default.html">NetRoadShow</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/Atlanta-Jenkins-Meetup/events/225877826/">Atlanta</a> JAM - Jenkins workflow and Docker to reduce friction in DevOps efforts.</li>
