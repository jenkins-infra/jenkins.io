For the past several years we've been attending [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org), a massive free and open source event in Brussels, Belgium. In preparation for this upcoming FOSDEM (2016) event, we will be hosting an open planning meeting via Google Hangouts during this week's "[Office Hours](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Office+Hours)."


**Agenda:**

* Gauge who can participate and at what capacity.
* Pre-FOSDEM Contributor Summit
* After-hours meetup/happy hour
* Plans for a Jenkins stand (assuming we're accepted):
 * What demo materials
 * Schwag
 * Revised [Jenkins Flyer](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+Flyer)


The [FOSDEM 2016](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/FOSDEM+2016) wiki page is where we will be recording plans and [tasks will be added to JIRA](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=11). If you cannot join us via the **[FOSDEM Office Hours Hangout](https://hangouts.google.com/call/m5tymcvzqdudu7r7cvvylqn4hya)**, we will also be watching the `#jenkins-community` channel on the [Freenode](https://freenode.net) network if you cannot participate directly.


Please join us on [this Google Hangout](https://hangouts.google.com/call/m5tymcvzqdudu7r7cvvylqn4hya) at 11:00 a.m. PDT this Wednesday (Oct 21)
