Combining Jenkins and [Docker](https://www.docker.io) together can bring improved speed and consistency to your automation tasks, which is why we've collected some *hopefully* helpful resources on this page to get you started!

## What's Docker?

> *[Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_%28software%29) is an open-source project that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers, by providing an additional layer of abstraction and automation of operating-system-level virtualization on Linux.*
(*courtesy Wikipedia*)

What this offers to Jenkins users is a means to isolate different jobs from one another, quickly clean a job's workspace or even dynamically deploy or schedule jobs with Docker containers to increase resource utilization and efficiency.

## Resources
