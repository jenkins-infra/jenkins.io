Gus Reiber will host this week's office hour on [Wednesday, 11 AM PDT](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Jenkins+Office+Hours&iso=20150909T11&p1=283&ah=1). He'll talk about some of the UI/UX improvements in Jenkins that he's working on, and will answer your questions about it.

He's already given several talks about this, so you can check these out to learn more before the office hour:

* [JUC US West](https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/us-west/01-02-1500)

There are also some mailing list threads where he's discussing his designs with the community:

* [July discussion](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/jenkinsci-dev/Tiz-LSqCJmg/3CuYzuBXJpsJ)

The links to the Google Hangout (participate) and Youtube (watch live) [will be posted to the wiki before the event](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Office+Hours). If you don't get into the Hangout (limited number of participants), don't worry: You'll be able to send questions and suggestions to his [Twitter account @gusreiber](https://twitter.com/gusreiber).
