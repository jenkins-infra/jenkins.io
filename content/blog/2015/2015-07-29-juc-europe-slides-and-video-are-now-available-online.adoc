https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/europe[Slides and video from JUC Europe] are now available online!


If you made it to London to attend this year's JUC Europe, https://flic.kr/p/uER3fe[*I hope you enjoyed the conference*], met plenty of community members and learned more about Jenkins. Now that the slides and video are up, you can revisit your https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/europe/02-02-1130-cruz[favorite talks] or "attend" the ones that you missed...all at your leisure.


If you were unable to attend JUC Europe, well, now you can! The slides and video are https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/europe[here] so you can "attend" any time you want. If JUC LIVE seems more appealing to you, there is *one* date left in the 2015 Jenkins User Conference World Tour: *JUC U.S. West is September 2-3 in Santa Clara, CA. https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/us-west[Register here.]*
