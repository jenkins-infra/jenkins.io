Uday made a blog post yesterday that he is looking at organizing a regular Jenkins meet-up in the Silicon Valley Bay Area dubbed "Bay Area Jenkins Area Meetup (JAM)."

 +
 +

 +
As a first step, he wants to have a kick-off meeting, to get more insights and opinions about what the topics could be and what people want to hear. I'm really looking forward to it as a means to build a local network, so I signed myself up as a speaker of the first meet-up.

If you are in the Peninsula, South Bay, East Bay, etc., please send some encouragements to him by posting a comment, or better yet, come to the kick-off meeting.
