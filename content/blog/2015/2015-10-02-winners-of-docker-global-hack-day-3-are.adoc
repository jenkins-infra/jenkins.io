Over 2,000 members of the Docker community attended https://www.docker.com/community/hackathon[Docker Hack Day] events around the world. One of the forty-two Docker Hacks has some familiar names attached...


https://twitter.com/ndeloof[Nicolas De Loof] and https://twitter.com/yoanndubreuil[Yoann Dubreuil] from https://www.meetup.com/docker-rennes[Docker Rennes], who are also active in our community, waved the Jenkins flag in this event and produced https://github.com/ndeloof/docker-slaves-plugin[Jenkins docker agents plugin].


This plugin lets you run builds inside containers, and in that sense it's similar to https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Docker+Plugin[the Docker plugin] and https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/CloudBees+Docker+Custom+Build+Environment+Plugin[the Docker custom build environment plugin]. But internally it uses a quite interesting approach. +


____
This fresh new implementation relies on a set of docker containers (aka ‘pod’) to setup a build executor, letting development team customize the build environment for their need without any constraint or prerequisite, and relying on docker containers to host test resources.

This project https://blog.docker.com/2015/09/docker-global-hack-day-3-winners/[won the 3rd place in the Freestyle category of Docker Hack Day]. Congratulations to Nicolas and Yoann on their win! Jenkins + Docker is a winning pair and this plugin will make a huge difference in your projects.
