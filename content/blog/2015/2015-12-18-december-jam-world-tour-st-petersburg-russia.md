The [first Jenkins meetup](https://www.meetup.com/St-Petersburg-Jenkins-Meetup/events/226875933/) in Saint Petersburg, Russia took place on December
9th. The event has been organized with the help from [Yandex](https://yandex.com/company/) and [CloudBees](https://www.cloudbees.com/).

In total there were about 80 attendees at the meetup. In addition to
[meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/St-Petersburg-Jenkins-Meetup/events/226875933/)
the event has been promoted by Yandex so we quickly reached capacity limit.

There were 3 talks conducted, speakers from Yandex, ZeroTurnaround and
CloudBees. We discussed the current open-source project state, ongoing
activities in the community, Jenkins-powered CD case studies from
ZeroTurnaround and Jenkins plugin development approaches.
