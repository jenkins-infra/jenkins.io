We released Jenkins updates today that include important security fixes: 1.641 and 1.625.3. For detailed information about the security content of these updates, see the link:/security/advisory/2015-12-09/[security advisory].

One of these fixes, SECURITY-95, results in possible problems in plugins such as *Maven Plugin*, *Javadoc Plugin*, and *HTML Publisher Plugin*, so make sure to link:/doc/book/system-administration/security/configuring-content-security-policy[read all about that in the documentation].

Please note that the update site may lag a bit behind. If you want to update as soon as possible, download the releases from our site.
