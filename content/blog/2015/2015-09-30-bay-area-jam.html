<p>Last week, the first <a href="https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/225059665/">Jenkins Area Meetup (JAM)</a> took place in San Jose, CA on Wednesday, Sept 23.  What a way to kick off the first JAM other than to have Docker, John Willis as our guest speaker. John talked about <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/botchagalupe/devops-and-immutable-infrastructure-cloud-expo-2015-nyc">immutable infrastructure</a> and its benefits and role of containers.</p><br/>
 <br/>
<p>Kohsuke discussed <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Workflow+Plugin">Jenkins Workflow</a>, the motivation behind the same and latest features of Jenkins Workflow like <a href="https://developer-blog.cloudbees.com/2015/08/workflow-19-and-multibranch-beta.html">multi branch support</a> followed by <a href="https://blog.cloudbees.com/2015/06/building-modern-real-world-software.html">docker use cases</a>. The highlight of the meetup was definitely Kohsuke breaking the news about Jenkins 2.0 and his vision and motivation behind it.</p><br/>
 <br/>
