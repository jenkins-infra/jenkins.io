https://github.com/jglick/[Jesse Glick] will host the next office hour https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Jenkins+Office+Hours&iso=20150812T11&p1=283&ah=1[this Wednesday, 11 AM PDT] on https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin#introduction[Workflow].

Workflow has been Jesse's project for the last year or so. If you don't know what Workflow is, check out these talks about it from past JUCes:

* https://www.cloudbees.com/event/topic/workflow-jenkins[June 2014]
* https://www.cloudbees.com/event/topic/workflow-jenkins-0[October 2014]
* https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/us-east/01-02-1400-glick[June 2015]

This will be a developer-focused session on integrating with Workflow. He'll discuss things like how to make sure your plugin can be used as part of workflows, and best practices for extending the workflow DSL. There's already been a session on Workflow in January, but Jesse hasn't been idle, and there's new stuff to share.
