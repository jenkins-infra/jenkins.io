NOTE: This is a guest post by link:https://github.com/kj187[Julian Kleinhans], 
Software Architect at link:https://www.aoe.com[AOE], who is outlining some of the 
Jenkins dashboard work he's done with
link:https://github.com/fabiocaseri/dashing-js[dashing-js]

Jenkins offers a handful of third party dashboards, but none of them are really
beautiful and flexible enough from my point of view. For example, I could not
find a solution which gives me the possibility to easily decide which data
should be display in the widget and which not. It also doesn`t have the
possibility to add additional widgets to the dashboard which have nothing to do
with Jenkins. So I came up with something interesting that includes Jenkins
data. But I cannot do that with the existing built-in dashboards from Jenkins
plugins which are Jenkins-content specific.

So I decided to write a new, flexible and extensible dashboard. To avoid
re-inventing the wheel I also decided to use
link:https://github.com/fabiocaseri/dashing-js[dashing-js] as a basis and not
Jenkins itself. dashing-js is a Node.js port of
link:https://dashing.io/[Dashing], a link:https://sinatrarb.com[Sinatra]-based
framework that lets you build beautiful dashboards.

The key features of Dashing are:

* Use pre-made widgets, or fully create your own with link:https://sass-lang.com/[Sass], HTML and link:https://coffeescript.org/[CoffeeScript]
* Widgets harness the power of data bindings (via link:https://web.archive.org/web/20160111000701/https://batmanjs.org/[batman.js]) to keep things link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself[DRY] and simple
* Use the API to push data to your dashboards or make use of a simple Node.js script for fetching data
* Drag & drop interface for re-arranging your widgets

The advantage over a native Java-based Jenkins plugin is that you don't need to
know Java and the whole Java stack. You can also easily add other pre-made
third-party widgets, for example a GitHub Pull Request count widget or an AWS
statistic widget or whatever else. In other words, it is completely independent
of Jenkins. All you need is Node.js and the permission to access the
link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Remote+access+API[Jenkins API].

Beside dashing-js you will need my
link:https://kj187.github.io/dashing-jenkins_job/[Jenkins Job widget]. It is a
generic widget for Jenkins jobs which provides a highly visible view of the
build status and build progress of selected Jenkins jobs. Via configuration it
is possible to add multiple widgets for different Jenkins jobs (as you can see
in the screenshot below).

So, all you need is dashing-js, my Jenkins Job widget and some
link:https://npmjs.org[npm] packages.  The installation and the setup is really
easy and can be found link:https://kj187.github.io/dashing-jenkins_job/[here].
