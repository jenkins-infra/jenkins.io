title: "A beautiful Jenkins dashboard"

Jenkins offers a handful of third party dashboards, but none of them is really beautiful and flexible from my point of view.

So I decided to write a new, flexible and extensible dashboard. To avoid re-inventing the wheel I also decided to use link:https://github.com/fabiocaseri/dashing-js[Dashing-JS] as a basis and not Jenkins itself. Dashing-JS is a NodeJS port of link:http://dashing.io/[Dashing], an Sinatra based framework that lets you build beautiful dashboards.

The key features of dashing are:
* Use pre-made widgets, or fully create your own with scss, html and coffeescript
* Widgets harness the power of data bindings (via batman.js) to keep things DRY and simple
* Use the API to push data to your dashboards or make use of a simple nodeJS script for fetching data
* Drag & Drop interface for re-arranging your widgets

The advantage over an native Java Jenkins plugin is, that you dont need to know Java and the whole Java stack and you could add easily other pre-made third party widgets, for example an GitHub Pull Request count widget or an AWS statistic widget or whatever else. In other words, it is completely independent of Jenkins. All you need is NodeJS and the permission to access the Jenkins API.

Beside Dashing-JS you will need my link:goo.gl/X3WM3r[Jenkins Job widget]. It is a generic widget for Jenkins jobs which provides a highly visible view of the build status and build progress of selected Jenkins jobs. Via configuration it is possible to add multiple widgets for different Jenkins jobs (as you can see in the attached screenshot).

So, all you need is Dashing-JS, my Jenkins Job widget and some npm packages. The installation and the setup is really easy and could be find link:goo.gl/X3WM3r[here].
