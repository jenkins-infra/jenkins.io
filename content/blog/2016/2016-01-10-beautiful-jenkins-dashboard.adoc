Jenkins offers a handful of third party dashboards, but none of them is really beautiful and flexible from my point of view.

So I decided to write a new, flexible and extensible dashboard. To avoid re-inventing the wheel I decided to use link:https://github.com/fabiocaseri/dashing-js[Dashing-JS] as a basis and not Jenkins itself. Dashing-JS is a NodeJS port of link:http://dashing.io/[Dashing], an Sinatra based framework that lets you build beautiful dashboards. This is completely independent of Jenkins. All you need is NodeJS and the permission to access the Jenkins API.

Beside Dashing-JS you will need my link:goo.gl/X3WM3r[Jenkins Job widget]. It is a generic widget for Jenkins jobs which provides a highly visible view of the build status and build progress of selected Jenkins jobs. Via configuration it is possible to add multiple widgets for different Jenkins jobs (as you can see in the attached screenshot).

So, all you need is Dashing-JS, my Jenkins Job widget and some npm packages. The installation and the setup is really easy and could be find link:goo.gl/X3WM3r[here].
