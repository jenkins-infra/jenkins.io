As you probably know, Jenkins project has been accepted to
link:https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline[Google Summer of Code 2016]. 

During last month we were working with students in order to discuss their project ideas and to review their application drafts.
Thanks again to all students and mentors for your hard work during about ten office hours and dozens of other calls/chats!

### Current status

* We have successfully handled the student application period
* We have received a bunch of good project proposals (mentors cannot disclose the number)
* We have done the preliminary filtering of applications
* GSoC mentors and organization admins have prepared the project slot application draft

Currently we are *looking for mentors*. 
We have a minimal required number for the current project slot application plan, but additional expertise would allow us to share the load and to provide more expertise to students.
