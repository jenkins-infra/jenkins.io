As we near the end of the year, the number of November JAMs show that the
Jenkins community isn't slowing down for holiday season. We had a number of
excellent events hosted _around the world_ this November with plenty of great
stories and presentations shared by the various members of the world-wide
Jenkins community.

=== Melbourne, Australia JAM

Melbourne JAM leaders,

and

hosted Blue Ocean for the inaugural meeting. Attendees learned the values of
Blue Ocean, a project that rethinks the user experience of Jenkins, modeling
and presenting the process of software delivery by surfacing information that
is important to development teams with as few clicks as possible, while still
staying true to the extensibility that Jenkins always has had as a core value.
Thank you https://github.com/i386[James Dumay] for stopping by to take part in
the inauguration.

=== Singapore, Singapore JAM

One of the members  who had several years of experience using Jenkins (since
Hudson days in fact) to present some basics on Continuous Integration with
GitHub. It was targeted at new members who are starting out with Jenkins. We
understand that we cannot always serve advanced topics to cater to the
experienced users and neglect the newbies so this session was targeted to help
give new users an introduction to Jenkins. It went well with about 15-20
attendees and we hope to run some hands-on workshops in 2017. Some members were
looking forward to freebies like stickers and T-shirts too!

=== Moscow, Russia JAM

Moscow JAM leaders,

and
link:https://github.com/oleg-nenashev[Oleg Nenashev]
led the inaugural meeting with
a packed full agenda. Oleg began the meeting with an update on Jenkins 2 what improvements users can expect and what
enhancements are in the works within the Jenkins project. Following Oleg, Kirill shared
how his team in Alfa Laboratory used Jenkins to improve CD/DevOps in their
projects (with Jenkins Pipeline, Job DSL and
link:/projects/blueocean[Blue Ocean]
), the problems they experienced and how they fixed them. Then Oleg talked
about Jenkins Pipeline internals, main features and recent changes in the
ecosystem. It was followed up by a discussion of large-scale Jenkins instances
at the after-party.

The recording of the event can be found

=== Milan, Italy JAM

The first meetup was a great opportunity to meet local Jenkins fans to learn
and share Jenkins experiences at a local cafe.

=== San Francisco, California JAM

link:https://github.com/rtyler[R. Tyler Croy]
performed a 30 minutes live Pipeline coding demo to a relatively novice
audience (though all had used Jenkins). A good amount of questions from the
audience  which conveyed an appetite for the content being presented.

presenter from ClusterHQ, also gave a demo based around Pipeline talking about
ClusterHQ's "Fli" integration with a delivery pipeline.

=== Washington, DC JAM

There was a fantastic 90% showup rate at this month’s meetup - 58 RSVPs and 52
in attendance was pretty impressive. All this may be due to Fannie Mae’s story
- the success of how they used Jenkins for CI/CD as part of their DevOps
adoption. Afterwards, there was a lot of interests and further discussions
taking place. Next month’s host will be Freddie Mac.

=== Seattle, Washington JAM

Long time Jenkins community member and Seattle JAM leader,
https://github.com/khaido[Khai Do] showed how OpenStack uses "Jenkins Job
Builder" to manage and run thousands of Jenkins jobs per day in their
multi-master CI/CD system.  He also compared
link:https://docs.openstack.org/infra/jenkins-job-builder/[Jenkins Job Builder]
with other Jenkins "Infrastructure-as-code" technologies - Jenkins Pipeline and
Jenkins JobDSL. It was followed by an in-depth Q&A and discussion session.

=== Dallas/Forth Worth, Texas (DFW) JAM

The November DFW JAM was the most strongly attended of the year! DFW JAM leader,
https://github.com/ericsmalling[Eric Smalling] discussed the benefits of
dynamic build agents and demonstrated various ways to implement them such as
the EC2 and Docker plugins. There was a lot of interest and discussion,
especially around Docker and the ability it provides to have ephemeral agents
with very little provisioning time.
