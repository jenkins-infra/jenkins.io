The Jenkins
link:/security[security team]
has been made aware of a new attack vector for a remote code execution
vulnerability in the
link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+CLI[Jenkins CLI],
according to
link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/jenkinsci-advisories/-fc-w9tNEJE/GRvEzWoJBgAJ[this
advisory]
by Daniel Beck:

_____
We have received a report of a possible unauthenticated remote code execution
vulnerability in Jenkins (all versions).

We strongly advise anyone running a Jenkins instance on a public network
disable the CLI for now.

As this uses the same attack vector as SECURITY-218, you can reuse the script
and instructions published in this repository: https://github.com/jenkinsci-cert/SECURITY-218
_____


We have since been able to confirm the vulnerability and strongly recommend
that everyone follow the instructions in the linked repository.

As Daniel mentions in the security advisory, the advised mitigation strategy is
to disable the CLI subsystem via
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci-cert/SECURITY-218/blob/master/cli-shutdown.groovy[this
Groovy script].
If you are a Jenkins administrator, navigate to the 'Manage Jenkins' page and
click on the 'Script Console', which will allow you to run the Groovy script to
immediately disable the CLI.

In order to persist this change across restarts of your Jenkins master, place
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci-cert/SECURITY-218/blob/master/cli-shutdown.groovy[the
Groovy script]
in `$JENKINS_HOME/init.groovy.d/cli-shutdown.groovy` so that Jenkins executes
the script on each boot.


We are expecting to have a fix implemented, tested and included in an updated
weekly and LTS release this upcoming **Wednesday, November 16th**.


For users who are operating Jenkins on public, or otherwise hostile, networks,
we suggest hosting Jenkins behind reverse proxies such as Apache or Nginx.
These can help provide an additional layer of security, when used appropriately,
to cordon off certain URLs such as `/cli`.

Additionally, we strongly recommend that *all* Jenkins administrators subscribe
to the
link:mailto:jenkinsci-advisories+subscribe@googlegroups.com[jenkinsci-advisories@googlegroups.com]
mailing list to receive future advisories.

The Jenkins project has a responsible disclosure policy, which we strongly
encourage anybody who believes they have discovered a potential vulnerability
to follow. You can learn more about this policy and our processes on our
link:/security[security page].
