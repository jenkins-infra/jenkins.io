Hey there, my name is David Hinske and I work at Goodgame Studios (GGS), a game
development company in Hamburg, Germany. As Release Engineer in a company with
several development teams, it comes in handy using several Jenkins instances.
While this approach works fine in our company and gives the developers a lot of
freedom, we came across some long-term problems concerning maintenance and
standards. These problems were mostly caused by misconfiguration or non-use of
plugins. With “configuration as code” in mind, I took the approach to apply
static code analysis with the help of SonarQube, a platform to manage code
quality, for all of our Jenkins job configurations.

As a small centralized team, we were looking for an easy way to control the
health of our growing Jenkins infrastructure. With considering “configuration
as code“, I developed a simple extension of SonarQube, to manage the quality
and usage of all spawned Jenkins instances. The given SonarQube features (like
customized rules/metrics, quality profiles and dashboards) allow us and the
development teams to analyze and measure the quality of all created jobs in our
company. Even though Jenkins configuration analysis cannot cover all
SonarQube's axes of code quality, I think there is still potential for
conventions/standards, duplications, complexity, potential bugs
(misconfiguration) and design and architecture.

The results of this analysis can be used by all people working with Jenkins. To
achieve this, I developed a simple extension of SonarQube, containing
everything which is needed to hook up our SonarQube with our Jenkins
environment. The implementation contains a new basic-language “Jenkins“ and an
initial set of rules.

Of course the needs depend strongly on the way Jenkins is being used, so not
every rule implemented might be useful for every team, but this applies to all
types of code analysis. The main inspirations for the rules were developer
feedback and some articles found in the web. The different ways Jenkins can be
configured provides the potential for many more rules. With this new approach
of quality analysis, we can enforce best practices like:

* Polling must die (Better to triggerb uilds from pushes than poll the
  repository every x minutes).
* Use Log Rotator (Not using log-rotator can result in disk space problems on
  the master).
* Use agents/labels (Jobs should be defined where to run).
* Don’t build on the master (In larger systems, don't build on the master).
* Enforce plugin usage (For example: Timestamp, Mask-Passwords).
* Naming sanity (Limit project names to a sane (e.g. alphanumeric) character
  set).
* Analyze Groovy Scripts (For example: Prevent System.exit(0) in System Groovy
  Scripts).

Besides taking control of all configuration of any Jenkins instance we want,
there is also room for additional metrics, like measuring the amount and
different types of jobs (Freestyle/Maven etc...) to get an overview about the
general load of the Jenkins instance. A more sophisticated idea is to measure
complexity of jobs and even pipelines. As code, jobs configuration gets harder
to understand the more steps are involved. On the one hand scripts, conditions
and many parameters can negatively influence the readability, especially if you
have external dependencies (like scripts) in different locations. On the other
hand, pipelines can also grow very complex when many jobs are involved and
chained for execution. It will be very interesting for us to see where and why
too complex pipelines are being created.

On visualization we rely on the data and its interpretation of SonarQube, which
offers a big bandwidth of widgets. Everybody can use and customize the
dashboards. Our centralized team for example has a separate dashboard where we
can get a quick overview over all instances.

The problem of "growing" Jenkins with maintenance problems is not new.
Especially when you have many developers involved, including with the access to
create jobs and pipelines themselves, an analysis like this SonarQube plugin
provides can be useful for anyone who wants to keep their Jenkins in shape.
Customization and standards are playing a big role in this scenario. This blog
post surely is not an advertisement for my developed plugin, it is more about
the crazy idea of using static code analysis for Jenkins job configuration. I
haven’t seen anything like it so far and I feel that there might be some
potential behind this idea.
