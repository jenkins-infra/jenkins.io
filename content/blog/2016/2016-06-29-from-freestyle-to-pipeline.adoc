For ages I have used the "Build After" feature in Jenkins to cobble together
what one might refer to as a "pipeline" of sorts. The Jenkins project itself, a
major consumer of Jenkins, has used these daisy-chained Freestyle jobs to drive
a myriad of delivery pipelines in our infrastructure.

One such "pipeline" helped drive the complex process of generating the pretty
blue charts on
link:http://stats.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins-stats/svg/svgs.html[stats.jenkins-ci.org].
This statistics generation process primarily performs two major tasks, on rather
large sets of data:

. Generate aggregate monthly "census data."
. Process the census data and create trend charts


The chained jobs allowed us to resume the independent stages of the pipeline,
and allowed us to run different stages on different hardware (different
capabilities) as needed. Below is a diagram of what this looked like:

image::/images/post-images/freestyle-to-pipeline-2016/freestyle-pipeline.png[role=center]


The `infra_generate_monthly_json` would run periodically creating the
aggregated census data, which would then be picked up by `infra_census_push`
whose sole responsibility was to take census data and publish it to the
necessary hosts inside the project's infrastructure.


The second, semi-independent, "pipeline" would also run periodically. The
`infra_statistics` job's responsibility was to use the census data, pushed
earlier by `infra_census_push`, to generate the myriad of pretty blue charts
before triggering the
`infra_checkout_stats` job which would make sure `stats.jenkins-ci.org` was
properly updated.


Suffice it to say, this "pipeline" had grown organically over a period time when
link:/doc/pipeline[more advanced tools] weren't quite available.

When we migrated to newer infrastructure for
link:https://ci.jenkins.io[ci.jenkins.io] earlier this year I took the
opportunity to do some cleaning up. Instead of migrating jobs verbatim, I pruned
stale jobs and refactored a number of others into proper
link:/solutions/pipeline[Pipelines], statistics generation being an obvious
target!

Our requirements for statistics generation, in their most basic form, are:

* Enable a sequence of dependent tasks to be executed as a logical group (a
  pipeline)
* Enable executing those dependent tasks on various pieces of infrastructure
  which support different requirements
* Actually generate those pretty blue charts

If you wish to skip ahead, you can jump straight to the
link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/infra-statistics/blob/a6dcaa29fca9a4f61143954fb9e1300c2f995a89/Jenkinsfile[Jenkinsfile]
which implements our new Pipeline.
--


The first iteration of the `Jenkinsfile` simply defined the conceptual stages we
would need:

[source, groovy]
----

node {
    stage 'Sync raw data and census files'

    stage 'Process raw logs'

    stage 'Generate census data'

    stage 'Generate stats'

    stage 'Publish census'

    stage 'Publish stats'
}
----

How exciting! Although not terrifically useful. When I began actually
implementing the first couple stages, I noticed that the Pipeline might sync
_dozens_ of gigabytes of data every time it ran on a new agent in the cluster.
While this problem will soon be solved by the
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/external-workspace-manager-plugin[External
Workspace Manager plugin], which is currently being developed. Until it's ready,
I chose to mitigate the issue by pinning the execution to a consistent agent.


[source, groovy]
----
/* `census` is a node label for a single machine, ideally, which will be
 * consistently used for processing usage statistics and generating census data
 */
node('census && docker') {
    /* .. */
}
----


Restricting a workload which previously used multiple agents to a single one
introduced the next challenge. As an infrastructure administrator, technically
speaking, I _could_ just install all the system dependencies that I want on this
one special Jenkins agent. But what kind of example would that be setting!

The statistics generation process requires:

* JDK8
* link:https://www.groovy-lang.org[Groovy]
* A running link:https://www.mongodb.org/[MongoDB] instance


Fortunately, with Pipeline we have a couple of useful features at our disposal:
tool auto-installers and the
link:https://go.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-documentation/cje-user-guide/chapter-docker-workflow.html[CloudBees
Docker Pipeline plugin].


=== Tool Auto-Installers

Tool Auto-Installers are exposed in Pipeline through the `tool` step and on
link:https://ci.jenkins.io[ci.jenkins.io] we already had JDK8 and Groovy
available. This meant that the `Jenkinsfile` would invoke `tool` and Pipeline
would automatically install the desired tool on the agent executing the current
Pipeline steps. 

The `tool` step does not modify the `PATH` environment variable, so it's usually
used in conjunction with the `withEnv` step, for example:

[source,groovy]
----
node('census && docker') {
    /* .. */

    def javaHome = tool(name: 'jdk8')
    def groovyHome = tool(name: 'groovy')

    /* Set up environment variables for re-using our auto-installed tools */
    def customEnv = [
        "PATH+JDK=${javaHome}/bin",
        "PATH+GROOVY=${groovyHome}/bin",
        "JAVA_HOME=${javaHome}",
    ]

    /* use our auto-installed tools */
    withEnv(customEnv) {
        sh 'java --version'
    }

    /* .. */
}
----

=== CloudBees Docker Pipeline plugin

Satisfying the MongoDB dependency would still be tricky. If I caved in and installed
MongoDB on a single unicorn agent in the cluster, what could I say the next time
somebody asked for a special, one-off, piece of software installed on our
Jenkins build agents?

After doing my usual complaining and whining, I discovered that the CloudBees
Docker Pipeline plugin provides the ability to *run containers* inside of a
`Jenkinsfile`. To make things even better, there are
link:https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo/[official MongoDB docker images] readily
available on DockerHub!

This feature requires that the machine has a running Docker daemon which is
accessible to the user running the Jenkins agent. After that, running a
container in the background is easy, for example:

[source, groovy]
----
node('census && docker') {
    /* .. */

    /* Run MongoDB in the background, mapping its port 27017 to our host's port
     * 27017 so our script can talk to it, then execute our Groovy script with
     * tools from our `customEnv`
     */
    docker.image('mongo:2').withRun('-p 27017:27017') { container ->
        withEnv(customEnv) {
            sh "groovy parseUsage.groovy --logs ${usagestats_dir} --output ${census_dir} --incremental"
        }
    }

    /* .. */
}
----


The beauty, to me, of this example is that you can pass a
link:http://www.groovy-lang.org/Closures[closure] to `withRun` which will
execute _while_ the container is running. When the closure is finished executin,
just the `sh` step in this case, the container is destroyed.



With that system requirement satisfied, the rest of the stages of the Pipeline
fell into place. We now have a single source of truth, the
link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/infra-statistics/blob/master/Jenkinsfile[Jenkinsfile],
for the sequence of dependent tasks which need to be executed, accounting for
variations in systems requirements, and it actually generates
link:http://stats.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins-stats/svg/svgs.html[those pretty
blue charts]!


Of course, a nice added bonus is the beautiful visualization of our
link:https://ci.jenkins.io/job/Infrastructure/job/statistics/[new Pipeline]!
