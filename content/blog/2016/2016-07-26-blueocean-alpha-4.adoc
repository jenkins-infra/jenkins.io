*How to use the experimental update center*

It is a mechanism for the
Jenkins developer community to share early previews of new plugins with
the broader user community. Plugins in this update center are
experimental and we strongly advise not running them on production or
Jenkins systems that you rely on for your work.

That means any plugin in this update center could eat your Jenkins data,
cause slowdowns, degrade security or have their behavior change at no
notice.

You can learn how to

the experimental update center on this post].

Stay tuned for more updates!
