This year's link:https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsworld/home[Jenkins World] conference
was a huge milestone for the Jenkins project - the first global event for the Jenkins community.
It brought users and contributors together to exchange ideas on the current state
of the project, celebrate accomplishments of the past year, and look ahead at all the exiting enhancements
coming down the pipe(line).

=== Contributor Summit
To kick off Jenkins World, we had a full day "Contributor Summit".
Jenkins is a distributed project with contributors from all over the globe.
Conferences like this are perfect time to get contributors together face-to-face,
to talk through current issues and upcoming plans for the the project.
Some key topics discussed during this summit were:

* *Infrastructure* - In the past year, the Jenkins project has moved new domain name,
a statically generated website, and has entered a
link:/blog/2016/05/18/announcing-azure-partnership[partnership with Microsoft]
to host to host infrastructure on Azure.
* *Events* - A year ago, there were five
link:/projects/jam/[Jenkins Area Meetups], today there are 37 around the
world, with ~7000 members.
* *Security* - Daniel Beck has done a great job a "Security Officer" for the project over the last year.
Jenkins 2 includes tighter security out of the box, 9 security alerts have been addressed, and the
link:/security/[Security Team] is continuing to evaluate threats as they are reported.
* *Pipeline* - Pipeline has been a success and there many improvements on the way, including better
Pipeline Library support, a UI-based Pipeline Editor, and Declarative Pipeline syntax.
* *Blue Ocean* - Blue Ocean announced their "1.0 Beta" release and discussed their roadmap.
* *Storage Pluggability* - One of the big upcoming goals is reducing Jenkins'
dependence on local file system storage on the server system
(job configuration, build logs, etc.).  There was extensive
discussion of how to accomplish this goal.

=== What's Next?
Overall, Jenkins World was a very enjoyable event. I'm sure everyone came away having
learned a lot and made many new connections.  I know I'm excited to see
what the coming year brings for Jenkins and the Jenkins community.

Don't forget that there are many ways to continue
to build connections to the rest of the Jenkins community throughout the year, such as the
link:https://www.meetup.com/Jenkins-online-meetup/[Jenkins Online Meetup] which
hosts online events year-round.  Or, see if there is a
link:https://www.meetup.com/pro/jenkins/[Jenkins Area Meetup (JAM)] near you.  If
there isn't, take a look at the
link:/projects/jam/[Jenkins Area Meetup page] to see about starting one.

Thanks, and I hope to see you all and Jenkins World 2017!
