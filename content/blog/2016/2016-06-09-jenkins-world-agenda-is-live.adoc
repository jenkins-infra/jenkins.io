Join us in Santa Clara, CA on September 13-15, 2016!

We are excited to announce the https://www.cloudbees.com/juc/agenda[Jenkins World agenda] is now live. There will be 50+ sessions, keynotes, training, certifications and workshops. Here are a few highlights of what you can expect:

=== High level topics 
* Continuous delivery
* DevOps
* Microservices architectures
* Testing
* Automation tools
* Plugin development
* Pipeline
* Best practices
* And much more

Additionally, Jenkins World offers great opportunities for hands-on learning, exploring and networking:

=== Prepare for Jenkins Certification 
The objective of this session is to help you assess your level of readiness for the certification exam - either the Certified Jenkins Engineer (CJE/open source) certification or the Certified CloudBees Jenkins Platform Engineer (CCJPE/CloudBees-specific) certification. After an overview about the certification program, a Jenkins expert from CloudBees will walk you through the various sections of the exam, highlighting the important things to master ahead of time, not only from a pure knowledge perspective but also in terms of practical experience. This will be an interactive session.

=== Plugin Development Workshop
Due to its popularity in previous years, we are bringing back the plugin development workshop. This workshop will introduce developers to the Jenkins plugin ecosystem and terminology. The goal is to provide a cursory overview of the resources available to Jenkins plugin developers. Armed with this information, Jenkins developers can learn how to navigate the project and codebase to find answers to their questions.

=== Birds of a Feather Sessions
BoFs, as they are usually known, will be a new addition to Jenkins World this year. Sessions will be curated on various technical topics from DevOps to how enterprises are integrating Jenkins in their environment. Discussions will be lead by the industry’s brightest minds who have an influence in shaping the future of Jenkins.

=== Ask the Experts
Got a Jenkins question that’s been keeping you up at night? Need to bounce off ideas? Or you just need someone to fix your Jenkins issue? This is your chance to get connected with the Jenkins Experts. Experts will be on hand to help with all your Jenkins needs on Sept 14th & 15th.
