As you probably know, on this year Jenkins projects participates in 
link:https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/[Google Summer of Code 2016]. 
You can find more information about the accepted projects link:/projects/gsoc/[on the GSoC subproject page] and in the 
link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev[Jenkins Developer] mailing list.

On **this week** GSoC students are going to present their projects as a part of mid-term evaluation, 
which covers one month of community bonding and one month of coding. 

We would like to invite Jenkins developers to attend these meetings. 
There are two additional months of coding ahead for successful students, so any feedback from Jenkins contributors and users will be appreciated.
