When the link:http://rubyonrails.org[Ruby on Rails] framework debuted it
changed the industry in two noteworthy ways: it created a trend of opinionated web
application frameworks (link:https://www.djangoproject.com/[Django],
link:https://playframework.com/[Play], link:https://grails.org/[Grails]) and it
also _strongly_ encouraged thousands of developers to embrace test-driven
development along with many other modern best practices (source control, dependency
management, etc). Because Ruby, the language underneath Rails, is interpreted
instead of compiled there isn't a "build" per se but rather tens, if not
hundreds, of tests, linters and scans which are run to ensure the application's
quality. With the rise in popularity of Rails, the popularity of application
hosting services with easy-to-use deployment tools like link:http://heroku.com[Heroku] or
link:http://engineyard.com[Engine Yard] rose too.

This combination of good *test coverage* and easily *automated deployments*
makes Rails easy to continuously deliver with Jenkins. In this post we'll cover
testing non-trivial Rails applications with link:/doc/pipeline[Jenkins
Pipeline] and, as an added bonus, we will add security scanning via
link:http://brakemanscanner.org[Brakeman] and the
link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Brakeman+Plugin[Brakeman
plugin].

For this demonstration, I used link:http://rubycentral.org/[Ruby Central]'s
link:https://github.com/rubycentral/cfp-app[cfp-app]:

A Ruby on Rails application that lets you manage your conference's call for
proposal (CFP), program and schedule. It was written by Ruby Central to run the
CFPs for RailsConf and RubyConf.

I chose this Rails app, not only because it's a sizable application with lots
of tests, but it's actually the application we used to collect talk proposals
for the "link:https://www.cloudbees.com/juc/agenda[Community Tracks]" at this
year's link:http://jenkinsworld.com[Jenkins World]. For the most part,
cfp-app is a standard Rails application. It uses
link:https://www.postgresql.org/[PostgreSQL] for its database,
link:http://rspec.info[RSpec] for its tests and
link:http://ruby-lang.org[Ruby 2.3.x] as its runtime.

=== Preparing the app

For _most_ Rails applications there are few, if any, changes needed to enable
continuous delivery with Jenkins. In the case of
link:https://github.com/rubycentral/cfp-app[cfp-app], I added two gems to get
the most optimal integration into Jenkins:

. link:https://github.com/ci-reporter/ci_reporter[ci_reporter], for test report
integration
. link:https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman[brakeman], for security scanning.

Adding these was simple, I just needed to update the `Gemfile` and the
`Rakefile` in the root of the repository to contain:


.Gemfile
[source, ruby]
----
# .. snip ..
group :test do
  # RSpec, etc
  gem 'ci_reporter'
  gem 'ci_reporter_rspec'
  gem "brakeman", :require => false
end
----

.Rakefile
[source, ruby]
----
# .. snip ..
require 'ci/reporter/rake/rspec'
# Make sure we setup ci_reporter before executing our RSpec examples
task :spec => 'ci:setup:rspec'
----


=== Preparing Jenkins

[[plugins]]

With the cfp-app project set up, next on the list is to ensure that Jenkins itself
is ready. Generally I suggest running the link:/changelog-stable[latest LTS] of
Jenkins; for this demonstration I used Jenkins 2.7.1 with the following
plugins:

* link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Plugin[Pipeline plugin]
* link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Brakeman+Plugin[Brakeman plugin]
* link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/CloudBees+Docker+Pipeline+Plugin[CloudBees
  Docker Pipeline plugin]

I also used the
link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/GitHub+Organization+Folder+Plugin[GitHub
Organization Folder plugin] to automatically create pipeline items in my
Jenkins instance; that isn't required for the demo, but it's pretty cool to see
repositories and branches with a `Jenkinsfile` automatically show up in
Jenkins, so I recommend it!


In addition to the <<plugins, plugins>> listed above, I also needed at least _one_
Jenkins agent with the link:https://docker.io[Docker] daemon installed and
running on it. I label these agents with "docker" to make it easier to assign
Docker-based workloads to them in the future.

Any Linux-based machine with Docker installed will work, in my case I was
provisioning on-demand agents with the
link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Azure+Slave+plugin[Azure
plugin] which, like the
link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Amazon+EC2+Plugin[EC2 plugin],
helps keep my test costs down.

Fleet plugin] for working with EC2 Spot Fleets.

=== Writing the Pipeline

To make sense of the various things that the `Jenkinsfile` needs to do, I find
it easier to start by simply defining the stages of my pipeline. This helps me
think of, in broad terms, what order of operations my pipeline should have.
For example:

[source, groovy]
----
/* Assign our work to an agent labelled 'docker' */
node('docker') {
    stage 'Prepare Container'
    stage 'Install Gems'
    stage 'Prepare Database'
    stage 'Invoke Rake'
    stage 'Security scan'
    stage 'Deploy'
}
----

As mentioned previously, this `Jenkinsfile` is going to rely heavily on the
link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/CloudBees+Docker+Pipeline+Plugin[CloudBees
Docker Pipeline plugin]. The plugin provides two very important features:

. Ability to execute steps _inside_ of a running Docker container
. Ability to run a container in the "background."


Like most Rails applications, one can effectively test the application with two
commands: `bundle install` followed by `bundle exec rake`. I already had some
Docker images prepared with link:http://rvm.io[RVM] and Ruby 2.3.0 installed,
which ensures a common and consistent starting point:

[source,groovy]
----
node('docker') {
    // .. 'stage' steps removed
    docker.image('rtyler/rvm:2.3.0').inside { // <1>
        rvm 'bundle install' // <2>
        rvm 'bundle exec rake'
    } // <3>
}
----
<1> Run the named container. The `inside` method can take optional additional flags for the `docker run` command.
<2> Execute our shell commands using our tiny `sh` step wrapper
link:https://github.com/rtyler/cfp-app/blob/aff11d97b460ca4b630b1fa4f669c226aeadd8ae/Jenkinsfile#L86-L91[`rvm`]. This ensures that the shell code is executed in the correct RVM environment.
<3> When the closure completes, the container will be destroyed.



Unfortunately, with this application, the `bundle exec rake` command will fail
if PostgreSQL isn't available when the process starts. This is where the
_second_ important feature of the CloudBees Docker Pipeline plugin comes
into effect: the ability to run a container in the "background."

[source, groovy]
----
node('docker') {
    // .. 'stage' steps removed
    /* Pull the latest `postgres` container and run it in the background */
    docker.image('postgres').withRun { container -> // <1>
        echo "PostgreSQL running in container ${container.id}" // <2>
    } // <3>
}
----
<1> Run the container, effectively `docker run postgres`
<2> Any number of steps can go inside the closure
<3> When the closure completes, the container will be destroyed.


==== Running the tests

Combining these two snippets of Jenkins Pipeline is, in my opinion, where the
power of the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language[DSL]
shines:

[source,groovy]
----
node('docker') {
    docker.image('postgres').withRun { container ->
        docker.image('rtyler/rvm:2.3.0').inside("--link=${container.id}:postgres") { // <1>
            stage 'Install Gems'
            rvm "bundle install"

            stage 'Invoke Rake'
            withEnv(['DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres@postgres:5432/']) { // <2>
                rvm "bundle exec rake"
            }
            junit 'spec/reports/*.xml' // <3>
        }
    }
}
----
<1> By passing the `--link` argument, the Docker daemon will allow the RVM container to talk to the PostgreSQL container under the host name 'postgres'.
<2> Use the `withEnv` step to set environment variables for everything that is in the closure. In this case, the cfp-app DB scaffolding will look for the `DATABASE_URL` variable to override the DB host/user/dbname defaults.
<3> Archive the test reports generated by link:https://github.com/ci-reporter/ci_reporter[ci_reporter] so that Jenkins can display test reports and trend analysis.


image::/images/post-images/ruby-pipeline-2016/cfpapp-tests.png[role=center]

With this done, the basics are in place to consistently run the tests for
cfp-app in fresh Docker containers for each execution of the pipeline.



=== Security scanning

Using link:http://brakemanscanner.org[Brakeman], the security scanner for Ruby
on Rails, is almost trivially easy inside of Jenkins Pipeline, thanks to the
link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Brakeman+Plugin[Brakeman
plugin] which implements the `publishBrakeman` step.

Building off our example above, we can implement the "Security scan" stage:

[source,groovy]
----
node('docker') {
    /* --8<--8<-- snipsnip --8<--8<-- */
    stage 'Security scan'
    rvm 'brakeman -o brakeman-output.tabs --no-progress --separate-models' // <1>
    publishBrakeman 'brakeman-output.tabs' // <2>
    /* --8<--8<-- snipsnip --8<--8<-- */
}
----
<1> Run the link:http://brakemanscanner.org[Brakeman] security scanner for Rails and store the output for later in `brakeman-output.tabs`
<2> Archive the reports generated by Brakeman so that Jenkins can display detailed reports with trend analysis.


image::/images/post-images/ruby-pipeline-2016/cfpapp-brakeman.png[role=center]


[CAUTION]
--
As of this writing, there is work in progress
(link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31202[JENKINS-31202]) to
render trend graphs from plugins like Brakeman on a pipeline project's main
page.
--

=== Deploying the good stuff


Once the tests and security scanning are all working properly, we can start to
set up the deployment stage. Jenkins Pipeline provides the variable
`currentBuild` which we can use to determine whether our pipeline has been
successful thus far or not. This allows us to add the logic to only deploy when
everything is passing, as we would expect:

[source,groovy]
----
node('docker') {
    /* --8<--8<-- snipsnip --8<--8<-- */
    stage 'Deploy'
    if (currentBuild.result == 'SUCCESS') { // <1>
        sh './deploy.sh' // <2>
    }
    else {
        mail subject: "Something is wrong with ${env.JOB_NAME} ${env.BUILD_ID}",
                  to: 'nobody@example.com',
                body: 'You should fix it'
    }
    /* --8<--8<-- snipsnip --8<--8<-- */
}
----
<1> `currentBuild` has the `result` property which would be `'SUCCESS'`, `'FAILED'`, `'UNSTABLE'`, `'ABORTED'`
<2> Only if `currentBuild.result` is successful should we bother invoking our deployment script (e.g. `git push heroku master`)


=== Wrap up


I have gratuitously commented the full
link:https://github.com/rtyler/cfp-app/blob/0e85db6d054deefd637de235766468631f551c7f/Jenkinsfile[Jenkinsfile]
which I hope is a useful summation of the work outlined above. Having worked
on a number of Rails applications in the past, the consistency provided by
Docker and Jenkins Pipeline above would have definitely improved those
projects' delivery times. There is still room for improvement however, which
is left as an exercise for the reader. Such as: preparing new containers with
all their
link:https://github.com/rtyler/cfp-app/blob/0e85db6d054deefd637de235766468631f551c7f/Jenkinsfile#L36-L46[dependencies
built-in] instead of installing them at run-time. Or utilizing the `parallel`
step for executing RSpec across multiple Jenkins agents simultaneously.


The beautiful thing about defining your continuous delivery, and continuous
security, pipeline in code is that you can continue to iterate on it!
