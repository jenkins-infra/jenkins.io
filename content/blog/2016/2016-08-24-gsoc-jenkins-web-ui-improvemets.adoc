Hello! In this post I would like to quickly describe the work done during GSoC in Web UI improvements project.

You can see all links to pull requests and repositories on GitHub on my https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/nh5J8htwRmc[Work Submission post] in jenkins-dev mailing list.

In general the changes may be separated in two categories: changes in core and help editor plugin.

=== Changes in core
* https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/2388[New Job Creation Popup]

This change allows users to interact with Jenkins faster, since new job creation does not require going to a separate page.

* https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/2388[New Job Creation Popup]

This change also save users' time allowing to see validation errors before clickling away.

=== Help Editor Plugin
* https://github.com/jenkinsci/help-editor-plugin/[Here is the page of Help Editor Plugin on GitHub with documentation]

This is a separate plugin that allows users to edit help information on job configuration pages to have additional custom help information.

=== Future Work

While all three changes are functional and were improved after interactions with mentors, there are areas of improvement.

The popup window pull request uses a remodal library which could be replaced for a more suitable one.

The Help Editor Plugin has a number of possible code improvements, which would allow it to work faster and more reliably.
