=== About me

My name is Samat Davletshin and I am from HSE University from Moscow, Russia. I
interned at Intel and Yandex, and cofounded https://expfood.ru/[a startup
project] where I personally developed front-end and back-end of the website.

I am excited to participate in GSoC with Jenkins this summer as a chanсe to make
a positive change for thousands of users as well as to learn from great mentors.

=== Abstract

Although powerful, Jenkins new job creation and configuration process may be non
obvious and time consuming. This can be improved by making UI more intuitive,
concise, and functional. I plan to achieve this by creating a simpler new job
creation, configuration process focused on essential elements, and embedding new
functionality.

My mentors are https://github.com/lanwen[Kirill Merkushev] and
https://github.com/michaelneale[Michael Neale]

=== Deliverables

==== New job creation

*New job name validation*

Initially, job validation was unresponsive, job creation was still allowed with
an invalid name, and some allowed characters even crashed Jenkins. Happily, two
of this problems were fixed in recent improvements and I plan add only a real
time name check for invalid characters.

*Popup window*

Jenkins has a lot of windows reloads that may time consuming. The creation of
new job is a simple process requiring only job name and job type. This way UI
may be improved by reducing page reloads and putting new job creation interface
in a dialog window. Such popup would likely consist of three steps of
implementation: rendering a dialog window, receiving JSON with job types,
sending a POST request to create the job.

==== Configuration page

*Changing help information*

As reported by some users, it would be useful to have the functionality to
change help information. Installation administrators would be able to change the
help info and choose editing rights for other users. That would likely require a
creation of extension points and a plugin using them. I also would like to
include the ability to style the help information using markdown as shown above.

*[Optional] The functionality is extended to creation of crowd sourced "wiki like" documentation*

As in
https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Translation+Assistance+Plugin[localization
plugin] the changes are gathered and applied beyond installation of a particular
user.

*More intuitive configuration page.*

Pursuing to solve https://issue-redirect.jenkins.io/issue/32578[this  issue]

Although there are a lot improvements in new configuration page, there is always
a room for improvements. An advanced job still has a very complicated and hard
to read configuration page. It is still open to discussion, but I may approach
it by better division of configuration parts such as an accordion based
navigation.

==== Home page

*[Optional] Removing "My Views" page*

"My Views" page may unnecessary complicate essential sidepanel navigation. Since
it contains very small functionality, the functions may be moved to the home
page and the whole page may be removed. That may be implemented by adding icons
to "My Views" tabs. Additionally, the standard view creation page can create
either of the types

*[Optional] Reducing number of UI elements*

The home page may contain some UI elements that are not essential and rarely
used. This way elements "enable auto refresh", “edit description”, “icon sizes”,
”legend”, “RSS” may be removed from home page and placed under "Manage Jenkins"
or an upper menu. It is also possible to create new extension points to support
new UI elements through plugins.

==== Credentials store page

*[Optional] Grouping credentials and their domains*

Credentials page has too many reloads and requires many clicks to get to a
required credentials page. That may be improved by removing the last page and
showing credentials under domains.

=== Current progress

By May 25th I learned about the structure and tools of Jenkins and started
working on the first project:

* I started with New Job Name validation first. Luckily, in last updates the
  https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/2324/files[changes of recena] there
  were implemented all of the changes I proposed except real time check on name
  validity. https://goo.gl/3tHDkI[Here I proposed the change] which fixes it by
  sending GET request on keyup event in addition to blur.
* I also made a New Job Popup with using existing interface.

pop-up progress*]

I used https://github.com/VodkaBears/Remodal[Remodal] library for popup and put
there
https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/blob/master/core/src/main/resources/hudson/model/View/newJob.jelly[existing
New Job container]. Surprisingly, it was fully functional right away. On the GIF
you can see that popup receives all job types and then successfully submits the
post form creating a new job. I think that could be a good first step. Further I
can start changing the window itself.
