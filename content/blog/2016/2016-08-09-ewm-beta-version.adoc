This blog post is a continuation of the External Workspace Manager Plugin related posts, starting with
link:/blog/2016/05/23/external-workspace-manager-plugin/[the introductory blog post], and followed by
link:/blog/2016/06/30/ewm-alpha-version/[the alpha version release announcement].

As the title suggests, the beta version of the External Workspace Manager Plugin was launched!
This means that it's available only in the
link:/blog/2013/09/23/experimental-plugins-update-center/[Experimental Plugins Update Center].

[NOTE]
Take care when installing plugins from the Experimental Update Center, since they may change in
backward-incompatible ways.
It's advisable not to use it for Jenkins production environments.

The plugin's repository is on link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/external-workspace-manager-plugin[GitHub].
The complete plugin's documentation can be accessed
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/external-workspace-manager-plugin/blob/master/README.md[here].

=== What's new
Bellow is a summary of the features added so far, since the alpha version.

==== Multiple upstream run selection strategies
It has support for the
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/run-selector-plugin[Run Selector Plugin] (which is still in beta),
so you can provide different run selection strategies when allocating a disk from the upstream job.

Let's suppose that we have an upstream job that clones the repository and builds the project:
```groovy
def extWorkspace = exwsAllocate 'diskpool1'

node ('linux') {
    exws (extWorkspace) {
        checkout scm
        sh 'mvn clean install -DskipTests'
    }
}
```

In the downstream job, we run the tests on a different node, but we reuse the same workspace as the previous job:
```groovy
def run = selectRun 'upstream'
def extWorkspace = exwsAllocate selectedRun: run

node ('test') {
    exws (extWorkspace) {
        sh 'mvn test'
    }
}
```

The `selectRun` in this example selects the last stable build from the upstream job.
But, we can be more explicit, and select a specific build number from the upstream job.
```groovy
def run = selectRun 'upstream',
 selector: [$class: 'SpecificRunSelector', buildNumber: UPSTREAM_BUILD_NUMBER]
def extWorkspace = exwsAllocate selectedRun: run
// ...
```
When the `selectedRun` parameter is given to the `exwsAllocate` step, it will allocate the same workspace that was
used by that run.

The Run Selector Plugin has several run selection strategies that are briefly explained
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/run-selector-plugin/blob/master/README.md[here].

==== Automatic workspace cleanup

Provides an automatic workspace cleanup by integrating the
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/ws-cleanup-plugin[Workspace Cleanup Plugin].
For example, if we need to delete the workspace only if the build has failed, we can do the following:

```groovy
def extWorkspace = exwsAllocate diskPoolId: 'diskpool1'

node ('linux') {
    exws (extWorkspace) {
        try {
            checkout scm
            sh 'mvn clean install'
        } catch (e) {
            currentBuild.result = 'FAILURE'
            throw e
        } finally {
            step ([$class: 'WsCleanup', cleanWhenFailure: false])
        }
    }
}
```

More workspace cleanup examples can be found at this
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/external-workspace-manager-plugin/blob/master/doc/WORKSPACE_CLEANUP.md[link].

==== Custom workspace path

Allows the user to specify a custom workspace path to be used when allocating workspace on the disk.
The plugin offers two alternatives for doing this:

* by defining a global workspace template for each Disk Pool

This can be defined in the Jenkins global config, __External Workspace Definitions__ section.

image:/images/post-images/ewm/global-custom-workspace-path.png[title="Global Custom Workspace Path", role="center"]

* by defining a custom workspace path in the Pipeline script

We can use the Pipeline DSL to compute the workspace path.
Then we pass this path as input parameter to the `exwsAllocate` step.

```groovy
def customPath = "${env.JOB_NAME}/${PULL_REQUEST_NUMBER}/${env.BUILD_NUMBER}"
def extWorkspace = exwsAllocate diskPoolId: 'diskpool1', path: customPath
// ...
```

For more details see the afferent
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/external-workspace-manager-plugin/blob/master/doc/CUSTOM_WORKSPACE_PATH.md[documentation page].

==== Disk Pool restrictions

The plugin comes with Disk Pool restriction strategies.
It does this by using the restriction capabilities provided by the
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/job-restrictions-plugin[Job Restrictions Plugin].

For example, we can restrict a Disk Pool to be allocated only if the Jenkins job in which it's allocated was triggered
by a specific user:

image:/images/post-images/ewm/restriction-by-user.png[title="Disk Pool Restriction By User", role="center"]

Or, we can restrict the Disk Pool to be allocated only for those jobs whose name matches a well defined pattern:

image:/images/post-images/ewm/restriction-by-job-name.png[title="Disk Pool Restriction By Job Name", role="center"]

=== What's next

Currently there is ongoing work for providing flexible disk allocation strategies.
The user will be able to define a default disk allocation strategy in the Jenkins global config.
So for example, we want to select the disk with the most usable space as default allocation strategy:

image:/images/post-images/ewm/global-disk-allocation-strategy.png[title="Global Disk Allocation Strategy", role="center"]

If needed, this allocation strategy may be overridden in the Pipeline code.
Let's suppose that for a specific job, we want to allocate the disk with the highest read speed.
```groovy
def extWorkspace = exwsAllocate diskPoolId: 'diskpool1', strategy: fastestRead()
// ...
```

When this feature is completed, the plugin will enter a final testing phase.
If all goes to plan, a stable version should be released in about two weeks.

If you have any issues in setting up or using the plugin, please feel free to ask me on the plugin's Gitter
link:https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/external-workspace-manager-plugin[chat].
Any feedback is welcome, and you may provide it either on the Gitter chat, or on
link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org[Jira] by using the __external-workspace-manager-plugin__ component.
