Currently it's quite difficult to share and reuse the same workspace between multiple jobs and across nodes.
There are some possible workarounds for achieving this, but each of them has its own drawback,
e.g. stash/unstash pre-made artifacts, Copy Artifacts plugin or advanced job settings.
A viable solution for this problem is the External Workspace Manager plugin, which facilitates workspace share and
reuse across multiple Jenkins jobs and nodes.
It also eliminates the need to copy, archive or move files.
You can learn more about the design and goals of the External Workspace Manager project in
link:/blog/2016/05/23/external-workspace-manager-plugin/[this introductory blog post].

I'd like to announce that an alpha version of the External Manager Plugin has been released!
It's now public available for testing.
To be able to install this plugin, you must follow the steps from the Experimental Plugins Update Center
link:/blog/2013/09/23/experimental-plugins-update-center/[blog post].

[NOTE]
Please be aware that it's not recommended to use the Experimental Update Center in production installations of
Jenkins, since it may break it.
