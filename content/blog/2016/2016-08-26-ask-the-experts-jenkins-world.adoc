Our events officer link:https://github.com/alyssat[Alyssa] has been working for
the past several weeks to organize the "Open Source Hub" at
link:https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsworld/home[Jenkins World 2016]. The Hub
is a location on the expo floor where contributors to the Jenkins project can hang
out, share demos and help Jenkins users via the "Ask the Experts" program. Thus
far we have a great list of experts who have volunteered to help staff the
booth, which includes many frequent contributors, link:/projects/jam[JAM]
organizers and board members.

A few of the friendly folks you will see at Jenkins World are:

I hope that this list isn't exhaustive! If you are an active member of the
Jenkins community and/or a contributor, consider taking part in the "Ask the
Experts" program. It's a great opportunity to bond with other contributors and
talk with fellow users at Jenkins World.


You will be able to find us in the expo hall under the "Open Source Hub" sign;
please stop by at Jenkins World to say hello, pick up stickers and to ask
questions!
