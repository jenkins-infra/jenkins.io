I don't think I have ever met a tools, infrastructure, or operations team that
did not have a ton of work to do. The Jenkins project's
link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra[infrastructure]
"team" is no different; too much work, not enough time. In lieu of hiring more
people, which isn't always an option, I have found heavy automation and
continuous delivery pipelines to be two solutions within reach of the
over-worked infrastructure team.


As a big believer in the concept of "Infrastructure as Code", I have been,
slowly but surely, moving the project's infrastructure from manual tasks to
code, whether implemented in our
link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins-infra[Puppet code-base],
link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/ircbot[Docker containers],
or even as
link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/azure/tree/master/machines[machine specifications]
with
link:https://packer.io[Packer].
The more of our infrastructure that is _code_, the more we can apply continuous
delivery practices to consistently and reliably build, test and deliver our
infrastructure.


This approach integrates nicely with
link:/doc/pipeline[Jenkins Pipeline],
allowing us to also define our continuous delivery pipelines themselves as
code. For example, by sanity-checking our BIND zone files:

[source, groovy]
.Jenkinsfile
----
node('docker') {
    def dockerImage = 'rtyler/jenkins-infra-builder'

    checkout scm
    docker.image(dockerImage).inside {
        sh "/usr/sbin/named-checkzone jenkins-ci.org dist/profile/files/bind/jenkins-ci.org.zone"
        sh "/usr/sbin/named-checkzone jenkins.io dist/profile/files/bind/jenkins.io.zone"
    }
}
----

Or delivering our Docker containers automatically to
link:https://hub.docker.com[Docker Hub]
, with a `Jenkinsfile` such as:

[source, groovy]
.Jenkinsfile
----
node('docker') {
    checkout scm

    /* Get our abbreviated SHA-1 to uniquely identify this build */
    def shortCommit = sh(script: 'git rev-parse HEAD', returnStdout: true).take(6)

    stage 'Build ircbot' {
        withEnv(["JAVA_HOME=${tool 'jdk8'}", "PATH+MVN=${tool 'mvn'}/bin"]) }
            sh 'make bot'
        }
    }

    def whale
    stage 'Build container' {
        whale = docker.build("jenkinsciinfra/ircbot:build${shortCommit}")
    }

    stage 'Deploy container' {
        /* Push to Docker Hub */
        whale.push()
    }
}

In
link:https://www.cloudbees.com/continuous-delivery-infrastructure-jenkins[my talk at Jenkins World]
(September 14th, 3:00 - 3:45pm in Exhibit Hall A-1) I will discuss these
Jenkinsfiles along with some of the strategies, patterns and code used with the
Jenkins project's
link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra[open source]
infrastructure to get the most out of the team's limited time.
