Those of you updating the link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Groovy+Plugin[Pipeline Groovy plugin]
to 2.3 or later will notice a change to the appearance of the configuration form.
The _Snippet Generator_ tool is no longer a checkbox enabled inside the configuration page.
Rather, there is a link _Pipeline Syntax_ which opens a separate page with several options.
(The link appears in the project’s sidebar; Jenkins 2 users will not see the sidebar from the configuration screen,
so as of 2.4 there is also a link beneath the Pipeline definition.)

_Snippet Generator_ continues to be available for learning the available
Pipeline steps and creating sample calls given various configuration options.
The new page also offers clearer links to static reference documentation, online
Pipeline documentation resources, and an IntelliJ IDEA code completion file
(Eclipse support is unfinished).

One motivation for this change
(link:https://issue-redirect.jenkins.io/issue/31831[JENKINS-31831]) was to
give these resources more visual space and more prominence.  But another
consideration was that people using multibranch projects or organization folders
should be able to use _Snippet Generator_ when setting up the project, before
any code is committed.


Those using
link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Multibranch+Plugin[Pipeline
Multibranch plugin] or organization folder plugins should upgrade to 2.4 or
later to see these improvements as well.
