NOTE: This is a guest post by link:https://github.com/bitwiseman[Liam Newman],
Technical Evangelist at link:https://cloudbees.com[CloudBees].

Rather than sitting and watching Jenkins for job status, I want Jenkins to send
notifications when events occur.  There are Jenkins plugins for
link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Slack+Plugin[Slack],
link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/HipChat+Plugin[HipChat],
or even link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Email-ext+plugin[email]
among others.


=== Note: Something is happening!

I think we can all agree getting notified when events occur is preferable to
having to constantly monitor them just in case.  I'm going to continue from
where I left off in my
link:/blog/2016/07/01/html-publisher-plugin/[previous post] with the
link:https://github.com/reiseburo/hermann[hermann] project.  I added a Jenkins
Pipeline with an HTML publisher for code coverage. This week, I'd like to make
Jenkins to notify me when builds start and when they succeed or fail.

=== Setup and Configuration

First, I select targets for my notifications. For this blog post, I'll use sample
targets that I control.  I've created Slack and HipChat organizations called
"bitwiseman", each with one member - me.  And for email I'm running a Ruby SMTP server called
link:https://mailcatcher.me/[mailcatcher], that is perfect for local testing
such as this.  Aside for these concessions, configuration would be much the
same in a non-demo situation.

Next, I install and add server-wide configuration for the
link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Slack+Plugin[Slack],
link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/HipChat+Plugin[HipChat],
and link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Email-ext+plugin[Email-ext]
plugins.  Slack and HipChat use API tokens - both products have integration
points on their side that generate tokens which I copy into my Jenkins
configuration. Mailcatcher SMTP runs locally. I just point Jenkins
at it.

Here's what the Jenkins configuration section for each of these looks like:

=== Original Pipeline

Now I can start adding notification steps. The same as
link:blog/2016/07/01/html-publisher-plugin/[last week], I'll use the
link:blog/2016/05/31/pipeline-snippetizer/[Jenkins Pipeline Snippet Generator]
to explore the step syntax for the notification plugins.

Here's the base pipeline before I start making changes:

[source,groovy]
----
stage 'Build'

node {
  // Checkout
  checkout scm

  // install required bundles
  sh 'bundle install'

  // build and run tests with coverage
  sh 'bundle exec rake build spec'

  // Archive the built artifacts
  archive (includes: 'pkg/*.gem')

  // publish html
  // snippet generator doesn't include "target:"
  // https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-29711.
  publishHTML (target: [
      allowMissing: false,
      alwaysLinkToLastBuild: false,
      keepAll: true,
      reportDir: 'coverage',
      reportFiles: 'index.html',
      reportName: "RCov Report"
    ])
}
----

[NOTE]
====
This pipeline expects to be run from a `Jenkinsfile` in SCM.
To copy and paste it directly into a Jenkins Pipeline job, replace the `checkout scm` step with
`git 'https://github.com/reiseburo/hermann.git'`.
====

=== Job Started Notification

For the first change, I decide to add a "Job Started" notification.  The
snippet generator and then reformatting makes this straightforward:

[source,groovy]
----
node {

  notifyStarted()

  /* ... existing build steps ... */
}

def notifyStarted() {
  // send to Slack
  slackSend (color: '#FFFF00', message: "STARTED: Job '${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]' (${env.BUILD_URL})")

  // send to HipChat
  hipchatSend (color: 'YELLOW', notify: true,
      message: "STARTED: Job '${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]' (${env.BUILD_URL})"
    )

  // send to email
  emailext (
      subject: "STARTED: Job '${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]'",
      body: """<p>STARTED: Job '${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]':</p>
        <p>Check console output at &QUOT;<a href='${env.BUILD_URL}'>${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]</a>&QUOT;</p>""",
      recipientProviders: [[$class: 'DevelopersRecipientProvider']]
    )
}
----

Since Pipeline is a Groovy-based DSL, I can use
link:http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/documentation/index.html#_string_interpolation[string interpolation]
and variables to add exactly the details I want in my notification messages. When
I run this I get the following notifications:

image::/images/post-images/2016-07-15/notify-started-email.png[Started Email Notification, role="center"]

=== Job Successful Notification

The next logical choice is to get notifications when a job succeeds.  I'll
copy and paste based on the `notifyStarted` method for now and do some refactoring
later.

[source,groovy]
----
node {

  notifyStarted()

  /* ... existing build steps ... */

  notifySuccessful()
}

def notifyStarted() { /* .. */ }

def notifySuccessful() {
  slackSend (color: '#00FF00', message: "SUCCESSFUL: Job '${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]' (${env.BUILD_URL})")

  hipchatSend (color: 'GREEN', notify: true,
      message: "SUCCESSFUL: Job '${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]' (${env.BUILD_URL})"
    )

  emailext (
      subject: "SUCCESSFUL: Job '${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]'",
      body: """<p>SUCCESSFUL: Job '${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]':</p>
        <p>Check console output at &QUOT;<a href='${env.BUILD_URL}'>${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]</a>&QUOT;</p>""",
      recipientProviders: [[$class: 'DevelopersRecipientProvider']]
    )
}
----

Again, I get notifications, as expected.  This build is fast enough,
some of them are even on the screen at the same time:

=== Job Failed Notification

Next I want to add failure notification.  Here's where we really start to see the power
and expressiveness of Jenkins pipeline.  A Pipeline is a Groovy script, so as we'd
expect in any Groovy script, we can handle errors using `try-catch` blocks.

[source,groovy]
----
node {
  try {
    notifyStarted()

    /* ... existing build steps ... */

    notifySuccessful()
  } catch (e) {
    currentBuild.result = "FAILED"
    notifyFailed()
    throw e
  }
}

def notifyStarted() { /* .. */ }

def notifySuccessful() { /* .. */ }

def notifyFailed() {
  slackSend (color: '#FF0000', message: "FAILED: Job '${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]' (${env.BUILD_URL})")

  hipchatSend (color: 'RED', notify: true,
      message: "FAILED: Job '${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]' (${env.BUILD_URL})"
    )

  emailext (
      subject: "FAILED: Job '${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]'",
      body: """<p>FAILED: Job '${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]':</p>
        <p>Check console output at &QUOT;<a href='${env.BUILD_URL}'>${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]</a>&QUOT;</p>""",
      recipientProviders: [[$class: 'DevelopersRecipientProvider']]
    )
}

----

=== Code Cleanup

Lastly, now that I have it all working, I'll do some refactoring. I'll unify
all the notifications in one method and move the final success/failure notification
into a `finally` block.

[source,groovy]
----
stage 'Build'

node {
  try {
    notifyBuild('STARTED')

    /* ... existing build steps ... */

  } catch (e) {
    // If there was an exception thrown, the build failed
    currentBuild.result = "FAILED"
    throw e
  } finally {
    // Success or failure, always send notifications
    notifyBuild(currentBuild.result)
  }
}

def notifyBuild(String buildStatus = 'STARTED') {
  // build status of null means successful
  buildStatus =  buildStatus ?: 'SUCCESSFUL'

  // Default values
  def colorName = 'RED'
  def colorCode = '#FF0000'
  def subject = "${buildStatus}: Job '${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]'"
  def summary = "${subject} (${env.BUILD_URL})"
  def details = """<p>STARTED: Job '${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]':</p>
    <p>Check console output at &QUOT;<a href='${env.BUILD_URL}'>${env.JOB_NAME} [${env.BUILD_NUMBER}]</a>&QUOT;</p>"""

  // Override default values based on build status
  if (buildStatus == 'STARTED') {
    color = 'YELLOW'
    colorCode = '#FFFF00'
  } else if (buildStatus == 'SUCCESSFUL') {
    color = 'GREEN'
    colorCode = '#00FF00'
  } else {
    color = 'RED'
    colorCode = '#FF0000'
  }

  // Send notifications
  slackSend (color: colorCode, message: summary)

  hipchatSend (color: color, notify: true, message: summary)

  emailext (
      subject: subject,
      body: details,
      recipientProviders: [[$class: 'DevelopersRecipientProvider']]
    )
}
----


=== You have been notified!
I now get notified twice per build on three different channels.  I'm not sure I
need to get notified this much for such a short build.  However, for a longer
or complex CD pipeline, I might want exactly that.  If needed, I could even
improve this to handle other status strings and call it as needed throughout
my pipeline.
