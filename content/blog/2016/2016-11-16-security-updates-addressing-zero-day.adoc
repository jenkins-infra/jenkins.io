A zero-day vulnerability in Jenkins was published on Friday, November 11.  Last
week
link:/blog/2016/11/12/addressing-remote-vulnerabilities-in-cli[we provided an immediate mitigation]
and today we are releasing updates to Jenkins which fix the vulnerability. We
strongly recommend you update Jenkins to 2.32 (main line) or 2.19.3 (LTS) as
soon as possible.

Today's
link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/SECURITY/Jenkins+Security+Advisory+2016-11-16[security advisory]
contains more information on the exploit, affected versions, and fixed
versions, but in short:

[quote]
____
An unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability allowed attackers to
transfer a serialized Java object to the Jenkins CLI, making Jenkins connect to
an attacker-controlled LDAP server, which in turn can send a serialized payload
leading to code execution, bypassing existing protection mechanisms.
____


Moving forward, the Jenkins security team is revisiting the design of the
Jenkins CLI over the coming weeks to prevent this class of vulnerability in the
future. If you are interested in participating in that discussion, please join
in on the

mailing list.
