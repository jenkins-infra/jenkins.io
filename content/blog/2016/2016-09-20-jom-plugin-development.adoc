In the second part he was talking about creating new views using Jelly and Groovy, and how to add new content to existing views.

Feel that Jenkins UI is a bit old? You are not alone.
In addition to the old stack Jenkins offers a framework for writing UI components in Javascript with help of Node.js.
Tom presented this new engine, which is being used in new Jenkins Web UI components like Jenkins installation wizard.
He also provided several examples from the BlueOcean project he is working on.

*Keywords:*
Node.js,
ReactJS,
