== Meetup #4. IT Global Meetup (July 23, 2016)

In Saint Petersburg there is a regular gathering of local IT communities.
This link:http://piter-united.ru/itgm8/itgm.html[IT Global Meetup] is a full-day event, which provides an opportunity to dozens of communities and hundreds of visitors to meet at a single place.

On July 23rd our local Jenkins community participated in the eight's global meetup.
We conduced 2 talks in main tracks and also had a round table in the evening.

Talks:

* *Oleg Nenashev*, CloudBees, "About Jenkins 2 and future plans"
 ** Oleg provided a top-level overview about changes in Jenkins, 
 shared insights about upgrading to the new Jenkins 2.7.1 LTS and talked about Jenkins plans

After the talks we had a roundtable about Jenkins (~10 Jenkins experts).
Oleg provided an overview of Docker and Configuration-as-Code features available in Jenkins, 
and then we talked about common use-cases in Jenkins installations.
We hope to finally organize a "Jenkins & Docker" meetup at some point.
