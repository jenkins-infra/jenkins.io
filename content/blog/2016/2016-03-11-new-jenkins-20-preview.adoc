We just published the new Jenkins 2.0-alpha-3 preview build.

== What's new?

* **Jenkins is now secure out of the box**:
  Administrators previously had to set up authentication and authorization
  while Jenkins was accessible to anyone on the same network.  Now, Jenkins is
  protected out of the box, so that it is always safe from unauthorized
  access.

* **Plugin selection for setup**:
  We refined the plugin selection on the setup dialog.
  You've always wondered why Jenkins does not install the Git Plugin by default?
  Now it does, along with a number of other plugins popular in the Jenkins community.
  We're also including more plugins complementing the
  link:/solutions/pipeline[Pipeline plugin]:
  The
  link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Stage+View+Plugin[Pipeline
  Stage View] plugin lets you quickly see what's going on in your CD pipeline,
  and the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/github-organization-folder-plugin#github-organization-folder[GitHub
  Organization Folder] will automatically scan your GitHub organization for
  repositories with Pipeline definitions (e.g. `Jenkinsfile`), and set up jobs for those.

* **Redesigned job configuration forms**:
  The job configuration form has been redesigned so its structure is visually
  clear when showing complex configuration forms.  Additionally, the tabs on
  the top of the page show where you are, and can be used to quickly navigate
  between the different sections of the configuration form.
