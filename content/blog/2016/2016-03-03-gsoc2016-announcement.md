We are happy to announce that Jenkins project application has been accepted to
[Google Summer of Code 2016](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) (GSoC). Thanks
to everybody who helped prepare the application and submitted project ideas!

We would like to invite students to join the Jenkins community and work together
on the ongoing [Jenkins 2.0](/2.0) activities and other medium-term projects.

The student projects we are primarily interested in would improve the overall
Jenkins user experience in a number of different aspects. This includes user
interface changes and stability improvements but also major new features such
as [Pipeline as code](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/2.0+Pipeline+as+Code).

The projects we've suggested revolve around all parts of the Jenkins project:
core, plugins, website and our internal automation infrastructure. More details
on what has been suggested can be found [on the
wiki](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Google+Summer+Of+Code+2016#GoogleSummerOfCode2016-Projectideas)
which include:

* Jenkins web interface improvements
* "Update Center 2.0"
* New generation of the fingerprinting engine
* External workspace manager
* Integration of [Docker plugins](/solutions/docker/) with Jenkins 2.0 features
* Plugins for Electronic Design Automation and Embedded tools integration
* Improvements of the [Support](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Support+Core+Plugin) plugin
* Improvements to Jenkins project infrastructure: core infra, website, plugin documentation and more

## If you are a student:

1. Check out the project ideas [here](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Google+Summer+Of+Code+2016#GoogleSummerOfCode2016-Projectideas).
2. Select an interesting project idea or draft your own proposal.
3. If you are not familiar with Jenkins, we highly recommend trying it out with one of your previous projects. You can also try available Jenkins features from the [project ideas](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Google+Summer+Of+Code+2016#GoogleSummerOfCode2016-Projectideas).
4. Introduce yourself the community and start your project proposal discussion (see the guidelines [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5668199471251456/)).
5. Join us at [GSoC office hours](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Google+Summer+Of+Code+2016#GoogleSummerOfCode2016-Forinterestedstudents). We plan to have two meetings starting on March 7th.

## If you want to be a mentor:

* Feel free to team up with other mentors
* We accept extra project proposals from mentors until March 9th.
