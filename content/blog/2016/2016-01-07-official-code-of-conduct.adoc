title: "Jenkins Code of Conduct"
author: rtyler

Over the past couple months, we have been working on a long overdue
link:/project/conduct[Code of Conduct] for the Jenkins project (meeting minutes
link:https://meetings.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins-meeting/2015/jenkins-meeting.2015-12-09-19.01.html[here]
and
link:https://meetings.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins-meeting/2016/jenkins-meeting.2016-01-06-19.01.html[here]).
Following in the footsteps of other projects like the
link:https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html[Apache Software
Foundation], link:https://golang.org/conduct[Go lang] and
link:https://contributor-covenant.org/[countless others], we have adopted this
code of conduct to help set guidelines for what behaviors are acceptable, and
what behaviors are not, when acting within the Jenkins community or on behalf
of the Jenkins project.


I would like to extend our gratitude to the authors of
link:https://contributor-covenant.org/[the Contributor Covenant] who provided us
with a very good and mostly finished Code of Conduct template. We have
link:/project/conduct[adapted the covenant] to meet the unique needs of a multifaceted
project like Jenkins.


The document itself is broken down into three sections, all of which I
encourage you to read:

* The link:/project/conduct#code-of-conduct[code of conduct] itself
* link:/project/conduct#reporting[Instructions on how to report problems]
* link:/project/conduct#handling-of-violations[An outline of how violations will be handled]


Similar to many other process and philisophical documents in the Jenkins
project, the document is not etched in stone and is therefore intended to be
updated. If you're interested in participating in the discussion about this,
and other topics around how the Jenkins project operates, I invite you to the
`#jenkins-community` IRC channel on the link:https://freenode.net[Freenode
network] or to our regularly scheduled
link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Governance+Meeting+Agenda[governance
meetings].
