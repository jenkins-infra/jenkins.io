NOTE: This is a guest post by Jenkins World speaker Andrey Pokhilko, Chief Scientist at link:https://www.blazemeter.com/[Blazemeter].

Companies who want to speed things up, lower costs, improve product quality and be the spearhead of the tech industry are moving towards link:http://info.blazemeter.com/how-to-build-testing-into-continuous-integration-pipeline-webinar[Continuous Integration (CI)] and Continuous Delivery (CD). To ensure that the full quality control process goes through CI, companies should incorporate functional tests and performance tests (after static code analysis, and unit tests) into their practices. Only then deployment should take place.

Some of the challenges CI leaders might encounter include adaption to the test environment, dealing with the length of performance tests, debugging complexity and lack of tools and knowledge to analyze results.

But there are ways to overcome these problems. I will elaborate more in my talk, but one way to deal with time consumption is to parallelize tests on Jenkins 2.0 and maximize knowledge from short tests. link:http://gettaurus.org/[Taurus], an open-source automation tool, can be a solution for debugging, as it easily provides assertions such as pass-fail criteria and resource monitoring.

Jenkins is an ideal tool for developers, QA engineers and DevOps who load test. Jenkins plugins, such as the Plot Plugin that shows response times, the Performance Publisher Plugin that shows performance trends and the link:https://a.blazemeter.com/app/sign-up[BlazeMeter] plugin that shows test results in the Cloud, make testing on Jenkins clear and useful. Taurus works with many of Jenkins plugins.

Iâ€™ll be going through all of this and more at link:https://www.cloudbees.com/performance-testing-continuous-delivery-pipelines[my talk on Thursday, September the 15th, at 11:30, at Great America J]. We will also have live shows at booth #101 and hands-on demos. I hope to see you there.
