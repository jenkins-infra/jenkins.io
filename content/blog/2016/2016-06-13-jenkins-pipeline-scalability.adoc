Implementing a CI/CD solution based on Jenkins has become very easy. Dealing
with hundreds of jobs? Not so much. Having to scale to thousands of jobs?
Now this is a real challenge.

[.lead]
This is the story of a journey to get out of the
jungle of jobs...

==== Start of the journey

At the beginning of the journey there were several projects using roughly the same
technologies. Those projects had several
branches, for maintenance of releases, for new features.

In turn, each of those branches had to be carefully built, deployed on different
platforms and versions, promoted so they could be tested for functionalities,
performances and security, and then promoted again for actual delivery.

Additionally, we had to offer the test teams the means to deploy any version of
their choice on any supported platform in order to carry out some manual tests.

This represented, for each branch, around 20 jobs. Multiply this by the number of
branches and projects, and there you are: more than two years after the start
of the story, we had more than 3500 jobs.

3500 jobs. Half a dozen people to manage them all...

==== Preparing the journey

How did we deal with this load?

We were lucky enough to have several assets:

* time - we had time to design a solution before the scaling went really out of
  control
* forecast - we _knew_ that the scaling would occur and we were not taken by
  surprise
* tooling - the https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Job+DSL+Plugin[Jenkins Job DSL]
  was available, efficient and well documented

We also knew that, in order to scale, we'd have to provide a solution with the
following characteristics:

 * self-service - we could not have a team of 6 people become a bottleneck for
   enabling CI/CD in projects
 * security - the solution had to be secure enough in order for it to be used by
   remote developers we never met and didn't know
 * simplicity - enabling CI/CD had to be simple so that people having
   never heard of it could still use it
 * extensibility - no solution is a one-size-fits-all and must be flexible
   enough to allow for corner cases

NOTE: All the mechanisms described in this article are available through the
https://github.com/jenkinsci/seed-plugin[Jenkins Seed plug-in].

Creating pipelines using the Job DSL and embedding the scripts in the code was
simple enough. But what about branching? We needed a mechanism to allow the
creation of pipelines per branch, by downloading the associated DSL and to
run it in a dedicated folder.

But then, all those projects, all those branches, they were mostly using the
same pipelines, give or take a few configurable items. Going this way would
have lead to a terrible duplication of code, transforming a job maintenance
nightmare into a code maintenance nightmare.

==== Pipeline as configuration

Our trick was to transform this vision of "pipeline as code" into a "pipeline
as configuration":

* by maintaining well documented and tested "pipeline libraries"
* by asking projects to describe their pipeline not as code, but as property
  files which would:
** define the name and version of the DSL pipeline library to use
** use the rest of the property file to configure the pipeline library, using
    as many sensible default values as possible

==== Piloting the pipeline from the SCM

Once this was done, the only remaining trick was to automate the creation,
update, start and deletion of the pipelines using SCM events. By enabling SCM
hooks (in GitHub, BitBucket or even in Subversion), we could:

* automatically create a pipeline for a new branch
* regenerate a pipeline when the branch's pipeline description was modified
* start the pipeline on any other commit on the branch
* remove the pipeline when the branch was deleted

Once a project wants to go in our ecosystem, the Jenkins team "seeds" the
project into Jenkins, by running a job and giving a few parameters.

It will create a folder for the project and grant proper authorisations, using
Active Directory group names based on the project name.

The hook for the project must be registered into the SCM and you're up and
running.

==== Configuration _and_ code

Mixing the use of strong pipeline libraries configured by properties and the
direct use of the Jenkins Job DSL is still possible. The Seed plug-in
supports all kinds of combinations:

* use of pipeline libraries only - this can even be enforced
* use a DSL script which can in turn use some classes and methods defined in
  a pipeline library
* use of a Job DSL script only

Usually, we tried to have a maximum reuse, through only pipeline libraries, for
most of our projects, but in other circumstances, we were less strict and
allowed some teams to develop their own pipeline script.

==== End of the journey

In the end, what did we achieve?

**Self service** ✔︎

* Pipeline automation from SCM - no intervention from the Jenkins team but for
  the initial bootstrapping
* Getting a project on board of this system can be done in a few minutes only

**Security** ✔︎

* Project level authorisations
* No code execution on the master

**Simplicity** ✔︎

 * Property files

**Extensibility** ✔︎

* Pipeline libraries
* Direct job DSL still possible

==== Seed and Pipeline plug-in

Now, what about the https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/[pipeline plug-in]? Both
this plug-in and the Seed plug-in have common functionalities:

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkinsci/seed-plugin/master/doc/blog/seed-now.png[Seed now]

What we have found in our journey is that having a "pipeline as configuration"
was the easiest and most secure way to get a lot of projects on board, with
developers not knowing Jenkins and even less the DSL.

The outcome of the two plug-ins is different:

* one pipeline job for the Pipeline plug-in
* a list of orchestrated jobs for the Seed plug-in

If time allows, it would be probably a good idea to find a way to integrate the
functionalities of the Seed plug-in into the pipeline framework, and to keep
what makes the strength of the Seed plug-in:

* pipeline as configuration
* reuseable pipeline libraries, versioned and tested
