At previous Jenkins User Conferences we have hosted "Contributor Summits" to
gather developers and power-users in one room to discuss specific areas of
Jenkins, such as Scalability, Pipeline, etc. As part of this year's
link:https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsworld/home[Jenkins World] we're hosting
another link:https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/232811529/[Contributor
Summit], to discuss: link:/projects/blueocean[*Blue Ocean*],
link:/doc/pipeline[*Pipeline*] and *Storage Pluggability*.


Contributors to these three areas of the Jenkins ecosystem will be in
attendance to present details of their design, requirements, and tentative
roadmaps. After the presentations, the afternoon will be "unconference style" which
is much more fluid to allow discussions, feedback, and brain-storming around
the three focus areas.

The program for the
link:https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/232811529/[*Jenkins World
Contributor Summit*] includes:

* Updates from the various project
  link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Team+Leads[officers].
* A discussion of the link:/projects/blueocean[Blue Ocean] technology stack,
  overall architecture, and how to develop plugins that integrate with Blue
  Ocean. Led by link:https://github.com/kzantow[Keith Zantow].
* Presentation on the current status of link:/doc/pipeline[Pipeline], lessons
  learned, new changes and the future. Led by
  link:https://github.com/jglick[Jesse Glick].
* Overview of "Storage Pluggability", a new scalability-oriented project to
  revamp the underlying storage mechanisms in Jenkins. Led by
  link:https://github.com/kohsuke[Kohsuke Kawaguchi].


I cannot recommend participating in the Contributor Summit enough. I have found
previous Summits to be immensely useful for sharing my own thoughts, as well as
for hearing new perspectives from the others in attendance.

Our space is limited however! I encourage you to join us, so please
