As I mentioned in my
link:/blog/2016/09/27/jenkins-world-2016-wrap-up-scaling/[previous post],
link:https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsworld/home[Jenkins World] brought together
Jenkins users from organizations of all sizes.  It also brought together Jenkins
users of all skill levels; from beginners to experts (including to link:/projects/jam[JAM]
organizers, board members, and long time contributors).  A number
of those experts also volunteered to staff the Open Source Hub's
"Ask the Experts" desk throughout the conference to answer Jenkins questions.
This included, but was not limited to:

I actually chose to spend the majority of my time at the booth. It was
fantastic to hear all the different ways people are using
Jenkins and wanting use Jenkins to do even more. I answered dozens of questions
on both days of the conference, often learning new things in the process of answering them.
And for questions that were beyond any one person's knowledge, there was such a
breadth of expertise, very few questions were beyond our combined abilities.

While "Ask the Experts" saw a lot traffic, the Open Source Hub's lunch-time demos drew
really big crowds. They covered wide range of subjects in a quick succession and offered people
a chance to be introduced to new areas of in Jenkins without spending a whole session on them.
Some demos were only presented at lunch while others were abbreviated versions of
longer talks presented at other times during the conference.  Here's the full list with related links:
