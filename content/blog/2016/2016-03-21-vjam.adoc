Over the past few months, I'm happy to say, the number of
link:https://www.meetup.com/pro/jenkins[Jenkins Area Meetups] (JAMs) has grown
tremendously! The excitement around JAMs has gotten us thinking about something
larger, something more globally focused. That led us to create
link:https://www.meetup.com/Jenkins-online-meetup/[vJAM], an online Jenkins Area
Meetup, where we can share what we're learning together. The effort will be
spear-headed by long time Jenkins contributor, link:https://github.com/rtyler[R. Tyler Croy].


The key goals for the Virtual Jenkins Area Meetup are:

. Connect the global Jenkins user and developer community.
. Help spread the latest and greatest best practices.
. Support link:https://www.meetup.com/pro/jenkins/[other JAMs] by offering
  another, broader, audience for speakers and organizers



vJAM, originally inspired by link:https://virtualjug.com/[Virtual JUG], will
supplement local JAMs but nothing virtual can replace the value of talking with
other Jenkins users over pizza and drinks.


We're currently working on the agenda for the first vJAM, which will be posted
to link:https://www.meetup.com/Jenkins-online-meetup/[this Meetup group], so be
sure to sign up if you're interested in participating!
