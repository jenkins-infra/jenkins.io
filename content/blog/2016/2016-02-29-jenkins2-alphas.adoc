After first
link:/blog/2015/10/01/upcoming-in-office-hours-jenkins-2-0/[announcing the
Jenkins 2.0 effort] last fall, we are pleased to announce the availability of
the first Jenkins link:/2.0/[2.0 *alpha* builds]. For months we have had builds
available from the link:https://ci.jenkins.io/job/Core/job/jenkins/[jenkins_2.0]
branch of development, but the "alpha" builds mark link:/2.0[Jenkins 2.0] being
officially made available for testing and feedback.

== Jenkins 2.0 Highlights

=== Pipeline as Code

The new link:/solutions/pipeline[Pipeline] functionality in Jenkins allows you
to define configuration as code, which can be checked in and version controlled
along with the rest of your project's source code.

Defining your pipeline's configuration as code makes it easier to create a
simple "build and test" pipeline, while enabling more advanced and complex
pipelines through the expressive Groovy-based domain specific language.

=== Out of the box experience

For new users, Jenkins 2.0 starts off with set of recommended plugins, seen in
the image above,  to help get you started with the right set of tools to get up
and running with Jenkins quickly.

For the more adventurous users, the Jenkins 2.0 initial setup process
also allows you to pick and choose exactly the plugins you want to meet
your specific needs.

=== Totally backwards compatible

Jenkins 2.0 is a drop-in replacement of the Jenkins 1.x series of releases
and fully backward compatible. There will be practically no reason _not_ to
upgrade once 2.0 is released in the next couple of months.
