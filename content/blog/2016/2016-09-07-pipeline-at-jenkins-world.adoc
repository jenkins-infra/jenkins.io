I have been heavily using link:/doc/pipeline[Jenkins Pipeline] for just about
every Jenkins-related project I have contributed to over the past year. Whether I am
building and publishing link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/ircbot[Docker
containers], link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins-infra[testing
infrastructure code] or
link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io[publishing this very web
site], I have been adding a `Jenkinsfile` to nearly every Git repository I
touch.


Implementing Pipeline has been rewarding, but has not been without its own
challenges. That's why I'm excited to see _lots_ of different Jenkins Pipeline
related content in the link:https://www.cloudbees.com/juc/agenda[agenda] at
Jenkins World.


I don't think it's possible for a single person to attend all of the Pipeline
talks, or the Pipeline-related link:/blog/2016/08/30/ask-experts-demos/[demos]
in the "Open Source Hub", but fortunately link:https://cloudbees.com[CloudBees]
will be recording the sessions. If you have Pipeline-related questions unanswered by
all these presentations, feel free to join us at the "Open Source Hub" in the
expo hall and link:/blog/2016/08/26/ask-the-experts-jenkins-world/[Ask the
Experts].

Automated workflow is a proven method for removing process variability. DevOps
pipelines are the next step in the evolution of CI/CD/DevOps. This talk covers
Jenkins pipelines, both with and without AWS integration, and explains how
Jenkins can be used to create, execute and manage pipelines.

Considering a mono repo that can manage all your source code, binary and other
assets? Join us at the Perforce Birds of a Feather Session for updates and
discussions around the Helix Plugin for Jenkins (or ‘P4 plugin’).

image:/images/post-images/pipeline-at-jenkinsworld/perforce.png[role=right]

This session will look at the latest DSL PipeLine support in the ‘P4 plugin’
for Jenkins and will include a live demo. We will show you how to map your
Branches and Streams into a Jenkins Workspace, publish assets back into
Helix, and more. You may even get a sneak preview at the latest ‘P4 plugin’
for Jenkins that allows you the freedom to query and run commands from
within Jenkins directly against your Helix connection.

Many of us have already experimented with Docker - for example, by running one
of the pre-built images from Docker Hub. It is possible that your team might
have recognized the benefits that Docker provides in building microservices and
the advantages the technology could bring to development, testing, integration
and, ultimately, production. However, you must create a comprehensive build
pipeline before deploying any containers into a live environment. Integrating
containers into a CD pipeline is far from easy. Along with the benefits Docker
brings, there are challenges both technically and process-related. This
presentation attempts to outline the steps you need to take for a
fully-automated Jenkins pipeline that continuously builds, tests and deploys
microservices into a Docker Swarm cluster.

Pipeline is as powerful as a loaded gun, but with skill can be as delicate as a
surgeon’s knife. This talk will give an overview of health and safety so that
you can avoid shooting yourself in the head and walk the path to medical
school. It will cover not only what not to do, but also why, and share some
solutions so you are not left high and dry. Both James and Bobby have bullet
wounds from “Champagning” pipeline to automate the test and release of several
of the CloudBees products and can occasionally still be seen walking with a
limp from shooting for the moon and hitting their feet.

While Docker has enabled an unprecedented velocity of software production, it
is all too easy to spin out of control. A promotion-based model is required to
control and track the flow of Docker images as much as it is required for a
traditional software development lifecycle. We will demonstrate how to go from
development to containerization to distribution utilizing binary management
promotion in a framework implemented on Jenkins, using the Pipeline
functionality.

The Pipeline feature has matured and is now included in Jenkins 2.0. During the
time since its release, copious user feedback has been received about missing
features and pain points. Come hear about some things we know should be worked
on - or are already in progress - and bring your suggestions.

In this talk, we’ll show how to use Jenkins Pipeline together with Docker and
Kubernetes to implement a complete end-to-end continuous delivery and
continuous improvement system for microservices and monolithic applications
using open source software. We’ll demonstrate how to easily create new
microservices projects or import existing projects, have them automatically
built, system and integration tested, staged and then deployed. Once deployed,
we will also see how to manage and update applications using continuous
delivery practices along with integrated ChatOps - all completely automated!

Pipeline is quickly establishing itself as the direction that Jenkins jobs are
going, enabling the definition of a complete CD pipeline in a single job;
Pipeline as Code via the “Jenkinsfile”; job durability across master restarts;
and more. I’ll be talking here about the next evolution for Pipeline: a simple,
declarative model to define your Pipelines with no need to write scripts. This
configuration syntax for Pipeline allows you to automatically configure all
stages of your pipeline, the complete build environment, post-build actions,
notifications and more. All while providing syntactic and semantic validation
before the build actually gets going.

Response time is paramount for a CI/CD system. In this session, you will see
how a few best practices in constructing pipelines can yield faster turnaround
times and reduced resource use. We’ll also run through plugins and tools to
analyze and visualize performance, including the Pipeline Stage View plugin. If
time permits, we may briefly discuss some of the computer science theory behind
different aspects of performance.

Our 600-person IT organization has committed to implementing continuous
delivery practices enterprise-wide. This isn’t a single momentous event put in
place overnight. Rather, it’s a strategic journey towards a common goal, and
through which each application will take its own unique path. A seminal
component of our CD journey is the Pipeline plugin and it has become our
standard for CD pipeline orchestration. We will discuss a few of the diverse
paths taken by the application teams at our company and show how the use of the
Pipeline plugin has uniquely enabled continuous delivery for us in a way that
no competing tool can.

Pipeline Multibranch projects come as a natural evolution of pipeline as code:
define your CD pipeline in your source code repository and Jenkins will create
isolated branch and pull requests jobs for it. This talk is about the
integration of the Pipeline Multibranch plugin with Github and Bitbucket as
branch sources.
