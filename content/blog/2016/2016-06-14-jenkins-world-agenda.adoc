Join us in Santa Clara, California on *September 13-15, 2016*!

We are excited to announce the https://www.cloudbees.com/juc/agenda[Jenkins
World agenda] is now live. There will be 50+ sessions, keynotes, training,
certifications and workshops. Here are a few highlights of what you can expect:

=== High level topics

* Continuous delivery
* DevOps
* Microservices architectures
* Testing
* Automation tools
* Plugin development
* Pipeline
* Best practices
* And much more

Additionally, Jenkins World offers great opportunities for hands-on learning,
exploring and networking:

=== Plugin Development Workshop

Due to its popularity in previous years, we are bringing back the plugin
development workshop. This workshop will introduce developers to the Jenkins
plugin ecosystem and terminology. The goal is to provide a cursory overview of
the resources available to Jenkins plugin developers. Armed with this
information, Jenkins developers can learn how to navigate the project and
codebase to find answers to their questions.

=== Birds of a Feather Sessions

BoFs, as they are usually known, will be a new addition to Jenkins World this
year. Sessions will be curated on various technical topics from DevOps to how
enterprises are integrating Jenkins in their environment. Discussions will be
lead by the industry’s brightest minds who have an influence in shaping the
future of Jenkins.

=== Ask the Experts

Got a Jenkins question that’s been keeping you up at night? Need to bounce ideas
off somebody? Or you just need someone to fix your Jenkins issue? This is your chance
to get connected with the Jenkins Experts. Experts will be on hand to help with
all your Jenkins needs on Sept 14th & 15th.

=== Prepare for Jenkins Certification

The objective of this session is to help you assess your level of readiness for
the certification exam - either the Certified Jenkins Engineer (CJE/open source)
certification or the Certified CloudBees Jenkins Platform Engineer
(CCJPE/CloudBees-specific) certification. After an overview about the
certification program, a Jenkins expert from CloudBees will walk you through the
various sections of the exam, highlighting the important things to master ahead
of time, not only from a pure knowledge perspective but also in terms of
practical experience. This will be an interactive session.
