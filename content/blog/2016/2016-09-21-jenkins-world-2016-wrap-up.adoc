=== That's a Wrap!
Any way you look at it, last week's Jenkins World Conference 2016 was a huge success.

In 2011, a few hundred users gathered in San Francisco for the first "Jenkins User Conference".
Over successive years, this grew into several yearly regional Jenkins user conferences.
This year, over 1,300 people came from around the world to "Jenkins World 2016",
the first global event for the Jenkins community.

Over the next week, I'll be posting highlights from the event,
