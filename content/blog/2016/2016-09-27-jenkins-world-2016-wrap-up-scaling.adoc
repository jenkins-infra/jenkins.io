One of the great features of Jenkins is how far it
can scale, not only from a software perspective, but also from an
organizational one.  From a single Jenkins master with one or two agents to a
multiple master with thousands of agents, from a team of only a few people
to a whole company with multiple disparate departments and organizations,
you'll find space where Jenkins is used.

Like any software or organization,
there are common challenges for increasing scale with Jenkins and some common best practices, but
there are also some unique solutions.  A big conference like
link:https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkinsworld/home[Jenkins World] brings users
from all scales together to see how people in other organizations at similar or
greater scale are solving similar problems.


Here's a recap of the some of the sessions on scaling Jenkins,
with links to slides and videos shared by link:http://cloudbees.com[CloudBees]:

They shared ways their team has used Jenkins to automate many of the
administrative tasks related to managing feature code branches,
handling deployments, running tests, and properly configuring their environments.
They also showed code samples and talked about future challenges in their quest

link:https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxfields[Maxfield F Stewart] of
link:http://www.riotgames.com[Riot Games] showed how they built an
integrated Docker solution using Jenkins in
link:https://www.cloudbees.com/thinking-inside-container-continuous-delivery-story[*Thinking Inside the Container: A Continuous Delivery Story]*
He showed how their system allows engineers around the company to
submit Docker images as build environments.
This has let their containerized farm now create over 10,000 containers per week
and handles nearly 1,000 jobs at a rate of about 100 jobs per hour.
And they have done this using readily available, open
source Jenkins plugins. He also talked about how they settled on this design,
lessons learned, best practices, and how to build and scale other similar system.

link:https://www.cloudbees.com/how-do-continuous-delivery-jenkins-pipeline-docker-and-kubernetes[*How to Do Continuous Delivery with Jenkins Pipeline, Docker and Kubernetes*],
presented by
link:https://github.com/jstrachan[James Strachan] of
link:https://www.redhat.com[Red Hat], showed how to use Jenkins Pipeline with
Docker and Kubernetes to implement a complete end-to-end continuous delivery and
continuous improvement system using open source software for both microservices
and monolithic applications. He demonstrated how to
create or import projects, and have them automatically build, run
system and integration tests, stage, and finally deploy. He also showed to
manage and update those deployed applications using continuous
delivery practices.

link:https://github.com/carlossg[Carlos Sanchez] of
link:http://cloudbees.com[CloudBees] discussed
link:https://www.cloudbees.com/scaling-jenkins-docker-swarm-kubernetes-or-mesos[*Scaling Jenkins with Docker: Swarm, Kubernetes or Mesos?*]
He compared various Docker Swarm, Apache Mesos, and Kubernetes in terms of their
ability to dynamically scale in Jenkins by running jobs inside containers.
He also discussed the pros and cons, best practices, level of Jenkins support for each
of these technologies.

link:https://github.com/stephenc[Stephen Connolly] of
link:http://cloudbees.com[CloudBees] asked
"link:https://www.cloudbees.com/so-you-want-build-worlds-biggest-jenkins-cluster[*So, You Want to Build the World's Biggest Jenkins Cluster?*]"
and explained how to do so.  He started with
real world results realized by Jenkins users who have built large clusters.
Next, he showed experiments around scaling some individual sub-components of Jenkins in
isolation to see what challenges have been faced when integrated. Finally,
he arrived at recipes for building Jenkins clusters with different scaling capabilities and
making existing Jenkins clusters more efficient.

link:https://www.linkedin.com/in/aliraza82[Ali Raza] of
link:https://www.splunk.com/[Splunk]
gave a talk in two parts,
link:https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-splunk-and-splunking-jenkins[*Jenkins at Splunk and Splunking Jenkins*]
In the first part, Bill showed how Splunk uses Jenkins to implement their end-to-end CI system.
They discussed features and design goals, challenges they encountered, and how they addressed
these challenges.
In the second part, Ali showed how to use the Jenkins Splunk plugin.  Using plugin, he gathered
test results and Jenkins environment data, and delivered it to a Splunk indexer for analysis and presentation.

Last year, they
link:https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2015/abstracts/us-west/02-01-1600[presented]
their initial investigations and stress testing as they
prepared to deploy a large-scale Jenkins installation at Google. Now, with a
year of real-world use under their belts, they returned to present on how their
expectations held up, what new issues they encountered, how they have addressed those issues, and
the challenges and opportunities they see ahead.
