At Jenkins World on Wednesday 14th of September the Jenkins project was happy to
introduce the beta release of Blue Ocean. Blue Ocean is the new user experience
for Jenkins is built from the ground up to take advantage of Jenkins Pipeline
and has rethought entirely the way that modern developers will use Jenkins.

Blue Ocean is available today via the Jenkins update center for Jenkins users
running 2.7.1 and above.

=== Get the beta

Just search for _BlueOcean beta_ in the plugin manager, install it,
browse to the dashboard then click the _Try BlueOcean UI_ button on the dashboard.

=== Whats included?

link:/blog/2016/05/26/introducing-blue-ocean/[Back in April we open sourced Blue Ocean]
and shared our vision with the community. We're very happy that all the things we showed you then have
shipped in the beta (software projects run *on time*?!).

For a refresher on Blue Ocean, watch this short video:

=== Declarative Pipeline

We heard a lot from the community about the usability of link:/doc/pipeline[Jenkins
Pipeline]. Much of the feedback we received was boiled down to a desire to
*configure* Pipelines rather than *script* them and to make it easy for beginners
to get started with their first Pipeline.

And that is how *Declarative Pipeline* was born. We've introduced a new method whereby
you declare how you want your Pipeline to look rather than using Pipeline Script
 - its configuration rather than code.

Here's a small example of a Declarative Pipeline for nodejs that runs the whole
Pipeline inside a Docker container:
```
pipeline {
  agent docker:'node:6.3'
  stages {
    stage('build') {
      sh 'npm --version'
      sh 'npm install'
    }
    stage ('test') {
      sh 'npm test'
    }
  }
}
```

Docker support in Declarative Pipeline allows you to version your application code,
Jenkins Pipeline configuration and the environment where your pipeline will run,
all in a single repository. It's a crazy powerful combination.

Declarative pipeline also introduces the `postBuild` section that makes it
easy to run things conditionally at the end of your Pipeline without the
complexity of the `try... catch` of Pipeline script.

```
postBuild {
  always {
    sh 'echo "This will always run"'
  }
  success {
    sh 'echo "This will run only if successful"'
  }
  failure {
    sh 'echo "This will run only if failed"'
  }
  unstable {
    sh 'echo "This will run only if the run was marked as unstable"'
  }
  changed {
    sh 'echo "This will run only if the state of the Pipeline has changed"'
    sh 'echo "For example, the Pipeline was previously failing but is now successful"'
    sh 'echo "... or the other way around :)"'
  }
}
```

and there is so much more!

If you have the Blue Ocean beta installed you already have Declarative Pipeline.
While Declarative Pipeline is still alpha at the moment, we do encourage you to
https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-model-definition-plugin/wiki/getting%20started[follow our getting started guide]
 and give us feedback on the link:/content/mailing-lists/[Jenkins Users mailing list].

=== Introducing the Pipeline Editor

The Pipeline Editor is a graphical user interface that gives Jenkins users the
simplest way to get started with creating Pipelines in Jenkins. It will also
save a lot of time for intermediate and advanced Jenkins users as a way to author
Pipelines.

When you build your Pipeline in the Editor and click the save button, the editor
will commit a new *Jenkinsfile* back to your repository in the form of the new
Declarative Pipeline. When you want to edit again, Jenkins will read it from
your repository exactly how you saw it previously.

The Pipeline Editor is work in progress and should arrive in a beta release soon.

=== Thank you
Thanks for reading our news from Jenkins World and be sure to check the blog
for regular updates!

I'd also like to thank our amazing community for their feedback and support
as we change the way software teams around the world use Jenkins. We couldn't
do this without you.
