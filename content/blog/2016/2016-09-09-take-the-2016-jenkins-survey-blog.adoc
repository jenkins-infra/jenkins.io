*Let your voice be heard, take the 2016 Jenkins Survey*

Once again it’s that time of year when CloudBees sponsors the link:https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/jenkins2016[Jenkins Community Survey] to assist the community with gathering objective insights into how jenkins is being used and what users would like to see in the Jenkins project.

As an added incentive to take the survey, CloudBees will enter participants into a drawing for a free pass to Jenkins World 2017 (1st prize) and a $100 Amazon Gift Card (2nd prize). The survey will close at the end of September, so click the link at the end of the blog post to get started!

All participants will be able to access reports summarizing survey results. If you’re curious about what insights your input will provide, see the results of last year’s 2015 survey:

- link:https://jenkins.io/files/State-of-Jenkins-Infographic-2015.pdf[State of Jenkins Infographic (PDF)]

As always, personal information you provide is not used by CloudBees for purposes beyond the survey. Your feedback helps capture a bigger picture of community trends and needs. There are laws that govern prize giveaways and eligibility; Cloudbees has compiled all those fancy link:https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/2016-jenkins-community-survey[terms and conditions here].

Please take the survey and let your voice be heard - it will take less than 10 minutes.
