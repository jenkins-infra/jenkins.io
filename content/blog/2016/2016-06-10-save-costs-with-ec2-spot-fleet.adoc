Earlier this year, we published a https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/lyft/[case study^] on how
https://www.lyft.com/[Lyft^] has used Amazon EC2 Spot instances to save 75% on their continuous delivery
infrastructure costs by simply changing four lines of code. Several other EC2 customers like Mozilla have
also https://web.archive.org/web/20160511040514/https://taras.glek.net/blog/2014/05/09/how-amazon-ec2-got-15x-cheaper-in-6-months/[reduced costs^] of their
continuous integration, deployment and testing pipelines by up to 90% on Spot instances. You can view
the current savings on Spot instances over EC2 On-demand instances using the
https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/bid-advisor/[Spot Bid Advisor^]:

AWS Spot instances are spare EC2 instances that you can bid on. While your Spot instances may be
terminated when EC2’s spare capacity declines, you can automatically replenish these instances and
maintain your target capacity using
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-fleet.html[EC2 Spot fleets^]. As each
instance type and Availability Zone provides an alternative capacity pool, you can select multiple
such pools to launch the lowest priced instances currently available by launching a Spot
fleet on the https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2sp/v1/spot/[Amazon EC2 Spot Requests^] console
or using the AWS CLI/SDK tools.

In this walkthrough, we’ll show you how to configure Jenkins to automatically scale a fleet of Spot
instances up or down depending on the number jobs to be completed.

Request an Amazon EC2 Spot fleet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To get started, login to https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/[Amazon EC2 console^], and click on *Spot Requests*
in the left hand navigation pane. Alternatively, you can directly login to
https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2sp/v1/spot[Amazon EC2 Spot Requests console^]. Then click on the
*Request Spot Instances* button at the top of the dashboard.

In the Spot instance launch wizard, select the *Request & Maintain* option to request a Spot fleet that automatically
provisions the most cost-effective EC2 Spot instances, and replenishes them if interrupted. Enter an initial
target capacity, choose an AMI, and select multiple instance types to automatically provision the lowest priced
instances available.

On the next page, ensure that you have selected a key pair, complete the launch wizard, and note the Spot
fleet request ID.

Amazon EC2 Spot fleet automates finding the lowest priced instances for you, and enables your Jenkins cluster
to maintain the required capacity; so, you don’t need any bidding algorithms to provision the optimal Spot
instances over time.

Configure Jenkins
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Install the Plugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
From the Jenkins dashboard, select *Manage Jenkins*, and then click *Manage Plugins*. On the *Available* tab,
search for and select the _EC2 Fleet Jenkins Plugin_. Then click the *Install* button.

After the plugin installation is completed, select *Manage Jenkins* from the Jenkins dashboard, and
click *Configure System*. In the *Cloud* section, select _Amazon Spot Fleet_ to add a new Cloud.

Configure AWS Credentials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Next, we will configure the AWS and agent node credentials. Click the *Add* button next to AWS Credentials,
select Jenkins, and enter your AWS Access Key, secret, and ID.

Next, click the *Add* button in the Spot fleet launcher to configure your agents with an SSH key.
Select Jenkins, and enter the username and private key (from the key pair you configured in your Spot fleet request)
as shown below.

Confirm that the AWS and SSH credentials you just added are selected. Then choose the region, and the Spot fleet
request ID from the drop-down. You can also enter the maximum idle time before your cluster automatically scales
down, and the maximum cluster size that it can scale up to.

Submit Jobs and View Status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After you have finished the previous step, you can view the *EC2 Fleet Status* in the left hand navigation pane on
the Jenkins dashboard. Now, as you submit more jobs, Jenkins will automatically scale your Spot fleet to add more
nodes. You can view these new nodes executing jobs under the Build Executor Status.
After the jobs are done, if the nodes remain free for the specified idle time (configured in the previous step),
then Jenkins releases the nodes, automatically scaling down your Spot fleet nodes.
