When link:https://github.com/rtyler[I] first started working on the Jenkins
website, then called by a different name, I selected
link:https://drupal.org[Drupal], an extensible content management system, to
get the job done. Like Jenkins itself, Drupal is easy to set up, install
plugins and authoring content is done in a web UI. For the past seven years Drupal
has served us well, but it is time to move on to something better suited for our needs.

The general requirements for something newer were:

. Easy to edit and create content
. Changes to content should be tracked and reviewable
. Any Jenkins contributor should be able to participate
. Support mixed content types


The consensus was that a statically-generated site, with raw content hosted on
GitHub, would meet the majority of the "ease-of-use" type requirements. The
remainder could be addressed depending on the implementation. A couple of years
ago I tried to rebuild the site with static content using
link:https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll[Jekyll], commonly used by
link:https://pages.github.com/[GitHub Pages], but the effort stalled as I ran
into challenges with the mixture of content types we need to manage (stories,
events, pages, people, etc).

Having recently discovered link:http://awestruct.org/[Awestruct], a more
versatile and sophisticated static-site generator that powers sites like
link:https://asciidoctor.org[asciidoctor.org], I ventured down that path.

To make a long story short, over the holiday break I finally pulled the trigger
and switched `jenkins-ci.org` over to the new site. In fact, the page you're
reading *right now* was authored and published via our new
link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io[jenkins static site].

If you look at the bottom left-hand corner of this page
there is a link titled "Improve this page" which will take you directly to
GitHub to edit this post!

We have many more improvements to come for the Jenkins website, which are
link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=1&projectKey=WEBSITE[tracked
in JIRA], but for now I invite members of the Jenkins community to help curate,
correct and create new blog posts and pages for `jenkins-ci.org`!
