=== About myself
My name is Alexandru Somai.
I'm following a major in Software Engineering at the Babes-Bolyai University of Cluj-Napoca, Romania.
I have more than two years hands-on experience working in Software Development.

I enjoy writing code in Java, Groovy and JavaScript.
The technologies and frameworks that I'm most familiar with are: Spring Framework, Spring Security, Hibernate,
JMS, Web Services, JUnit, TestNG, Mockito.
As build tools and continuous integration, I'm using Maven and Jenkins.
I'm a passionate software developer who is always learning, always looking for new challenges.
I want to start contributing to the open source community and Google Summer of Code is a starting point for me.

=== Project summary
Currently, Jenkinsâ€™ build workspace may become very large in size due to the fact that some compilers generate
very large volumes of data.
The existing plugins that share the workspace across builds are able to do this by copying the files from
one workspace to another, process which is inefficient.
A solution is to have a Jenkins plugin that is able to manage and reuse the same workspace between multiple builds.

As part of the link:https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/[Google Summer of Code] 2016 I will be working on
the __External Workspace Manager__ plugin.
My mentors for this project are link:https://github.com/oleg-nenashev[Oleg Nenashev]
and link:https://github.com/martinda[Martin d'Anjou].
This plugin aims to provide an external workspace management system.
It should facilitate workspace share and reuse across multiple Jenkins jobs.
It should eliminate the need to copy, archive or move files.
The plugin will be written for link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Plugin[Pipeline] jobs.

=== Usage

==== Prerequisites
1. Multiple physical disks accessible from Master.
2. The same physical disks must be accessible from Jenkins Nodes (renamed to Agents in Jenkins 2.0).
3. In the Jenkins global configuration, define a disk pool (or many) that will contain the physical disks.
4. In each Node configuration, define the mounting point from the current node to each physical disk.

The following diagram gives you an overview of how an __External Workspace Manager__ configuration may look like:

==== Example one
Let's assume that we have one Jenkins job. In this job, we want to use the same workspace on multiple Jenkins nodes.
Our pipeline code may look like this:

[source,groovy]
----
stage ('Stage 1. Allocate workspace')
def extWorkspace = exwsAllocate id: 'diskpool1'

node ('linux') {
    exws (extWorkspace) {
        stage('Stage 2. Build on the build server')
        git url: '...'
        sh 'mvn clean install'
    }
}

node ('test') {
    exws (extWorkspace) {
        stage('Stage 3. Run tests on a test machine')
        sh 'mvn test'
    }
}
----

Note: The `stage()` steps are optional from the __External Workspace Manager__ plugin perspective.

===== Stage 1. Allocate workspace
The `exwsAllocate` step selects a disk from __diskpool1__
(default behavior: the disk with the most available size).
On that disk, let's say __disk1__, it allocates a directory.
The computed directory path is: `/physicalPathOnDisk/$JOB_NAME/$BUILD_NUMBER`.

For example, Let's assume that the `$JOB_NAME` is __integration__ and the `$BUILD_NUMBER` is __14__.
Then, the resulting path is: `/jenkins-project/disk1/integration/14`.

===== Stage 2. Build on the build server
All the nodes labeled __linux__ must have access to the disks defined in the disk pool.
In the Jenkins Node configurations we have defined the local paths that are the mounting points to each disk.

The `exws` step concatenates the node's local path with the path returned by the `exwsAllocate` step.
In our case, the node labeled __linux__ has its local path to __disk1__ defined as: `/linux-node/disk1/`.
So, the complete workspace path is: `/linux-node/disk1/jenkins-project/disk1/integration/14`.

===== Stage 3. Run tests on a test machine
Further, we want to run our tests on a different node, but we want to reuse the previously created workspace.

In the node labeled __test__ we have defined the local path to __disk1__ as: `/test-node/disk1/`.
By applying the `exws` step, our tests will be able to run in the same workspace as the build.
Therefore, the path is: `/test-node/disk1/jenkins-project/disk1/integration/14`.

==== Example two
Let's assume that we have two Jenkins jobs, one called __upstream__ and the other one called __downstream__.
In the __upstream__ job, we clone the repository and build the project, and in the __downstream__ job we run the tests.
In the __downstream__ job we don't want to clone and re-build the project, we need to use the same
workspace created in the __upstream__ job.
We have to be able to do so without copying the workspace content from one location to another.

The pipeline code in the __upstream__ job is the following:

[source,groovy]
----
stage ('Stage 1. Allocate workspace in the upstream job')
def extWorkspace = exwsAllocate id: 'diskpool1'

node ('linux') {
    exws (extWorkspace) {
        stage('Stage 2. Build in the upstream job')
           git url: '...'
           sh 'mvn clean install'
    }
}
----

And the __downstream__'s pipeline code is:
[source,groovy]
----
stage ('Stage 3. Allocate workspace in the downstream job')
def extWorkspace = exwsAllocate id: 'diskpool1', upstream: 'upstream'

node ('test') {
    exws (extWorkspace) {
        stage('Stage 4. Run tests in the downstream job')
        sh 'mvn test'
    }
}
----

===== Stage 1. Allocate workspace in the upstream job
The functionality is the same as in example one - stage 1.
In our case, the allocated directory on the physical disk is: `/jenkins-project/disk1/upstream/14`.

===== Stage 2. Build in the upstream job
Same functionality as example one - stage 2.
The final workspace path is: `/linux-node/disk1/jenkins-project/disk1/upstream/14`.

===== Stage 3. Allocate workspace in the downstream job
By passing the __upstream__ parameter to the `exwsAllocate` step,
it selects the most recent stable upstream workspace (default behavior).
The workspace path pattern is like this: `/physicalPathOnDisk/$UPSTREAM_NAME/$MOST_RECENT_STABLE_BUILD`.
Let's assume that the last stable build number is __12__, then the resulting path is:
`/jenkins-project/disk1/upstream/12`.

===== Stage 4. Run tests in the downstream job
The `exws` step concatenates the node's local path with the path returned by the `exwsAllocate` step in stage 3.
In this scenario, the complete path for running tests is: `/test-node/disk1/jenkins-project/disk1/upstream/12`.
It will reuse the workspace defined in the upstream job.
