Given that we are nearing end of year and the holiday season is here, November JAM activities shows no sign of slowing down in the local Jenkins community. 

=== Melbourne, Australia JAM
Congratulations to Melbourne JAM leaders,https://www.meetup.com/Melbourne-Jenkins-Area-Meetup/members/192742554/[Raisa]and https://www.meetup.com/Melbourne-Jenkins-Area-Meetup/members/77780422/[Bhuva] for coordinating a fantastic inaugural Melbourne JAM!  The Melbourne Jenkins community had a great turnout and was excited to learn about Blue Ocean, a project that rethinks the user experience of Jenkins, modeling and presenting the process of software delivery by surfacing information that is important to development teams with as few clicks as possible, while still staying true to the extensibility that Jenkins always has had as a core value. Thank you https://github.com/i386[James Dumay] for stopping by to take part in the inauguration.

=== Singapore, Singapore JAM
One of the members  who had several years of experience using Jenkins (since Hudson days in fact) to present some basics on Continuous Integration with GitHub. It was targeted at new members who are starting out with Jenkins. We understand that we cannot always serve advanced topics to cater to the experienced users and neglect the newbies so this session was targeted to help give new users an introduction to Jenkins. It went well with about 15-20 attendees and we hope to run some hands-on workshops in 2017. Some members were looking forward to freebies like stickers and T-shirts too!

=== Moscow, Russia JAM
Moscow JAM leaders,https://twitter.com/tolkv[Kirill Tolkachev] and https://github.com/oleg-nenashev[Oleg Nenashev] led the inaugural meeting with a packed full agenda. Oleg began the meeting w/ an update on Jenkins 2 how his team in Alfa Laboratory- what improvements users can expect and what enhancements are in the works within the Jenkins project. Then Kirill shared how his team in Alfa Laboratory used Jenkins to improve CD/DevOps in their projects (with Jenkins Pipeline, JobDSL and BlueOcean), the problems they experienced and how they fixed them. Then Oleg talked about Jenkins Pipeline internals, main features and recent changes in the ecosystem. It was followed up by a discussion of large-scale Jenkins instances at the after-party. Recording can be found https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTur3n9C14XFbfD2gT3CRcwBwobKOvRHJ[HERE].

=== Milan, Italy JAM
The first meetup was a great opportunity to meet local Jenkins fans to learn and share Jenkins experiences at a local cafe.

=== San Francisco, California JAM
https://github.com/rtyler[R. Tyler Croy] performed a 30 minutes live Pipeline coding demo to a relatively novice audience (though all had used Jenkins). A good amount of questions from the audience  which conveyed an appetite for the content being presented. https://twitter.com/RyanWallner[Ryan Wallner], presenter from ClusterHQ, also gave a demo based around Pipeline talking about ClusterHQ's "Fli" integration with a delivery pipeline.

=== Washington, DC JAM
There was a fantastic 90% showup rate at this month’s meetup - 58 RSVPs and 52 in attendance was pretty impressive. All this may be due to Fannie Mae’s story - the success of how they used Jenkins for CI/CD as part of their DevOps adoption. Afterwards, there was a lot of interests and further discussions taking place. Next month’s host will be Freddie Mac.

=== Seattle, Washington JAM
Long time Jenkins community member and Seattle JAM leader, https://github.com/khaido[Khai Do] showed how OpenStack uses "Jenkins Job Builder" to manage and run thousands of Jenkins jobs per day in their multi-master CI/CD system.  He also compared JJB with other Jenkins "Infrastructure-as-code" technologies - Jenkins Pipeline and Jenkins JobDSL. It was followed by an in-depth Q&A and discussion session.  

=== Dallas Forth Worth, Texas (DFW)JAM
November JAM was the most strongly attended of the year! DFW JAM leader, https://github.com/ericsmalling[Eric Smalling] discussed the benefits of dynamic build slaves and demonstrated various ways to implement them such as the EC2 and Docker Slave plugins. There was a lot of interest and discussion, especially around Docker and the ability it provides to have ephemeral slaves with very little provisioning time. https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzW9GvvtcA5naDRNeXVDOTY0X28/view[See recording].
