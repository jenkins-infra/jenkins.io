This week we released version 0.71 of the
 link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Model+Definition+Plugin[_Pipeline-Model-Defintion_]
 plugin and wanted to crown it as the official Beta version of the Declarative Pipeline syntax. Although it has been
 available in the update center since August, we continue to solidify the syntax. We feel this release is getting very
 close to the final version and should not change much before 1.0. However, it is still a Beta so further tweaks are possible.

== What is Declarative Pipeline?

All the way back at Jenkins World in September, Andrew Bayer presented a
link:https://www.cloudbees.com/introducing-new-way-define-jenkins-pipelines[sneak peak]
of a new syntax for constructing Pipelines. We are calling this new syntax Declarative Pipeline to differentiate it
from the existing Scripted Pipeline syntax that has always been a part of Pipeline.

After listening to many Jenkins users over the last year we felt that, while Scripted Pipeline provides tremendous
 power, flexibility, and extensibility, the learning curve for Scripted Pipeline was steep for users new to either
 Jenkins or Pipeline. Beginning users wanting to take advantage of all the features provided by Pipeline and
 Jenkinsfiles were required to learn Scripted Pipeline or remain limited to the functionality provided by Freestyle jobs.

Declarative Pipeline does not replace Scripted Pipeline but extends Pipeline it with a pre-defined structure to let
 users focus entirely on the `steps` required at each `stage` without needing to worry about scripting every aspect of
 the pipeline. Granular flow-control is extremely powerful and Scripted Pipeline syntax will always be part of Pipeline but it's not for everyone.

Declarative Pipeline enables all users to connect simple, declarative blocks that define build agents (including
 Docker), post build actions, environment settings, credentials and all stages that make up the pipeline. Best of all,
 because this Declarative syntax is part of Pipeline, all build steps and build wrappers available in Plugins or
 loaded from Shared Libraries are also available as `steps` in Declarative.

== Example

Below is an example of a pipeline in Declarative syntax. You can also switch the view to show the same pipeline in Scripted syntax.
 The Declarative syntax has a more straightforward structure that is easier to grok by users not versed in Groovy.

        junit '*/target/surefire-reports/*.xml'
      }

      def myImage = docker.build 'my-environment:snapshot'
      myImage.inside {

      }

    }
    catch (exc) {
      mail to:"me@example.com", subject:"FAILURE: ${currentBuild.fullDisplayName}", body: "Boo, we failed."
    }
    finally {

    }

== How can you help?

. Install the lastest version of the
 link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Model+Definition+Plugin[_Pipeline-Model-Defintion_] plugin.
. Read the documentation:
 link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-model-definition-plugin/wiki/getting%20started[Getting Started] and
 link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-model-definition-plugin/blob/master/SYNTAX.md[Syntax overview].
 (These documents will be incorporated into the Jenkins.io documentation.)
. Convert some of your existing Pipeline scripts into Declarative
. Log any issues or enhancements you have
 link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-40493[here]
 for the syntax, the execution, or the documentation.
. Ask questions. You can send questions to the
 link:mailto:jenkinsci-users@googlegroups.com[users mailing list]
 or visit the #jenkins channel on IRC.

== How will this work with Blue Ocean?

Blue Ocean is all about pipelines in Jenkins. Running pipelines, displaying pipelines, and, soon, creating pipelines.
 As part of Pipeline Blue Ocean will be able to run and display Pipelines written in this new syntax just like any
 other Pipeline works today. However, because Declarative Pipeline includes a pre-defined structure, or model, it is
 now possible to create and edit pipelines with a GUI editor.

Although we plan to launch 1.0 of Declarative Pipeline before Blue Ocean is officially available, we expect to have a
 working Beta of the Editor available to play with. The combination of a simple syntax model and an intuitive editor should make Pipeline creation a breeze.

== Happy Holidays

I hope everyone has a great end of the year and a Happy New Year. With Declarative Pipeline and Blue Ocean we expect great things for Jenkins in 2017!
