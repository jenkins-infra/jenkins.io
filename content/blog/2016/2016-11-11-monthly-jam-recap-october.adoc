October has proven to be a busy month within the Jenkins Area Meetup groups.
Below is a recap of topics discussed at various JAMS in the month of October.

=== Dallas Forth Worth, Texas (DFW) JAM

link:https://github.com/i386[James Dumay]
took time out of his vacation to present Blue Ocean, a project that rethinks
the user experience of Jenkins, modeling and presenting the process of software
delivery by surfacing information that is important to development teams with
as few clicks as possible, while still staying true to the extensibility that
Jenkins always has had as a core value.

=== San Francisco, CA JAM


Andrey Falko from Salesforce shared how he and his Diagnostics team used
Jenkins to deliver software securely and reliably to production within
Salesforce.

This was a meetup with CA Technologies and included
https://github.com/MarkEWaite[Mark Waite], maintainer of the Jenkins git plugin
and a director at CA Technologies in Fort Collins.
https://github.com/rtyler[Tyler] did a great presentation about Jenkins
Pipeline and Blue Ocean and showed off how the community is using Blue Ocean to
build Jenkins.

=== Barcelona, Spain JAM

At this meetup, there were plenty of engaging discussions surrounding the
Jenkins Certification and DevOps 2.1 Toolkit: Continuous Deployment with
Jenkins and Docker Swarm.  Guillem Sola shared his Jenkins certification
experience https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJgG-ZC_vwE[HERE] while Viktor
Farcic presented his thoughts on the aspects of building, testing, deploying,
and monitoring services inside Docker Swarm clusters and Jenkins

October’s meetup was a joint effort with collaboration from Perú JUG, and
Docker Lima. The first talk was an Introduction to
https://github.com/mario21ic/DockerJava[Docker Ecosystem], second was
https://github.com/eddumelendez/javaee7-docker-gradle[Building and Testing Apps with Docker] and
https://github.com/eddumelendez/arquillian-cube-maven-demos[Arquillian Cube]
and the last one was
https://github.com/jenkinsperu/javaee8-mvc#using-jenkins[CI/CD using Docker and Jenkins Pipelines].

We had a full house at the meetup. Now, everyone in the room has a Mr. Jenkins
branded on their laptop :)

Special thanks to https://twitter.com/mario21ic[Mario Inga] and

last meetups.
