Planning is underway for the annual Jenkins User Conference. Conference dates are September 13 - 15, 2016, at the Santa Clara Convention Center in California.  In previous years, Jenkins User Conference has been a multi-city conference. With year after year growth, the Jenkins User Conference has proven that Jenkins is most popular open source automation server.  That being said, Jenkins User Conference will be Jenkins World in 2016. It will be a one city, three days, one global conference.
 
Jenkins World 2016 will bring together key Jenkins contributors, and practitioners from around the globe to unite in one location. The ultimate goal is to provide a platform for discussions, sharing, and hands-on learning for beginners, intermediate to advance users.

This conference like past Jenkins User Conferences, has been sponsored by link:https://www.cloudbees.com[CloudBees] (the premier sponsor), is an essential gathering for any developers interested in automation and automation servers.
