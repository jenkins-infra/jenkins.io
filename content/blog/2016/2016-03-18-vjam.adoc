It's a fact: We live in a virtual world, especially if you are in IT.  In the past few months we experienced the pickup in [Jenkins Area Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/pro/jenkins/) (JAM) groups.  The growth in the number of JAMs established and number of membership justified for something bigger, something more universal. As a result, [vJAM](http://www.meetup.com/Jenkins-online-meetup/) was born. vJAM is an online (virtual) Jenkins Area Meetup group with the purpose to share, educate and inspire to a global audience. This effort will be spearheaded by long time Jenkins contributor, [Tyler_Croy](https://github.com/rtyler).

Key goals of vJAM:
* Global access to connect Jenkins users, and developers without leaving your home or office.
* Access the latest and greatest technical content from community mothership.
* Interact and learn from Jenkins users from around the world.
* Support [local JAMs](http://www.meetup.com/pro/jenkins/) by offering vJAM as a broader outreach to share what's awesome in their local areas.

vJAM will serve as a supplement to the local JAMs and does not replace the value of local JAMs. There is great value in in-person interactions with like minded professionals and we will continue to support such efforts. More importantly, vJAM will not be able to replace discussions over beer after the talks. 

We are currently working on the agenda for the first vJAM. The announcement will be posted [HERE](http://www.meetup.com/Jenkins-online-meetup/), so [sign up](http://www.meetup.com/Jenkins-online-meetup/) if you are not already a member of vJAM. 

Help us make this great! Email (jenkinsci-jam@googlegroups.com) or leave comments below with suggestions for topics, speakers and or ways to make vJAM interactive and of value to the Jenkins community.  Please tweet, RT this blog so we may share this message across the globe.
