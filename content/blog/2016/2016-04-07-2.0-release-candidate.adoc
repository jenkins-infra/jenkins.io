Those who fervently watch the
link:https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-dev[jenkinsci-dev@]
list, like I do, may have caught link:https://github.com/daniel-beck[Daniel
Beck]'s email today which quietly referenced a significant milestone on the
road to link:/2.0/[2.0] which has been reached: the first *2.0 release
candidate* is link:/2.0/[here]!

The release candidate process, in short, is the final stabilization and testing
period before the _final_ release of link:/2.0/[Jenkins 2.0]. If you have the
cycles to help test, please link:/2.0/[download the release candidate] and give
us your feedback as soon as possible!

The release candidate process also means that changes targeting release *after*
2.0 can start landing in the `master` branch, laying the groundwork 2.1 and
beyond.

[quote, Daniel Beck]
____
I pushed the merge to 'master'. So anything targeting 2.1+ can be now proposed
in pull requests to that branch.

Anything happening on '2.0' branch will be limited to critical fixes for the 2.0
release specifically.

Compared to the
link:/blog/2016/03/24/jenkins-2-beta-released/[2.0 beta release], the first
release candidate has a number of fixes for issues discovered in the alpha and beta
process. Most notable perhaps is the stabilization of a system property which
configuration management tools, like Puppet/Chef/Ansible/etc, can use to suppress
the user-friendly Getting Started wizard. Since users of those tools
have alternative means of ensuring security and correctness of their Jenkins
installations, the out-of-the-box experience can be skipped.


Based on our
link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+2.0#Jenkins2.0-RoughTimeline[rough
timeline] this gives us a couple weeks to test the release candidates and get
ready for a big exciting release of 2.0 at the end of April!
