Currently, Jenkinsâ€™ build workspace may become very large in size due to the fact that some compilers
generate very large volumes of data. The existing plugins that share the workspace across builds are able
to do this by copying the files from one workspace to another, process which is inefficient.
A solution is to have a Jenkins plugin that is able to manage and reuse the same workspace between multiple
builds.

As part of the link:https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/[Google Summer of Code] 2016 I will be working on
the External Workspace Manager plugin. This plugin aims to provide an external workspace management system.
It should facilitate workspace share and reuse across multiple Jenkins jobs. It should eliminate the need
to copy, archive or move files. The plugin will be written for
link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Plugin[Pipeline] jobs.

The complete project proposal, along with the design details, features, estimated timeline and some implementation
ideas may be found in this link:https://goo.gl/fq3RAe[Google Doc].
The plugin repository will be public on link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/external-workspace-manager-plugin[GitHub].

A prototype version of the plugin should be available in late June and the releasable version in late August.
I will be presenting demos within the community with the plugin functionality.

If you are interested in this plugin, subscribe to the
link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jenkinsci-dev[Jenkins developers] mailing list where I will be
posting updates from time to time.
