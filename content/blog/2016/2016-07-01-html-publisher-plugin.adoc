Most projects need more that just JUnit result reporting.  Rather than writing a
custom plugin for each type of report, we can use the
link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/HTML+Publisher+Plugin[HTML Publisher Plugin].

=== Let's Make This Quick

I've found a Ruby project,
link:https://github.com/reiseburo/hermann[hermann], I'd like to build using Jenkins Pipeline. I'd
also like to have the code coverage results published with each build job.  I could
write a plugin to publish this data, but I'm in a bit of hurry and
the build already creates an HTML report file using link:https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov[SimpleCov]
when the unit tests run.

=== Simple Build
I'm going to use the
link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/HTML+Publisher+Plugin[HTML Publisher Plugin]
to add the HTML-formatted code coverage report to my builds.  Here's a simple
pipeline for building the link:https://github.com/reiseburo/hermann[hermann]
project.

[source,groovy]
----
stage 'Build'

node {
  // Checkout
  checkout scm

  // install required bundles
  sh 'bundle install'

  // build and run tests with coverage
  sh 'bundle exec rake build spec'

  // Archive the built artifacts
  archive (includes: 'pkg/*.gem')
}
----

[NOTE]
====
This pipeline expects to be run from a `Jenkinsfile` in SCM.
To copy and paste it directly into a Jenkins Pipeline job, replace the `checkout scm` step with
`git 'https://github.com/reiseburo/hermann.git'`.
====

Simple enough, it builds, runs tests, and archives the package.

Now I just need to add the step to publish the code coverage report.
I know that `rake spec` creates an `index.html` file in the `coverage` directory.
I've already installed the
link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/HTML+Publisher+Plugin[HTML Publisher Plugin].
How do I add the HTML publishing step to the pipeline?  The plugin page doesn't
say anything about it.

=== Snippet Generator to the Rescue
Documentation is hard to maintain and easy to miss, even more so in a system
like Jenkins with hundreds of plugins the each potential have one or more
groovy fixtures to add to the Pipeline.  The Pipeline Syntax
link:/blog/2016/05/31/pipeline-snippetizer/["Snippet Generator"] helps users
navigate this jungle by providing a way to generate a code snippet for any step using
provided inputs.

It offers a dynamically generated list of steps, based on the installed plugins.
From that list I select the `publishHTML` step:

'''

'''

Then it shows me a UI similar to the one used in job configuration.  I fill in
the fields, click "generate", and it shows me snippet of groovy generated from
that input.

=== HTML Published
I can use that snippet directly or as a template for further customization.
In this case, I'll just reformat and copy it in at the end of my
pipeline.  (I ran into a link:https://issue-redirect.jenkins.io/issue/29711[minor bug]
in the snippet generated for this plugin step. Typing
error string in my search bar immediately found the bug and a workaround.)

[source,groovy]
----
  /* ...unchanged... */

  // Archive the built artifacts
  archive (includes: 'pkg/*.gem')

  // publish html
  // snippet generator doesn't include "target:"
  // https://issue-redirect.jenkins.io/issue/29711.
  publishHTML (target: [
      allowMissing: false,
      alwaysLinkToLastBuild: false,
      keepAll: true,
      reportDir: 'coverage',
      reportFiles: 'index.html',
      reportName: "RCov Report"
    ])

}
----

When I run this new pipeline I am rewarded with an `RCov Report` link on left side,
which I can follow to show the HTML report.

'''

'''

I even added the `keepAll` setting to let I can also go back an look at reports on old jobs as
more come in.  As I said to to begin with, this is not as slick as what I
could do with a custom plugin, but it is much easier and works with any static
HTML.
