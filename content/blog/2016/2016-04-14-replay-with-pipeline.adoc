For those of you not checking their _Updates_ tab obsessively, Pipeline 1.14 [up
to 2.1 now] was
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin/blob/master/CHANGES.md#114-feb-25-2016[released
a couple of weeks ago] and I wanted to highlight the major feature in this
release: link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-32727[JENKINS-32727],
or _replay_. Some folks writing "Jenkinsfiles" in the field had grumbled that it
was awkward to develop the script incrementally, especially compared to jobs
using inline scripts stored in the Jenkins job configuration: to try a change to
the script, you had to edit `Jenkinsfile` in SCM, commit it (perhaps to a
branch), and then go back to Jenkins to follow the output. Now this is a little
easier. If you have a Pipeline build which did not proceed exactly as you
expected, for reasons having to do with Jenkins itself (say, inability to find &
publish test results, as opposed to test failures you could reproduce locally),
try clicking the **Replay** link in the build’s sidebar. The quickest way to try
this for yourself is to run the
link:https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkinsci/workflow-demo/[stock CD demo] in its
latest release:

[source]
----
$ docker run --rm -p 2222:2222 -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 -p 9418:9418 -ti jenkinsci/workflow-demo:1.14-3
----

When you see link:http://localhost:8080/job/cd/branch/master/1/replay/[the page **Replay
#1**], you are shown two
(Groovy) editor boxes: one for the main
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-aggregator-plugin/blob/master/demo/repo/Jenkinsfile[`Jenkinsfile`], one for a library script
it loaded
(link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-aggregator-plugin/blob/master/demo/repo/servers.groovy[`servers.groovy`], introduced to help demonstrate this feature). You
can make edits to either or both. For example, the original demo allocates a
temporary web application with a random name like
`9c89e9aa-6ca2-431c-a04a-6599e81827ac` for the duration of the functional tests.
Perhaps you wished to prefix the application name with `tmp-` to make it obvious
to anyone encountering the link:http://localhost:8081/[Jetty index page] that these
URLs are transient. So in the second text area, find the line

[source]
----
def id = UUID.randomUUID().toString()
----

and change it to read

[source]
----
def id = "tmp-${UUID.randomUUID()}"
----

then click **Run**. In
link:http://localhost:8080/job/cd/branch/master/2/console[the new build’s log]
you will now see

[source]
----
Replayed #1
----

and later something like

[source]
----
… test -Durl=http://localhost:8081/tmp-812725bb-74c6-41dc-859e-7d9896b938c3/ …
----

with the improved URL format. Like the result? You will want to make it
permanent. So jump to the [second build’s index
page](http://localhost:8080/job/cd/branch/master/2/) where you will see a note
that this build > Replayed #1 (diff) If you
link:http://localhost:8080/job/cd/branch/master/2/replay/diff[click on **diff**] you
will see:

-    def id = UUID.randomUUID().toString()
+    def id = "tmp-${UUID.randomUUID()}"
     deploy id
     try {
         body.call id
----

so you can know exactly what you changed from the last-saved version. In fact if you replay #2 and change `tmp` to `temp` in the loaded script, in the diff view for #3 you will see the diff from the _first_ build, the aggregate diff:

At this point you could touch up the patch to refer to `servers.groovy`
(link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-31838[JENKINS-31838]), `git
apply` it to a clone of your repository, and commit. But why go to the trouble
of editing Groovy in the Jenkins web UI and then manually copying changes back
to your IDE, when you could stay in your preferred development environment from
the start?

Using the `replay-pipeline` CLI command (in this example link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+SSH#JenkinsSSH-JenkinsCLIvsJenkinsSSH[via
SSH])
you can prepare, test, and commit changes to your Pipeline script code without
copying anything to or from a browser. That is all for now. Enjoy!
