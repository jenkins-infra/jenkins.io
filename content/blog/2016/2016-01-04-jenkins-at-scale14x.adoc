For the past few years, a couple members of the Jenkins project have made the
trip to Los Angeles for the
link:https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/14x[Southern California Linux Expo].
Despite the name it's a fairly broad open source technology conference and
since it is hosted prior to link:https://fosdem.org[FOSDEM], it's also a good
conference to get us in the open source mood after the holiday break.

Unlike previous years, when SCaLE was hosted at the LAX Hilton, this year it has
grown and moved to the
link:https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/14x/venue[Pasadena Convention
Center]. There, as with previous years, we'll have a table in the expo hall with link:https://twitter.com/kohsukekawa/status/662718638135181313[plenty of
stickers] and _perhaps_ some other forms of swag available for devotees to
collect.

The expo hall will be open January 23rd and January 24th, and a few Jenkins
contributors will be there to ask questions to, talk about CI/CD and hand out
stickers. 

Additionally, link:https://github.com/rtyler[I] have a presentation on
Saturday, January 23rd titled
"link:https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/14x/presentations/continuous-delivery-infrastructure-jenkins[Continuous
Delivery of Infrastructure with Jenkins]"

.Talk abstract
""
In this talk we will review continuous delivery concepts and put them into
practice by building a continuous delivery pipeline with Jenkins to test, stage
and deploy to infrastructure code to production. Reducing the effort, error
rate and time it takes to deploy a configuration to change to production means
less time fighting fires and more time doing what you want.
""

During the talk I'll be highlighting some of the positive, and negative,
patterns used by the link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra[Jenkins
infrastructure] team to manage, test and deliver the Jenkins project's own
infrastructure. Sort of a followup from my
link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqLGKa4QwA[2014 PuppetConf talk] about
migrating Jenkins infrastructure from masterless
link:https://puppetlabs.com[Puppet] to a
link:https://docs.puppetlabs.com/pe/index.html[Puppet Enterprise] oriented
installation.


If you're in the LA area, we hope to see you for link:https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/14x[SCaLE 14X] in Pasadena!
