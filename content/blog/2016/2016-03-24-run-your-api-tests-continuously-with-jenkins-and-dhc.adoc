NOTE: This is a guest post by link:https://twitter.com/glaforge[Guillaume Laforge].
Well known for his contribution to the link:http://www.groovy-lang.org/[Apache Groovy] project,
Guillaume is also the "Product Ninja and Advocate" of link:https://restlet.com/[Restlet],
a company focusing on Web APIs:
with link:https://restlet.com/products/dhc/[DHC] (an API testing client),
link:https://restlet.com/products/restlet-studio/[Restlet Studio] (an API designer),
link:https://restlet.com/products/apispark/[APISpark] (an API platform in the cloud),
and the link:https://restlet.com/projects/restlet-framework/[Restlet Framework]
open source project for developing APIs.

Modern mobile apps, single-page web sites and applications, are more and more relying on Web APIs,
as the nexus of the interaction between the frontend and the backend services.
Web APIs are also central to third-party integration, when you want to share your services with others,
or when you need to consume existing APIs to build your own solution on top of their shoulders.

With APIs being a key element of your architecture and big picture,
it's obviously important to assess that this API is functioning the way it should, thanks to proper testing.
Your framework of choice, regardless of the technology stack or programming language used,
will hopefully offer some facilities for testing your code,
whether in the form of unit tests, or ideally with integration tests.
But let's have a look at link:https://restlet.com/products/dhc/[DHC],
a handy visual tool, that you can use both manually to craft your tests and assertions,
and that you can adopt in your build and continuous integration pipeline,
thanks to link:http://maven.apache.org/[Maven] and link:https://jenkins.io/[Jenkins].

DHC is a Chrome extension, that you can
link:https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dhc-resthttp-api-client/aejoelaoggembcahagimdiliamlcdmfm[install from the Chrome Web Store],
in your Chrome browser. There's also an link:https://dhc.restlet.com/[online service] available, with some limitations.
For the purpose of this article, we'll use the Chrome extension.

In the main area, you can create your request, define the URL to call, specify the various request headers or params,
chose the method you want to use, and then, you can click the send button to issue the request.

In the left pane, that's where you'll be able to see your request history, create and save your project in the cloud,
or also set context variables.

The latter is important when testing your Web API, as you'll be able to insert variables like for example
`{localhost}` for testing locally on your machine or `{staging}` and `{prod}` to run your tests in different environments.

In the bottom pane, you have access to actual raw HTTP exchange, as well as the assertions pane.

Again, a very important pane to look at! With assertions, you'll be able to ensure that your Web API works as expected.
For instance, you can check the status code of the call, check the payload contains a certain element,
by using JSON Path or XPath to go through the JSON or XML payload respectively.

Beyond assertions, what's also interesting is that you can chain requests together.
A call request can depend on the outcome of a previous request!
For example, in a new request, you could pass a query parameter whose value would be the value of some element
of the JSON payload of a previously executed request.
And by combining assertions, linked requests and context variables together, you can create full-blown test scenarios,
that you can then save in the cloud, but also export as a JSON file.

To export that test scenario, you can click on the little export icon in the bottom left hand corner,
and you'll be able to select exactly what you want to export:

Now things become even more interesting, as we'll proceed to using Maven and Jenkins!
As the saying goes, there's a Maven plugin for that! For running those Web API tests in your build!
Even if your Web API is developed in another technology than Java, you can still create a small Maven build
just for your Web API tests.
And the icing on the cake, when you configure Jenkins to run this build, as the plugin outputs JUnit-friendly test reports,
you'll be able to see the details of your successful and failed tests, just like you would see JUnit's!

Let's sketch your Maven POM:

```xml
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0
                        http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

  <groupId>com.example</groupId>
  <artifactId>my-first-api-test</artifactId>
  <version>1.2.3</version>

  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>com.restlet.dhc</groupId>
        <artifactId>dhc-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>1.1</version>
        <executions>
         <execution>
            <phase>test</phase>
            <goals>
              <goal>test</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
              <file>companies-scenario.json</file>
            </configuration>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>

  <pluginRepositories>
    <pluginRepository>
      <id>restlet-maven</id>
      <name>Restlet public Maven repository Release Repository</name>
      <url>http://maven.restlet.com</url>
    </pluginRepository>
  </pluginRepositories>
</project>
```

Once you've configured your Jenkins server to launch the `test` goal of this Maven project,
you'll be able to see nice test reports for your Web API scenarios!

Next, you can easily run your Web API tests when developers commit changes to the API,
or schedule regular builds with Jenkins to monitor an online Web API.
