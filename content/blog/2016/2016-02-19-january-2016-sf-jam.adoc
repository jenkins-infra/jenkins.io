On January 20, the first San Francisco JAM
link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+Area+Meetup[(Jenkins Area Meetup)]
of the new year was held at link:https://mesosphere.com/[Mesosphere]â€™s offices.
We had two speakers - myself, and Roger Ignazio, an infrastructure automation
engineer at Mesosphere. Around forty people attended and enjoyed the food and
drinks Mesosphere provided for us.
