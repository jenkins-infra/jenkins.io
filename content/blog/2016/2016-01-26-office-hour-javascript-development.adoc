link:https://github.com/tfennelly[Tom Fennelly] will host tomorrow's office hour on JavaScript in Jenkins.
The intended audience for this presentation is core and plugin developers.
In his own words:

____
I believe strongly that we can make meaningful user experience improvements to Jenkins, but it will require having more weapons in our arsenal in terms of how we build plugins etc. This is what we'll be talking about in this week's office hour. It will be a developer-focused session where we'll start off by talking a little about how UI development has traditionally been done in Jenkins, before moving on to some newer patterns and tools that we have been developing over the last few months that let us make use of a wider range of more modern client-side development tools. We'll also dissect and run some sample plugins that show these newer client-side dev tools in action.

As usual, the session will start 11am PST. Links to watch and participate will be posted to the link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Office+Hours[Office Hours wiki page] before it starts.
