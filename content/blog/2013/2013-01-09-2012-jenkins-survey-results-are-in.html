The <a href="https://jenkins-ci.org/node/403">Jenkins survey</a> we’ve been running since <a href="https://jenkins-ci.org/content/come-join-jenkins-user-conference-san-francisco-september-30th">the Jenkins User Conference in San Francisco</a> has concluded. All in all we counted 721 responses --- thanks everyone for voicing their thoughts!<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Naturally, it took a while to tally that many responses, but thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/ProductPrincipl">Lisa</a>, we <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/jenkins-ci/2012-survey.cb">now have the result<a/> in time for the holiday.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
As you can see in <a href="https://stats.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins-stats/svg/total-jenkins.svg">our installation tracking</a>, Jenkins installation base has grown 66% since the last year, so I was naturally very curious if this has affected the area of focus for us the developers.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
However, when <a href="https://pages.cloudbees.com/Jenkins_Survey_2011_JenkinsSurveyDownloadPage.html">compared to the result from the last year</a>, the first thing I notice is the consistency in many metrics. For example, about 83% of people considers Jenkins mission critical this year, and the last year it was 82%. The distribution between beginner/intermediate/expert users are also quite similar.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
But this year, we asked a number of questions that we didn’t ask the last year. One of them is the version control systems that people use. Here, we get 61% Subversion, 50% Git, and everything else is within 10%. So clearly we need to start shipping Git plugin pre-bundled! <br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Another interesting question that we asked is the languages people use. There’s a surprising number of C/C++ projects on Jenkins (and good number of Ruby, PHP, Python, and C#!), which made me feel that we need to hear more from those users about the kind of tool integrations we need to be providing.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
One more gem is that whopping 11% of the respondents said they have written and contributed plugins to the community (that’s 82 people!), and another 9% of the respondents said they wrote one but just not sharing it because it doesn’t make sense (7%), or they couldn’t (2%). That’s about 1 in every 5 respondents writing some plugins, which is amazing, if you ask me.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Another big part of the survey was asking respondents what are important in Jenkins --- is it documentation, quality, UI, etc? But I guess I shouldn’t spoil your fun of actually <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/jenkins-ci/2012-survey.cb">looking at the result</a>, so please go take a look yourself! Also, if you want to tally the numbers yourself, here’s the anonymized raw data.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
I’ll hopefully do a separate post on the efforts we are taking to answer those points raised in the survey in coming days.<br/>
