The last week the Jenkins project has reached a miletone release â€” https://jenkins-ci.org/changelog[Version 1.500]. That's no 1.5 nor 1.5.0. That's the 501st release since its inception, counting all the way up from 1.0, 1.1 to 1.500. +

We'll be celebrating this release in https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/FOSDEM[the upcoming FOSDEM conference] in Brussels, but I wanted to thank everyone for making this great community possible by participating and using it. +

Despite https://jenkins-ci.org/changelog-old.html[all] https://jenkins-ci.org/why[the] https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Governance+Meeting+Agenda[distances] we've thus far come, there are https://www.slideshare.net/kohsuke/jenkins-user-conference-2012-san-francisco[still a lot of work] to be done, both in the core and plugins, so we look forward to keep on keeping on in the coming years. +

So here is to the next 500 release!
