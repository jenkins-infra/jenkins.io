It's been a month now, but I realized that I've never posted a wrap-up post of JUC 2013. So in the spirit of "better later than, never", here it goes. +

First of all, I wanted to thank everyone who came. More than 400 of you came, and another 600 signed up for live streaming of events (and I know some people watched those live streams past midnight in their local time zone!). I did my part in https://bobbickel.blogspot.com/2013/10/kk-jenkins-and-triumph-of-technology.html[signing bobble heads] and answering questions, and I was able to finally put faces to some of the people who I actively interact in the community but never met before. +

I tried to https://www.flickr.com/photos/12508267@N00/sets/72157637144035034/[take as many pictures as I can], and https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.700790069940324.1073741828.150316981654305&type=3[Lisa and Alyssa had posted their pictures as well].

All https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc2013/juc2013-palo-alto-abstracts.cb[the slides are video recordings are available online] if you couldn't join us. +

Alyssa said she's got a lot of feedbacks from folks, and https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Governance+Meeting+Agenda[she's already planning for the next year] — if you are interested in sharing your thoughts on how to better do this next year, we've put it up for the next week's Jenkins project meeting agenda to talk about how to do it. +

Finally, everything in the San Francisco Bay Area is incredibly costly, and events like this was really only made possible by generous sponsors, and we really want to make them happy so that they can help us make this event happen next year as well. So I thought the least I can do is to give them a spotlight and talk about who they are and what they do: +
