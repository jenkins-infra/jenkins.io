I'm going to visit Sao Paulo once again this weekend to attend https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/133598002/[the second annual Jenkins users meet-up]. It's a whole day free event Saturday full of Jenkins goodness.

You'll hear from a number of active Jenkins folks, and I'll be presenting about what CloudBees (where I currently work) has contributed to the Jenkins project, including recent new OSS plugins and some services. I'm also stuffing my suitcase with lots of giveaways, including Jenkins stickers and https://jenkins-ci.org/content/behind-scenes-jenkins-user-conference-palo-alto[popular Jenkins bobble heads]. I don't intend to bring anything back to the U.S.
