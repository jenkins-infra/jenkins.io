The folks at <a href="https://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/">Rebel Labs</a> picked Jenkins as the last installation of their technical report series. It is a beautifully crafted 50 page PDF that covers the overview of the technology. You get to see a bit of details about how ZeroTurnaround uses Jenkins, and it contains a section where I get interviewed by them.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Also, while they failed to mention this in the document, you can <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Developing+with+JRebel">use JRebel when developing Jenkins plugins</a> and it'll reduce the # of times you need to restart the VM. To the extent that you use it to develop open-source Jenkins plugins, you can <a href="https://zeroturnaround.com/software/jrebel/buy/">apply for a free OSS license</a>, too.<br/>
<br/>
