In the hope of streamlining account creation e-mail delivery and mailing list moderations, I have deployed https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework[SPF] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail[DKIM] over the weekend for e-mails coming out of `+@jenkins-ci.org+`, which includes account applications, Confluence, and JIRA. +

I've also used this opportunity to switch back the sender of JIRA notifications to `+noreply@jenkins-ci.org+`. It was originally this way, then changed to `+jenkinsci-no-reply@googlegroups.com+` when someone complained (on what ground I do not remember any more.) +

To the degree that I have tested the setup, it is working correctly, but if you notice anything strange, please let me know.
