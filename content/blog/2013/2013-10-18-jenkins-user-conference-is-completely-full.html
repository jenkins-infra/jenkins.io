<br/>
<p><br/>
Our <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc2013/juc2013-palo-alto.cb">3rd annual Jenkins User Conference in the Bay Area</a> being held next Wednesday in Palo Alto is booked fully to the capacity and we couldn’t be more excited for this event! It’s going to be an amazing day of learning, talking to technology experts, networking with other Jenkins users, seeing cool demos and finding out how you can contribute to the Jenkins open source projects.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
This event is being held at the <a href="https://www.paloaltojcc.org/">Oshman Jewish Community Center</a> and registration begins at 8am.  There will be breakfast and plenty of coffee to get you caffeinated. Welcoming announcement will begin sharply at 9am and the keynote address follows shortly after.  We’re so excited to have <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc2013/juc2013-palo-alto.cb">thirteen sponsors</a> investing in and supporting the Jenkins community in this continuous integration space. <br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
