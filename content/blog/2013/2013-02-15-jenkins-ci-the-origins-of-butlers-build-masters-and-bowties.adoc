The folks at https://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/[Rebel Labs] picked Jenkins as the last installation of their technical report series. It is a beautifully crafted 50 page PDF that covers the overview of the technology. You get to see a bit of details about how ZeroTurnaround uses Jenkins, and it contains a section where I get interviewed by them. +

Also, while they failed to mention this in the document, you can https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Developing+with+JRebel[use JRebel when developing Jenkins plugins] and it'll reduce the # of times you need to restart the VM. To the extent that you use it to develop open-source Jenkins plugins, you can https://zeroturnaround.com/software/jrebel/buy/[apply for a free OSS license], too. +
