https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Git+plugin+2.0+beta+testing[Git plugin] and https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/TFS+plugin+2.0+beta+testing[TFS plugin] are calling for interested parties to try out their 2.0 beta binaries before they get released. +

Git plugin 2.0 contains a major refactoring and UI simplifications, and TFS plugin contains a rewritten polling logic that does not require a workspace. +

If you think you'd benefit from these changes, please head to their respective beta testing page and try out the new bits, while we can still change them.
