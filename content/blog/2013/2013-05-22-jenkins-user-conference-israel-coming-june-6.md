The agenda is up <a href="https://jenkins-uc-israel-2013.eventbrite.com/">here</a>. You’ll find a great list of speakers from Israel, Europe and the US to compliment a plethora of treats. There will be an ice cream break, fruits break, beer break and special chef lunch. And everyone gets a limited-edition JUC Israel t-shirt, designed by the t-shirt-design gurus at JFrog.
