It's been a while we had a hackathon in Germany. Let's get together, get some coding done, and get to know fellow Jenkins developers! The date is June 15th Saturday. +

TNG Technology Consulting, where https://github.com/wolfs[Stefan Wolf] (dependency graph viewer plugin, etc) works, will be hosting us (thanks!) +

We'll try to arrange some themes or agenda, based on who's coming and how many of us will be there. For example, +

* If there are many people who have never done a plugin development, we can do a plugin development tutorial. +
* If we see a concentration of devs in a specific area of Jenkins (say mobile), we can try some focused development in a specific area. +
* If you have things you need from the core to do what you want, this is the chance to get that implemented on the spot! +
* If you want to see a certain development happen in Jenkins but don't know how, please make a pitch to us in the form of presentations (short or long) would be welcome +


Finally, assuming there's interest, we'll head out somewhere for a dinner afterward. +

If you are interested in coming, https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/116074032/[please RSVP at meetup.com] so that we can prepare accordingly.
