This is a guest post from Alyssa Tong, who drives JUC organizations around the world.

If you missed JUC Palo Alto on Oct 23, 2013 the [videos are now available](https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc2013/juc2013-palo-alto-abstracts.cb). 

We are off to planning JUC 2014. It is hard to believe this will be the 4th annual JUC in the Bay Area. The growth in the Jenkins community since the first JUC is astounding. 

Every year we are in search of a larger venue to accommodate the larger crowd. For 2014, the challenge of finding a venue for a capacity of 500+ attendees at a low cost will prove even more daunting. We would love to hear your suggestions for low cost venues (in the Bay Area) so that we may continue to keep entry cost low while providing convenience and the highest level of Jenkins education to attendees. Please send suggestion(s) to [events@lists.jenkins-ci.org](mailto:events@lists.jenkins-ci.org)

We are proud to launch the call for volunteers to join the JUC organizing committee (OC). If you are interested in shaping the 4th edition of this great event, please send email to [events@lists.jenkins-ci.org](mailto:events@lists.jenkins-ci.org)

We encourage you to share this blog within your network in case other people
would be interested in joining the JUC OC or have ideas for a great JUC 2014 location.
