In an effort to address these concerns, the Hudson core team has https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/just-kidding.jpg[announced] a roadmap for *Hudson 2.0*.

In a https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/just-kidding.jpg[message] to the `dev@` mailing list, Kohsuke said of Hudson 2.0:

____
As it stands now Hudson 1.0 is a good proof of concept, it's time to take the lessons learned and build a truly solid enterprise-ready continuous integration server
// break
Some notable points from Kohsuke's announcement with regards to the Hudson 2.0 roadmap, which is expected to ship late Q4 2011, are:
____

* Implementation of `core` in portable C for greater speed and code readability
* Selection of a better license, namely the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTFPL[WTFPL]
* Revamped storage architecture around the https://www.oracle.com/database/standard_edition.html[Oracle 11g Database] to provide more optimal synergy over flat XML files.
* Embedding the Mono, Python, V8 and Lua engines allowing plugins to be written in C#, Python, JavaScript or Lua.
* Adoption of the Hudson https://randomfunnypicture.com/wp2/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/haters-gonna-hate-eagle.jpg[Eagle] as a mascot instead of the butler
* "Social" support will be merged into `core`, integrating Hudson directly with Facebook so you can share test failures with your friends.

Hudson 2.0 is expected to follow in the intrepid footsteps of other major revamps such as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_5[Netscape 5] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl%206[Perl 6] in its ambitiousness and innovation.
