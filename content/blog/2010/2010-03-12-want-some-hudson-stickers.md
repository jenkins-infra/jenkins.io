I'm certain you're thinking to yourself "what does this guy need hundreds of Hudson stickers for?" Fact is, I don't! They're not for me, they're for you!

**I am willing to mail stickers vast distances to you** (*with some conditions*)

<br clear="all"/>
#### Conferences
If you're presenting at a conference or otherwise would like some Hudson stickers to go around, email me with a rough estimate of how many you need. The only condition being that you tell me all about the event and how Hudson was received after the fact (this may involve an interview).

#### User Groups
If you email me requesting some stickers for a user group, I'll need an estimate of how many folks attend meetings. Depending on supplies, I may send you a little more than requested to be shared.

#### Companies
If your company wants some Hudson stickers, I'd be happy to oblige, and of course I always appreciate stickers, pens, branded bouncy balls, etc (see: <a id="aptureLink_R5zxZUYv2n" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotional%20item">swag</a>) in return!

#### People who like stickers
If you're just a fan of Hudson, stickers, or both, I'll still gladly mail you a few stickers with the condition that you take pictures of where the stickers end up (and maybe of your Hudson install) and either email me some cool pictures or post them to <a id="aptureLink_S4ASBrm3CN" href="https://www.crunchbase.com/company/flickr">Flickr</a> (tagged: "[hudsonstickers](https://www.flickr.com/photos/agentdero/tags/hudsonstickers/)")

I will be stuffing envelopes in my free time, so there may be a slight delay. You can email me at `tyler` at `linux` dot `com` requesting stickers, I'll need:
