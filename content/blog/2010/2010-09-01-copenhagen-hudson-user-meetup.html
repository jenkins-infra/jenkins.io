<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Kopenhagen_Innenstadt.JPG/280px-Kopenhagen_Innenstadt.JPG" style="float:right; margin-left:1em">September is turning into a meetup month for the Hudson community. In parallel to <a href="https://hudson-labs.org/content/hudson-javazone-meetup-oslo">the meetup in Oslo</a> and <a href="https://hudson-labs.org/content/pre-javaone-hudson-meetup">the meetup in JavaOne</a>, <a href="https://www.nokia.com/">Nokia</a> and <a href="https://infradna.com/">InfraDNA</a> are hosting a meetup in Copenhagen on September 6th, Monday. Read on for the details.<br/>

<p><br/>
The current tentative plan is to do a short "state of the union / what's new" kind of presentation, then use the rest of the time for open mic Q&amp;A, but if you have other ideas, or better yet if you want to do some talks, please let me know. I think the event will be fun.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
If you plan on coming, please <a href="mailto:event@infradna.com">drop me a note</a>, so that we can get some sense of the attendance.<br/>
