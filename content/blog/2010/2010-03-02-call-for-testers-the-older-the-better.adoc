A couple weeks ago in the link:/content/hudson-1347-released/[post outlining the release of Hudson 1.347] I mentioned that Alan Harder (a.k.a. mindless) had undertaken a deprecation-crusade; that is to say Alan has taken it upon himself to rid Hudson's code-base, particularly in the plugin area, of older code. One of Alan's branches `old-data-monitor` was merged into trunk with `r28147` bringing with it some changes to help migrate older plugin datasets to newer formats.

When I reached out to Alan earlier today on IRC (`#hudson` on the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freenode[Freenode]) about the subject he agreed that polling the community for beta testers would be a good idea; *this is where _you_ come in*. Per Alan's message to the `dev@` mailing list:

____
Visit your "Manage Hudson" screen to see if the notice about old/unreadable data appears. I'll be curious to see which of the old deprecated data structures are actually out there in people's XML files.
____

Instead of waiting for the release candidate to be packaged Wednesday evening, I've gone ahead and published the artifact from https://hudson.glassfish.org/view/Hudson/job/hudson-trunk/4544[build #4544] which can be downloaded here: https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/hudson_build4544.war[hudson.war]

If you have an *old* Hudson installation with, testing this build would be incredibly useful. Alan went on to say:

____
If people find issues with OldDataMonitor, they should file them at https://issues.hudson-ci.org[issues.hudson-ci.org] in "core" component and assign them to "mindless".
____

This change does not mutate any data (or at least it shouldn't) so it should be safe, be on the look out for exceptions in Hudson's log on startup.
