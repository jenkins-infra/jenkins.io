Rush delivery from Hudson HQ! Hudson 1.351 just rolled out with a *very* important regression fix:

* Regression in 1.350 that can delete old build artifacts. (https://n4.nabble.com/Warning-about-Hudson-1-350-Could-delete-your-artifacts-td1593483.html[mailing list thread], https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-5937[issue 5937])

Sorry for the hiccup everybody, we're working pretty hard on getting a better, more stable, release process in place.

You can go grab the http://mirrors.jenkins.io/war-stable/latest/jenkins.war[latest .war file] straight from `hudson-ci.org` or if you're using a native package, use your package manager to upgrade.
