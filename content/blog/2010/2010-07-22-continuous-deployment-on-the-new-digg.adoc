In my capacity as Build Guy at https://digg.com[Digg], I've written up a blog post on our new continuous deployment/code review/pre-tested commit workflow. We're using a combination of Hudson, Git and https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/[Gerrit], https://seleniumhq.org/[Selenium] and more to make sure that every change going to Digg's https://new.digg.com[new site] has been thoroughly tested. +
