Last week's TWIP enumerated the release of *26* different plugin, this past week has seen 19 unique releases in comparison. You might be tempted to assume that _less_ plugin development has occurred over the past week, which isn't the case. Last week a number of the releases were "code updates", i.e. plugins being rebuilt against the latest Hudson plugin API as opposed to new features or bug-fixes. With the releases of plugins this past week, it seems a large number of the releases contained new features and bug fixes, including *three new plugins!*

Making their Hudson debut are the following

* https://plugins.jenkins.io/systemloadaverage-monitor[Agent Monitor for system load average]
* https://plugins.jenkins.io/toolenv[Tool Environment plugin]
* https://plugins.jenkins.io/ivy[Ivy plugin]

If you're interested in contributing to an existing plugin, or building your own, I highly recommend checking out the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Plugin+tutorial[plugin tutorial] and joining the https://hudson.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList[dev@ mailing list]. That said, here are this week's releases, starting with last Friday.
