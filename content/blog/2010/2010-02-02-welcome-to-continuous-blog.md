Hello and welcome to "Continuous Blog", the official Hudson weblog! If you
don't mind me saying so, I think its arrival is long overdue. Since Hudson
started in November of 2006, there hasn't been a central "voice" for the
project. In just a few short years Hudson has grown into a substantial project
with **hundreds** of plugins and thousands of users around the world.

nice Java-based extensible continuous integration server has grown up into
fantastic tool with a great community around it.


### Goals for this weblog
I think it is important to set out a couple of goals for this weblog, some simple items that should help guide the content and discussion around Continuous Blog and its future.

Continuous Blog should:

* Help advocate the use of Hudson to the larger internet community
* Be a central source for tutorials and helpful information to Hudson users of all skill-levels
* Recognize the numerous contributors to the Hudson project for their efforts


### What to expect

As Continuous Blog grows and matures, you can expect to see a variety of Hudson-related content. Overviews of the latest releases of Hudson and its plugins, interviews and discussions with the developers who have contributed to Hudson over the years, guest posts by power-users on how Hudson fits into their workflow and much much more (really).

If you look around the page you'll already see a good amount of content, in the
sidebar to the right you'll notice the "Recently Released" section which
aggregates recently released plugins via [this RSS
feed](https://hudson.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectRSS?type=news) , the "Blogs"
section which is an aggregation of Hudson community blogs (from [this RSS
feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/KohsukesHudsonBlogs)).

We're just starting out so make sure you [subscribe to the RSS feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/ContinuousBlog), we've got a lot to talk about here on Continuous Blog.
