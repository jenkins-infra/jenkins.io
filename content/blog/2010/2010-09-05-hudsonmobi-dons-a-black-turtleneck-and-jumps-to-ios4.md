Last time I [talked about HudsonMobi 2.0](https://jenkins.io/content/hudsonmobi-20-hits-android-market) there were some hiccups with the QR code which [made me pretty irritated](https://twitter.com/hudsonci/status/21335228733). Now the leading mobile app for Hudson users has regained my trust with their [lastest release for iOS 4](https://hudsonmobi.wordpress.com/2010/09/04/hudsonmobi-for-ios-4-is-here/), the latest incarnation of Apple's mobile operating systems for iPhones and iPod Touches.

Since I fall into the category of subhumans who for one reason or another choose not to own an iPhone, I can't verify the awesomeness of this new HudsonMobi release. If it is anything like the 2.0 release for Android you can expect enhancements such as:

* Tighter integration with iOS 4
* **Embedded artifact viewer!** For archived build artifacts that are text-based, you can view them directly on your handset.
* Access to the build history and changes for a job.
* Quick and easy access to a job's last build


If you own a device with iOS **3.0 or higher** you should be able to download HudsonMobi 2.0 from the appstore, if you give it a whirl, please leave a comment to let me know how awesome it is :)
