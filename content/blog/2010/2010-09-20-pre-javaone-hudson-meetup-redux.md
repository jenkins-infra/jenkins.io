Yesterday Digg was kind enough to host and "sponsor" (read: free drinks and
pizza!) a Hudson meetup at their offices in San Francisco. While Digg has been
the source of some controversy and press due to their recent redesign and corporate
shake-ups, as far as the Hudson community goes they've been largely responsible for
a [great case study on continuous deployment](https://about.digg.com/blog/continuous-deployment-code-review-and-pre-tested-commits-digg4) using Hudson and [Gerrit](https://code.google.com/p/gerrit).

Attendees included all of InfraDNA (Kohsuke and Kedar), some folks from CloudBees, a
number of local users/developers like [LewisHam](https://twitter.com/LewisHam) and myself, and
to top off the list a couple Oracle employees including [Winston Prakash](https://twitter.com/wjprakash) who is now hacking on Hudson inside of Oracle.


As folks started arriving there was a lot of discussion around "Hudson at Scale", specifically
regarding Hudson "in the cloud". We also got to hear about one of the most interesting Hudson
use-cases I've ever seen by [Edward M. Goldberg](https://edwardmgoldberg.com) who I'll post an
interview with shortly, imagine using Hudson with **thousands** of machines, it's that interesting.

Through the afternoon there were a number of great discussions concerning Hudson stability,
engaging more of the community and nitty-gritty details regarding Hudson's internals such
as the plugin API.


I've posted [photos from the event](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hudsonlabs/sets/72157624992088468/) on
Flickr for posterity in case you're interested. Overall I'd judge the meetup to be a success, it was a
lot of fun and a great way to spend a Sunday with Hudson.

If you're going to be at JavaOne, come track me down and let's talk about Hudson, if you're not in San Francisco for the event, you can always follow my updates on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hudsonci) or hit up [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/hudsonlabs/sets/72157624996965000/)
