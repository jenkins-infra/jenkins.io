I say that he is leaving Sun, instead of leaving Oracle as Kohsuke worked at Sun for nine years and Oracle only a few months. In those nine years at Sun, Kohsuke has worked on some great products, the most notable of them being Hudson.

Per Kohsuke's post:

Where am I heading next? I'm actually starting my own company to take Hudson to the next stage.

What this means for Hudson still isn't certain yet, fortunately it means that Hudson will continue to have at least one full-time developer. It remains to be seen where KohsukeCorp (the name has not yet been disclosed) will focus within the Hudson code-base. For the greater user-base of Hudson, this means that the schedule for releases may slow down during this transitional period, there are some logistics to work out with Oracle regarding some of the hardware Hudson has traditionally used to host https://www.crunchbase.com/product/atlassian[JIRA], this blog, and a number of other machines helping support the Hudson project in one fashion or another.

The next couple of months will be interesting for the Hudson community; as per usual you'll be able to get the latest updates from this blog or the https://twitter.com/hudsonci[@hudsonci] twitter account. I'll let Kohsuke finish this post off:

And finally, big thank you to everyone in the Hudson community, and in a broader java.net community. I wouldn't be here without you guys, and I feel very proud that I'm a part of it.
