Intrepid Hudson user Christian Pelster posted a little project of his this week to the "users" link:/content/mailing-lists[mailing list] called: *https://code.google.com/p/hudsontrafficlights/[hudsontrafficlights]*.

Christian describes the project as:

____
This Java based daemon aggregates the status of one or more jobs from a Hudson continous integration server into a single status (red, yellow, green) and invokes a shell script on status change.
____

You can use hudsontrafficlights to control a USB traffic light (such as this https://www.cleware.de/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=23&products_id=118&language=en[USB Traffic Light] from Cleware, GmbH) to give you and your colleagues nearly instant feedback on jobs in Hudson, without ever needing to leave your text editor!+++<center>+++image:https://hudsontrafficlights.googlecode.com/files/CIMG1635.JPG[hudsontrafficlights in action with a Cleware Traffic Light,500]+++</center>+++
