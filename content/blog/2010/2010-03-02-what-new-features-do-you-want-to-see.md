Michael Donohue, a Hudson developer who has taken on the role of master bug triage guy for Hudson, does something regularly which I've really come to appreciate as a Hudson developer myself: he sends out emails to the dev list with the top 10 voted issues at that time. This gives those of us in the Hudson development community a good sense of what's really important to our users, which in turn helps us decide where to focus our efforts. If you're interested, you can see <a href="https://issues.hudson-ci.org/secure/IssueNavigator.jspa?mode=hide&requestId=10045">the top voted issues</a> over at <a href="https://issues.hudson-ci.org">our JIRA server.</a>

A good number of those issues have been high on the list for a while - I'm actually in the early stages of work on a plugin to answer <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-682">HUDSON-682</a>, the current #1 most voted-for issue, two and a half years after it was opened. But I'm sure there are some equally useful features Hudson users would like to see added which aren't on that list. So I'm asking you, dear readers: what are you looking for in Hudson that isn't already there? Take a look around the existing issues - you may find a request that fits what you want lurking just out of the top 10, needing only your vote to push it into the spotlight. If no one's yet created an issue requesting your desired feature, well, create one.

Or, better still, write a plugin or contribute a patch yourself!

**Editor's Note:**  If you're interested in writing a plugin, you can check out [Hudson's wiki](https://wiki.hudson-ci.org) and/or [this guide](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Plugin+tutorial) on the subject.


Andrew Bayer (`abayer`) has been a contributor to Hudson since early 2009, contributing to the ClearCase plugin, Hudson's core and a small number of other plugins. Andrew also helps Kohsuke with a lot of Hudson's project infrastructure, most notably the migration from Bugzilla on Java.net to JIRA running at [issues.hudson-ci.org](https://issues.hudson-ci.org).
