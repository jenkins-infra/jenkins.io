Been a bit pre-occupied this week, so this links roll-up is short and sweet.


* <a id="aptureLink_0EaYmEPTig" href="https://twitter.com/anotherjavadude">The JavaDude</a> details a fairly simple [test application embedding Glassfish + Netbeans + Hudson](https://javadude.wordpress.com/2010/02/22/tutorial-most-simple-test-application-for-embedded-glassfish-netbeans-hudson/)
* Thanks to <a id="aptureLink_HqEoqNmNOh" href="https://twitter.com/chrisbingham">@chrisbingham</a>, discovered a [.NET wrapper for Hudson's remote API](https://code.google.com/p/hudson-lib/)
* Learned all about [getting started with Hudson for .NET projects](https://bobcravens.com/2010/03/01/getting-started-with-ci-using-hudson-for-your-net-projects/) from <a id="aptureLink_0evuIQ516M" href="https://twitter.com/rcravens">Bob Cravens</a> 
* <a id="aptureLink_chC5AJes8Y" href="https://twitter.com/rfletcherEW">Robert Fletcher</a> wrote a groovy post about testing [Grails plugins on Hudson](https://adhockery.blogspot.com/2010/03/grails-plugins-on-hudson.html).
