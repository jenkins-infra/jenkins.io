After an exciting week that saw the rushed release of link:/content/breaking-hudson-1351-released[Hudson 1.351] on Monday following a fairly serious regression, Hudson 1.352 was released mid-Friday with a good mix bug fixes and enhancements. Bundled with this release was another localizations drop including translations for ca, es, fi, fr, hi_IN, it, nl, ru, and sv_SE locales.image:https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/hudson_neon.jpg[] In addition to the nice fancy new community contributed translations, which you can help with by installing the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Translation+Assistance+Plugin[Translation Assistance plugin], the 1.352 release includes the subtle enhancement of hyperlinking URLs in the console output.

In general, 1.352 is looking like a very solid release, that said, here's the breakdown for this release:

=== Bugs fixed

* Fixed a file handle leak when a copy fails. (https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-5899[issue 5899])
* Replace '>' with '_' in username, as already done for '<'. (https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-5833[issue 5833])
* Fix +++<tt>+++editableComboBox+++</tt>+++ to select item when mouse click takes more than 100ms. (https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-2722[issue 2722])
* Fixed NPE when configuring a view without "Regular expression".
* Page shouldn't scroll up when the user opens/closes a stack trace in the test failure report.
* Fixed a bug where Hudson can put a wrong help file link. (https://n4.nabble.com/Resolution-of-help-files-in-jelly-entries-tp1592533p1592533.html[report])
* Fixed Maven site goal archiving from agents. (https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-5943[issue 5943])
* Fixed a regression with NetBeans Hudson plugin progressive console output. (https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-5941[issue 5941])
* Fixed a situation where a failure in plugin start up can prevent massive number of job loss. </ul>

=== Enhancements

* Supported JBoss EAP 5.0.0 GA. (https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-5922[issue 5922])
* CLI commands on protected Hudson now asks a password interactively, if run on Java6.
* Added CLI 'login' and 'logout' commands so that you don't have to specify a credential for individual CLI invocation.
* URLs in the console output are now hyperlinks.
* Improved the URL annotation logic.
* Add drag&drop support for +++<tt>+++f:repeatable+++</tt>+++ lists and use this for the JDK/Ant/Maven installations in global config so these can be reordered.
* Integrated a new round of community-contributed localizations (ca, es, fi, fr, hi_IN, it, nl, ru, and sv_SE locales.)
