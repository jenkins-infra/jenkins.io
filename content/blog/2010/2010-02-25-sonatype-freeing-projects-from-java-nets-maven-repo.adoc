Are you working on a project which uses java.net's https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache%20Maven[Maven] repository for deploying its artifacts?

Well, if so, there's a great opportunity opening up for you to get off that problematic repository: https://www.sonatype.com/[Sonatype] is https://www.sonatype.com/people/2010/02/java-net-maven-repository-rescue-mission-on-march-5th/[helping java.net projects move to Sonatype's hosted OSS Nexus repository], starting March 5th. We're looking into moving Hudson over but for most smaller projects, this should be a no-brainer. Problems with the java.net Maven repository are legendary and Sonatype's OSS Nexus repository is a great alternative.

Take a look and see if this can work for you.
