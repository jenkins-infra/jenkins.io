This past week <a id="aptureLink_z1tlMXupZM" href="https://twitter.com/pycon">PyCon</a> has been going on in Atlanta, where <a id="aptureLink_WLsRDsy9yw" href="https://twitter.com/ctitusbrown">Titus Brown</a> gave a talk titled: 

> Why not run all your tests all the time? A study of continuous integration systems

Titus has some notable quotes "just use Hudson" but overall a good introduction of CI and a breakdown of some of the challenges behind continuous integration. He also does a good job going over getting started with Hudson, setting up a basic Python project that incorporates JUnit XML reporting and slaves. 

> "Yeah, we used Buildbot until recently, then I switched us to Hudson and my life got a lot better"

If you're using Python with Hudson, I highly recommend watching the talk (embedded below).
