Intrepid Hudson user Christian Pelster posted a little project of his this week to the "users" [mailing list](/content/mailing-lists) called: **[hudsontrafficlights](https://code.google.com/p/hudsontrafficlights/)**. 

Christian describes the project as:

> This Java based daemon aggregates the status of one or more jobs from a Hudson continous integration server into a single status (red, yellow, green) and invokes a shell script on status change.

You can use hudsontrafficlights to control a USB traffic light (such as this <a href="https://www.cleware.de/catalog/product_info.php?cPath=23&products_id=118&language=en">USB Traffic Light</a> from Cleware, GmbH) to give you and your colleagues nearly instant feedback on jobs in Hudson, without ever needing to leave your text editor!
