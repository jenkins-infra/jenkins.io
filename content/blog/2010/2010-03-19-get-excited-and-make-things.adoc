Today is Day One of the link:/content/meet-and-hack-alongside-kohsuke-and-co[Bay Area Hudson hackathon/meetup], the hacking will start at 10am today and continue until 5pm at the https://tinyurl.com/yznmdoo[Oracle Santa Clara campus] in the "library" conference room of SCA7 "Mansion" building. The focus today will be largely on hacking Hudson itself.

=== Can't attend?

Not everybody lives in the Bay Area, fortunately all of you are on the internets! There's two ways you can participate remotely in the hackathon:

* *WebEx:* https://cisco.webex.com/ciscosales/j.php?ED=136431942&UID=0&PW=NN2U2OTAwNzg0&RT=MiM0[Meeting Number: 201 389 367, Password: hudson] (audio conference, app sharing, etc)
* *IRC* As always, there's the `#hudson` IRC channel on the Freenode where you can participate via text chat

If you're in the Bay Area, but busy at work today, come by for https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Hudson+Bay+Area+Hackathon+2.0[Day Two] of the hackathon/meetup tomorrow (Saturday) from 10am to 6pm at https://hackerdojo.pbworks.com/[Hacker Dojo] in Mountain View!
