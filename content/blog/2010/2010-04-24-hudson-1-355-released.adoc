Of course, the work never stops on Hudson so we almost have 1.356 ready to roll out the door, but then Kohsuke tweeted this:

____
Because of the data center migration going on, I won't be able to release #hudsonci today.

I won't go into details on some of the infrastructure changes we have lined up just yet, so here's the breakdown of 1.355
// break

==== Bugs fixed

* Colored ball image at top of build pages was broken for Hudson in some web containers (fixed by removing workaround for a Firefox bug fixed since 3.0.5/Dec2008). (https://issue-redirect.jenkins.io/issue/2341[issue 2341])
* Console page while build is running did not wrap lines when viewed in IE. (https://issue-redirect.jenkins.io/issue/5869[issue 5869])
* Fixed build history to indicate test failure for MavenBuild and MavenModuleSetBuild.
* Make `dropdownList` work in repeatable content, such as a build step.

==== Enhancements

* Added the agent retention strategy based on a schedule.
* Added to configure charset option of Mailer.

You can go grab the http://mirrors.jenkins.io/war-stable/latest/jenkins.war[latest .war file] straight from `hudson-ci.org` or if you're using a native package, use your package manager to upgrade.
