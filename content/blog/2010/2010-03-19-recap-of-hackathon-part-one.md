<a id="aptureLink_pnjVAv8djU" href="https://twitter.com/kohsukekawa">Kohsuke</a> just posted a brief write-up on [his personal blog](https://weblogs.java.net/blog/kohsuke/archive/2010/03/19/hudson-hackathon-day-1) about the first day of the [Bay Area Hudson hackathon/meetup](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Hudson+Bay+Area+Hackathon+2.0). He writes:

> Total of 9 people came and we had a great time talking about infrastructure issues, possible enhancements, design dicussions, exchanging tips and plugins that they've developed, and otherwise building personal relationships. 

A number of folks joined us on the `#Hudson` IRC channel on <a id="aptureLink_GzNHS5pDZN" href="https://freenode.net/">Freenode</a> and the WebEx conference, participating remotely. Since day one was primarily intended for hacking on Hudson itself, we're expecting more people tomorrow when we'll have a good mix of folks hacking **on** Hudson, folks hacking **with** Hudson and plain old folks.
