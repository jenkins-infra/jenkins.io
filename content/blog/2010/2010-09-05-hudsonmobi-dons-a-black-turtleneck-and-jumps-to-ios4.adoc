Last time I link:/content/hudsonmobi-20-hits-android-market[talked about HudsonMobi 2.0] there were some hiccups with the QR code which https://twitter.com/hudsonci/status/21335228733[made me pretty irritated]. Now the leading mobile app for Hudson users has regained my trust with their https://hudsonmobi.wordpress.com/2010/09/04/hudsonmobi-for-ios-4-is-here/[latest release for iOS 4], the latest incarnation of Apple's mobile operating systems for iPhones and iPod Touches.

Since I fall into the category of subhumans who for one reason or another choose not to own an iPhone, I can't verify the awesomeness of this new HudsonMobi release. If it is anything like the 2.0 release for Android you can expect enhancements such as:

* Tighter integration with iOS 4
* *Embedded artifact viewer!* For archived build artifacts that are text-based, you can view them directly on your handset.
* Access to the build history and changes for a job.
* Quick and easy access to a job's last build

If you own a device with iOS *3.0 or higher* you should be able to download HudsonMobi 2.0 from the appstore, if you give it a whirl, please leave a comment to let me know how awesome it is :)
