Let me be the first to say **thank you all** for your [overwhelming support](https://twitter.com/#search?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hudson-labs.org%2Fcontent%2Fwhos-driving-thing%2F) for
Hudson and the work we've been doing. The Hudson community in general has
always been incredibly supportive and friendly, but the outpouring of support from
friends and users who've not previously spoken up has been awe inspiring.

That said, let's get down to business. As [I covered
yesterday](https://jenkins.io/content/whos-driving-thing) there is some
bubbling frustration within the developer community regarding some project
infrastructure decisions and Oracle's reactions to them. If you can't spare the
time to read that novel of a blog post, the extremely shortened version is: devs want to
move codebase to GitHub, Oracle disagrees and claims to have final say (hijinks
ensue).


While there is still a lot unresolved, several of the core contributors are
debating and weighing our options for moving forward in a way that best
suits Hudson both as a project and community. In the next couple days, Kohsuke
or Andrew will be proposing a course of action for the community after some of
the options have been fully vetted. Please bear in mind that Hudson is a **very** big project with some fairly unique needs. We have *hundreds* of contributors committing either to core or the plugins, we release core once a week with plugin releases occurring to the tune of 20-40 updates a week. We've been pinging folks who work with various foundations and major open source projects to make sure we're covering all our bases to make sure distractions like this don't come up again for the foreseeable future.




Due to issues with MySQL, Java, OpenOffice/LibreOffice, there is clearly a lot of anti-Oracle emotion out there right now, but I want
to make sure that it's clear that this *is not* about "Us versus Oracle."

Our goal isn't to "stick it to the man," that doesn't help make Hudson any better.

Our goal is to foster the kind of community that we all want to
participate in, and to build and improve the best continuous integration
server available.

Stay tuned :)
