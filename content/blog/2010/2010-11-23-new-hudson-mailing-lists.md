<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/duke-construction.gif" alt="Duke is not amused :(" align="right"/>As Kohsuke [mentioned in this post](https://hudson-labs.org/content/javanet-migration-status-update), the Java.net migration has caught just about everybody off-guard in the Hudson community.

The tools we use hosted by Java.net are essentially locked from us until further notice (no ETA on the migration) which is, as you might imagine frustrating both for the core developers but **hundreds** of plugin developers that make Hudson the best damned CI server on the planet.


For **source code** we're working on getting something in place for contributions on [GitHub](https://github.com/hudson/hudson) thanks to some assistance from the GitHub team.

For **mailing lists** we've gone ahead and dumped Java.net mailing lists in favor of a collection of Google Groups:

 * [hudson-dev](https://groups.google.com/group/hudson-dev/)
 * [hudson-users](https://groups.google.com/group/hudson-users/)
 * [hudson-commits](https://groups.google.com/group/hudson-commits/)
 * [hudson-issues](https://groups.google.com/group/hudson-issues/)

Contrary to popular belief, you **do not need a Google account** to subscribe to these lists, else we wouldn't have chosen Google Groups. All you need to do is send an email to "hudson-users+subscribe@googlegroups.com" and you'll receive a confirmation email from the mailing list server shortly.


Since our [issues.hudson-ci.org](https://issues.hudson-ci.org) isn't actually hosted on Java.net, but rather on a machine provided by Oracle, they *should* continue to function as per usual. The login for the systems is somewhat tied to Java.net so I am honestly not sure how stable they will be this week.


I apologize sincerely for the confusion and frustration, you can trust that we're likely ten-times more frustrated with this situation right now.
