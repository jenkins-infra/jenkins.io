For those of you living in or around Silicon Valley, next Wednesday (March 10th) you might want to reserve some space around 6pm on your calendar. <a id="aptureLink_K4R8mjN6aN" href="https://freddy33.blogspot.com/">Frederic Simon</a> and <a id="aptureLink_j4VWwlQ9I2" href="https://twitter.com/yoavlandman">Yoav Landman</a> from <a id="aptureLink_gvHDYIidrI" href="https://twitter.com/artifrog">JFrog</a> will be presenting at the [Silicon Valley JavaFX Users Group](https://www.meetup.com/svjugfx/) meeting at the Googleplex. Frederic and Yoav will be discussing and demonstrating how JFrog's Artifactory works with Hudson to combine continuous integration with release management.

>Join with the Artifactory team to realize the benefits of managing your software development life-cycle through continuous integration.
>
>Frederic Simon (JFrog Chief Architect) and Yoav Landman (JFrog CTO) will demonstrate how to automate large-scale multi-module projects, using a fully-integrated platform with Artifactory and Hudson.
>
>Using Maven, Gradle or Ivy builds, it is now possible to dynamically automate and manage the pyramidal stacks of Unit, Functional, and Integration Tests.
>
> This demo-based session will show you how Artifactory and Hudson together make it much easier to promote certified builds to milestone releases , and finally to general availability, while making sure all builds are fully reproducible.
>
>Staying dynamic all through the development process avoids code freeze and provides very accurate feedback loops. This is crucial for Developers, QA teams, System and Integration testers, Users, Customers, and all the remaining actors of the development process.
