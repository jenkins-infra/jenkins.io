A few months ago I enjoyed running a couple https://web.archive.org/web/20130514044904/https://jenkins-ci.org/views/interviews[interviews with folks] who were using Hudson but lately I've lacked the time and coffee to get more interviews done. image:/sites/default/files/taperecorder.jpg[Interview time!]

I am planning on making up for it by bringing my fancy smancy tape recorder (i.e. a smartphone) and a few notepads to the upcoming https://www.oracle.com/us/javaonedevelop/index.html[JavaOne conference] here in San Francisco.

If you're interested in talking to me about how you or your company uses Hudson in your quest for world domination, you will be able to find me at the link:/content/pre-javaone-hudson-meetup[Hudson hackathon] on Sunday the 19th, or at JavaOne on Monday, Tuesday and _maybe_ Wednesday.

Feel free to drop me a line at tyler[at]linux.com and we'll set something up!
