The developer for the Hudson extension for Google Chrome, https://github.com/sanitz[Sebastian Sanitz], emailed the `users@` list today to inform the community of an update to his *https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/hfncndbfmjmafoodaigpoicpbdfhhgdo[fantastic extension]*.

Sebastian's extension monitors https://ci.hudson-labs.org[ci.hudson-labs.org] by default, but the URL and polling interval are both trivial to change. When any of the builds in the configured URL fail, you'll see a red "Fail" indicator, otherwise green "Ok".

If you're interested in contributing to the plugin, good news! It's open source! You can find it https://github.com/sanitz/hudson-chrome-extension[on GitHub].
