image:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Kopenhagen_Innenstadt.JPG/280px-Kopenhagen_Innenstadt.JPG[image]September is turning into a meetup month for the Hudson community. In parallel to https://hudson-labs.org/content/hudson-javazone-meetup-oslo[the meetup in Oslo] and https://hudson-labs.org/content/pre-javaone-hudson-meetup[the meetup in JavaOne], https://www.nokia.com/[Nokia] and https://infradna.com/[InfraDNA] are hosting a meetup in Copenhagen on September 6th, Monday. Read on for the details.



The current tentative plan is to do a short "state of the union / what's new" kind of presentation, then use the rest of the time for open mic Q&A, but if you have other ideas, or better yet if you want to do some talks, please let me know. I think the event will be fun.



If you plan on coming, please mailto:event@infradna.com[drop me a note], so that we can get some sense of the attendance.
