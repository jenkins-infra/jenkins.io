Since I've been a bit pre-occupied with non-Hudson related activities lately, I have missed a few days of link rollups, I suppose it's fitting to get a couple days worth of links in one post.

While The Build Doctor has the time to follow the continuous integration world and post links on a daily basis, I haven't found the same quantity of Hudson links on a day-to-day basis. Therefore, I will be posting a link-rollup every few days. Do let me know if this is too infrequent. That said, here's some interesting links!

 ** Indie iPhone app developer https://twitter.com/JeffSchilling[Jeff Schilling] writes about working more efficient with Hudson and Cocoa for developing iPhone apps, he covers https://developer.apple.com/tools/unittest.html[OCUnit] integration and code coverage with https://software.sandia.gov/trac/fast/wiki/Documentation/gcovr[gcovr], a good read for iPhone and Mac developers alike.
