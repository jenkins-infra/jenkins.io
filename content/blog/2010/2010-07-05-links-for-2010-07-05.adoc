It's been quite a while since I posted a Hudson links-roundup post, so without further ado, here goes nothing

* Max tells us about using https://techmodblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/hudson-and-codescanner.html[Hudson with Symbian's CodeScanner] tool.
* Running agents on Mac OS X? Mirko has https://illegalstateexception.blogspot.com/2010/07/using-launchctl-to-restart-hudson-mac.html[some handy launchctl foo] for keeping his JNLP agents online
* Scott threw up a great configuration sample for running https://sleeplesscoding.blogspot.com/2010/07/hudson-ci-behind-nginx-reverse-proxy.html[Hudson with an Nginx reverse proxy with SSL]
* Mark walks us through using Xvfb to run https://markgandolfo.com/2010/07/01/hudson-ci-server-running-cucumber-in-headless-mode-xvfb[headless cucumber/selenium tests with Hudson]
* Our friends behind Build Doctor wrote https://www.build-doctor.com/2010/07/01/announcing-xfd[an interesting build radiator] that works seamlessly with Hudson.
