https://jz10.java.no/[JavaZone] is a big Java conference in Scandinavia, and Hudson is well represented there. On September 8th, Håkon Snøtun will be presenting "Top 5 plugins for Hudson and Chuck Norris." and on September 9th, I'll be presenting "Getting more out of your Hudson."



But more importantly, what is a conference without drinking!? So in that spirit, https://infradna.com/[InfraDNA] will be organizing a Hudson User Meetup at https://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&q=Oslo&ie=UTF8&hq=&hnear=Oslo,+Norway&ll=59.912614,10.743604&spn=0.001589,0.004823&t=h&z=18[The Scotsman] from Sep 8th 19:30 (https://www.scotsman.no/[website].) We'll get together, have some drinks, and enjoy geeky conversations.




So if you are local or visiting Oslo for JavaZone, come join us. If you plan to join us at The Scotsman, please mailto:kohsuke@infradna.com[RSVP], and watch out for https://twitter.com/kohsukekawa[my twitter updates] for any last minute time/location changes.
