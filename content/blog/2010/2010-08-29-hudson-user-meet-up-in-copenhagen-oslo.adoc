I'll be in Copenhagen from 9/5-9/7 and in Oslo 9/8-9/9 to present in JavaZone. I'd like to take advantage of the opportunities and have user meet-up events in those cities. Depending on the number of participants, it could be just a drink in a bar, or a talk in a meeting room.

So if you are:

. in those cities,
. available in the evening of 9/6, 9/8, or 9/9, and
. willing to attend such an event,

\... then please link:mailto:kohsuke@infradna.com[let me know.]

Also, if you have an office in those cities and willing to provide a space for an event, that would be extra appreciated!
