In case you haven't been following along at home, I'll try to catch you up as impartially as possible.

== The Facts

* *2009.06.02*: After substantial problems with Java.net infrastructure, the
https://hudson.361315.n4.nabble.com/On-the-future-of-Hudson-hosting-and-infrastructure-td393278.html[dev community discusses new infrastructure
options],
including SourceForge, Google Code, Kenai, Berlios, GitHub, etc. Instead of
moving the entire project, some key components such as the
https://issues.hudson-ci.org[issues.hudson-ci.org] are moved off of
Java.net. Discussions about moving source code off of Java.net and onto other hosts like
GitHub come up almost every four months on the mailing lists, typically
coinciding with serious Java.net downtime or reliability issues..
* *2010.11.01*: A discussion occurs on the developers mailing list about
adding https://twitter.com/wjprakash[Winston Prakash], the Oracle engineer re-assigned to replace https://twitter.com/kohsukekawa[Kohsuke Kawaguchi] (Hudson
founder/lead developer), as a co-owner to the Java.net project. Winston
mentions that his question was driven by Oracle management who felt he should
"co-own the project." After a round of discussion, it's decided by the devs
list that it's acceptable and grants Winston co-ownership of the project as a
sign of good faith from the community towards Oracle.
* *2010.11.17*: https://twitter.com/abayer[Andrew Bayer], core contributor
and maintainer of numerous plugins emails the users and devs list with a
proposal to move the mailing lists off of Java.net which has had notorious
reliability issues within the Java ecosystem and was scheduled for a series of
downtimes and migrations over the coming weeks. Google Groups is selected as the
most reasonable by the community.
* *2010.11.19*: Hudson project is lumped into the same Java.net migration bucket as Glassfish. Emails are sent to project owners, the users and the developers list. The mail to users and developers never arrives due to the sender not being subscribed. Both project owners (Kohsuke, Winston) miss the message, leaving the Hudson community in the dark regarding the pending migration.
* *2010.11.22*: Shortly after midnight, Jacob Robertson reports that his
SVN credentials no longer work, Kohsuke informs the developers list that the project is
locked due to the migration, SVN is inaccessible and mailing lists fail shortly after that. image:https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/health-40to59.gif[]The Hudson Java.net project
begins its migration from the legacy infrastructure to the newer
Java.net infrastructure (formerly known as "Kenai"). A group of core Hudson
community members accelerate the move to Google Groups, pushing out
announcements via https://hudson-labs.org/content/new-hudson-mailing-lists[this
blog] and
https://twitter.com/hudsonci[twitter] hoping to keep as many members in the
loop as possible.
* *2010.11.23*: Frustrated by the locking down of Hudson's source code,
which sees between 3-8 commits to "core" a day, not counting the 300+
plugins, Kohsuke https://groups.google.com/group/hudson-dev/browse_thread/thread/8d3cf0ca1240280a[proposes moving to
GitHub]
on the new developers mailing list. The general consensus amongst the plugin
and core developers was to go forward with moving to GitHub, no major
objections were raised by the developer community.
* *2010.11.27*: After Thanksgiving, Andrew Bayer submits the "https://groups.google.com/group/hudson-dev/browse_thread/thread/c935a4740af0b920[formal
proposal]"
for migrating over to GitHub, Sets a deadline of the following tuesday
(2010.11.30) for raising any major objections before "flipping the switch."

The Monday morning prior to the planned switchover to GitHub, Oracle Senior VP
of Tools and Middleware https://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/press/Spokespeople/016474[Ted
Farrell] sent https://groups.google.com/group/hudson-users/msg/cf0d72a7d97f2438[a
message to the users list] expressing concerns he had regarding the migration of
the Hudson codebase from Java.net to GitHub:
// break

____
_Oracle's goal is to grow the community and make hudson stronger. You all might not be aware of this, but the actual hudson user base is very large. Much bigger than what you see on the mailing lists or in the forums. The unfortunate part of that is how many of these users do not contribute to the core, and do not participate in these discussions. They want to do that, but don't feel like they can be heard. We want them to be heard. We need to make the hudson community a place that will welcome all the hudson users and encourage its growth and longevity. We will be announcing some changes in the upcoming weeks that we believe will foster that._

For now, however, we are going to stay on the java.net
infrastructure.  We believe it is important for hudson to stay
connected with the rest of the java community, as well as take
advantage of some of the cool changes we will have coming to
java.net.  Moving to GIT can be done while staying on java.net.  It is
not a requirement to move to github.

...

Because it is open source, we can't stop anybody from forking it.  We
do however own the trademark to the name so you cannot use the name
outside of the core community.  We acquired that as part of Sun.  We
hope that everyone working on hudson today will do as they claim to
want, and work with us to make hudson stronger.</em>

(Ted's message was rather long, you can read the https://groups.google.com/group/hudson-users/msg/cf0d72a7d97f2438[whole
post here])

As one might expect, Ted's response to the thread was received with
mixed responses ranging from general confusion to obvious frustration.

Long time contributor to Hudson's Git plugin, https://github.com/magnayn[Nigel Magnay] tried to clarify the benefits of migrating to GitHub instead of using Git on the "new" Java.net as succinctly as possible:

____
_Just having git support != git support on github. They work full time on providing the best community development tools; I doubt kenai could even catch up, let alone surpass what they're doing._

...

I'm confused.

What things are you saying you will not let the Hudson developer community
do?

I.E: Are you saying that, as the holders of the Hudson 'name', you are
prohibiting the developer community from choosing (for ourselves) to migrate
the infrastructure (bug tracking / wiki)? The repositories ?

So far the response from the developers has been pretty strongly in favour
of the migration to google groups for mail, to github for code repositories
and collaboration, and to a self-hosted site for bug tracking and
information.</em>

Ted's response to Nigel contained one of the most important nugget of
information for the whole discussion nestled in the middle of https://groups.google.com/group/hudson-users/msg/5540655e05ef2982[the message]:

____
_Nigel, what I am saying is that I believe the _final_ decision of what to do w.r.t. infrastructure belongs to Oracle and that decision should be made according to the will of the community as it makes sense_
____

== The part where I editorialize

I readily admit, there is a lot of information to take in here, for clarification there are two distinct "communities" involved in Hudson:

* *developers*: the _hundreds_ of developers actively communicating on the
  https://groups.google.com/group/hudson-dev[developers list] and
  contributing to the 300+ plugins
* *users*: tens of thousands of individuals and companies using Hudson
either as a straight `.war` file, or using the native packages provided by
the community

The fundamental issue here is that the *developers* want to make a change in
how _they_ contribute to Hudson, and have made their voices heard to that end.
From the users' perspective, such a change would have literally *zero* impact
on them, which makes Oracle's conflation of the two sides of Hudson
particularly frustrating.

Part of the impasse between Oracle management and the developer community lies
in an inherent meritocracy in any large open source project, whether it be the
Linux kernel, the Python language and runtime, or the PostgreSQL database
server, those that contribute carry more weight within the community
*because* they are actively pushing things forward. On top of that, Oracle
continues to cite a "larger community" that's apparently larger than those
active committing to Hudson on a daily or weekly basis, without naming names or
citing specific contributions.

Ted, and in turn, Oracle's approach to the Hudson community seems to stem from
a systematic misunderstanding of how most (if not all) major open source
projects operate. Mentioning closed-door meetings between Sonatype and Oracle
regarding "how to make Hudson better" do nothing to aid many developers'
concerns about Oracle's commitment to Hudson as an open source project or a
community.

In my humble opinion, we are being told one thing while Oracle's actions speak
to another. Insisting that Hudson development remain on Java.net, after the
development community committed to GitHub, contradicts the words promising to
work with the Hudson community and to help facilitate its growth. Asserting
that Oracle isn't trying to exert unwelcome control over the project, while
doing exactly that.

Personally, I do want Oracle to continue to be involved, along with CloudBees,
Sonatype and many other companies that contribute to the ever-growing Hudson
ecosystem. The involvement of a plethora of different companies only helps
emphasize the importance of Hudson to the developer community and underline the
value of Hudson as a community owned and operated project.

December will be an interesting month, stay tuned.
