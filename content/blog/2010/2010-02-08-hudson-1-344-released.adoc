The latest release of Hudson, 1.344, was released on February 5th, 2010. The release contains primarily bug-fixes but has a few enhancements baked into it as well. As mentioned in "link:/content/incoming-more-translations[[Incoming! More Translations]", 1.344 incorporates a number of community-driven translations (see the other post for more information). Additionally, 1.344 removes the "easter egg" background image I wrote about in a post to my personal blog: http://unethicalblogger.com/posts/2010/01/mourning_sun[Mourning Sun] Enough of the small talk, here's the breakdown.

== Bugs fixed

* Removed the forced upper casing in parameterized builds. (https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-5391[issue 5391])
* Password parameter on the disk should be encrypted. (https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-5420[issue 5420])
* Duplicate entries on Upstream/Downstream project with "Build modules in parallel". (https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-5293[issue 5293])
* "Projects tied on" should be "Projects tied to". (https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-5451[issue 5451])
* Fixed the bug that prevents update center metadata retrieval in Jetty. (https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-5210[issue 5210])

== Enhancements

* Show which plugins have already been upgraded in Plugin Manager. (https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-2313[issue 2313])
* Show Hudson upgrade status on manage page instead of offering same upgrade again. (https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-3055[issue 3055])
* Make badges in build history line up. (https://web.archive.org/web/20100524080401/https://hudson.361315.n4.nabble.com/Align-lock-sign-of-keep-build-forever-td1016427.html[report])

As usual, you can go grab the http://mirrors.jenkins.io/war-stable/latest/jenkins.war[latest .war file] straight from `hudson-ci.org` or if you're using a native package, use your package manager to upgrade.

*Update:* This post was written a day before https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-5536[issue 5536] was discovered. I recommend waiting until 1.345 to update any production Hudson instances.
