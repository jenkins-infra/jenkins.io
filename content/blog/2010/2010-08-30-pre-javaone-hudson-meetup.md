As we near autumn up here in the Northern Hemisphere, the wind is starting to blow a bit chillier and here in the Bay Area that can only mean one thing: <strike>Oracle is suing everybody!</strike> it's time for JavaOne!

A whole lot has changed since last year, Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle, [Kohsuke](https://kohsuke.org/) left Snoracle to found [InfraDNA](https://web.archive.org/web/20100612130510/http://infradna.com/) and Hudson has continued to [power on](https://jenkins.io/content/cloudbees-announce-hudson-service) as the single **best** continuous integration server on the planet.

While the tickets for Oracle OpenWorld/JavaOne are just as outrageously expensive as they were last year, we **are** hosting a meetup/hackathon/continuous-drinking-contest at [Digg](https://about.digg.com/opensource) the Sunday prior. We have not yet set any kind of agenda, but some core Hudson hackers and plenty of plugin developers should be in town so it should be a great time hacking on and/or with Hudson.

<big><a href="https://www.meetup.com/hudsonmeetup/calendar/14515128/">RSVP Here!</a></big>

* **When:** September 19th, 1:00 p.m.
* **Location:** Digg's Office: 1040 Mariposa St - Suite 100, San Francisco, CA 94107
