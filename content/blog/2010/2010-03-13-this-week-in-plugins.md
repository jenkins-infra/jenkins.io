Apologies for the slight delay in posting another [TWiP](https://jenkins.io/node/tags/plugins), both within the Hudson community and outside of it, it was quite a busy week. This past week we've had roughly **15** plugins released, with a few going through a number of iterations over the course of the week such as the [Emma plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Emma+Plugin) and one of Hudson's newest plugins, the [Libvirt Slaves plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Libvirt+Slaves+Plugin).
<!--break-->
One of Hudson's most active contributors, Alan Harder (a.k.a `mindless`) was responsible for this week's only new plugin: [Copy Artifact Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Copy+Artifact+Plugin). The Copy Artifact plugin does exactly what you'd think it does, according to the short-and-sweet wiki page:

> Adds a build step to copy artifacts from another project.


**Note:** If you're a plugin developer in the Bay Area, this upcoming Friday and Saturday is the [Bay Area Hudson Hackathon/Meetup](https://jenkins.io/content/meet-and-hack-alongside-kohsuke-and-co); don't miss out!
