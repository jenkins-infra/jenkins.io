I had briefly contemplating what sort of silly posts I could write to celebrate April Fool's Day, when I sat down to write out some of them, I got a few sentences in and decided that they just weren't funny enough. Either I have very high standards, or I'm terribly unfunny.

The web is awash with April Fool's articles, comics, headlines and everything else, so instead I'm going to just give you a few useful links.

*A couple of Twitter links*

Besides the https://twitter.com/hudsonci[@hudsonci] account, you can also follow a couple of Hudson's more notable (or was it notorious?) hackers, such as our benevolent dictator, https://twitter.com/kohsukekawa[Kohsuke Kawaguchi]. https://twitter.com/bshine[Ben Shine] from Yahoo! who's been working pretty hard on making Hudson prettier. Then there's https://twitter.com/wakaleo[John Ferguson Smart] who's been working on a http://www.wakaleo.com/books/continuous-integration-with-hudson-the-book[Hudson book]. Of course I've tried to collect as many Hudson contributors as possible in the https://twitter.com/hudsonci/contributors[@contributors Twitter list].

*Hacking Hudson*

When starting to hack Hudson, it's useful to start by understanding https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Building+Hudson[how to build Hudson]. If hacking Hudson's core isn't your cup of tea, you can always start with the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Plugin+tutorial[plugin tutorial] and try your hand at writing another awesome Hudson plugin. If you find yourself struggling to find out what methods do what while you're hacking, you can always visit the regularly updated, https://hudson.dev.java.net/nonav/javadoc/[online Javadocs for Hudson]

*Communicate*
The two primary mediums for communicating with the Hudson community are through the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Mailing%20List[mailing lists] and the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/IRC+Channel[IRC channel]. During "regular business hours" for the pacific standard time zone, you can usually get some decent real-time help or answers to most of your queries.

I'd list more, but I'm too busy reading about https://techcrunch.com/2010/03/31/exclusive-google-to-go-nuclear/[Google's nuclear weapons program]. ;)
