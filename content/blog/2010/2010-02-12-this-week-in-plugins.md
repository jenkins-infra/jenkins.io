Since this is the first "This Week in Plugins" (TWiP), I'm trying a fairly basic format out. I'm debating how much information I want to include in these, while I would like to include details on "what's changed" for each plugin over the course of the week, the means of fetching that information would be incredibly tedious (read: no fun) since there's not particularly any standard meta-data to be scraped from the [wiki](https://wiki.jenkins.io). Duplicates have been pruned from the list, meaning the latest release of a plugin is what's being shown; sorting is also by day of release then alphabetical.
