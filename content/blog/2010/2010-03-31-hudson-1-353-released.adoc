Due to a problem with the Kohsuke's https://github.com/kohsuke/hudson[GitHub mirror] of Hudson's core, I can't mine the commits for interesting information as per usual so you'll just have to trust that Hudson 1.353 is chock full of good, wholesome bug fixes. If the problem persists next week, I'll find a better way to dig up information on particularly releases that doesn't depend on the GitHub mirror.
