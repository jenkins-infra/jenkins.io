As we near autumn up here in the Northern Hemisphere, the wind is starting to blow a bit chillier and here in the Bay Area that can only mean one thing: +++<strike>+++Oracle is suing everybody!+++</strike>+++ it's time for JavaOne!

A whole lot has changed since last year, Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle, https://kohsuke.org/[Kohsuke] left Snoracle to found https://web.archive.org/web/20100612130510/http://infradna.com/[InfraDNA] and Hudson has continued to link:/content/cloudbees-announce-hudson-service[power on] as the single *best* continuous integration server on the planet.

While the tickets for Oracle OpenWorld/JavaOne are just as outrageously expensive as they were last year, we *are* hosting a meetup/hackathon/continuous-drinking-contest at https://about.digg.com/opensource[Digg] the Sunday prior. We have not yet set any kind of agenda, but some core Hudson hackers and plenty of plugin developers should be in town so it should be a great time hacking on and/or with Hudson.
