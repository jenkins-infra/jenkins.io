As I mentioned in the footer of the post on the link:/blog/2010/02/08/hudson-1-344-released/[Hudson 1.344 release], there were a couple big regressions in the 1.344 release that were causing a number of users issues (such as https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-5536[issue 5536] and https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-5546[issue 5546]).

As a result, Kohsuke and the team have quickly pushed out a hot-fix release: 1.345. Here's the break down:

==== Bugs fixed:

* Update center retrieval, "build now" link, and real-time console update was broken in 1.344 (https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-5536[issue 5536])
* Fixed the backward incompatibility introduced in HUDSON-5391 fix in 1.344. (https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-5391[issue 5391])

If you have already updated to 1.344, your "Update Center" is most likely busted and you'll need to download the `hudson.war` file manually.

You can go grab the http://mirrors.jenkins.io/war-stable/latest/jenkins.war[latest .war file] straight from `hudson-ci.org` or if you're using a native package, use your package manager to upgrade.
