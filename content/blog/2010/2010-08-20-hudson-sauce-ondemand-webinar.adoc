On September 1st, I'll be https://saucelabs.com/about/webinars#webinar-hudson[presenting in a Sauce Labs webinar about Hudson and Sauce OnDemand]. The talk will discuss how Hudson can be used with Sauce OnDemand, naturally, but it'll also cover broader Hudson/Selenium integrations.

Please https://www1.gotomeeting.com/register/789261128[register to this free event], and looking forward to seeing to you virtually.
