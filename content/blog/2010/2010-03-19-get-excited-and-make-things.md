<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/getexcited.jpg" alt="Get excited and make things" align="right"/>The day of hackery is upon us! Today is Day One of the [Bay Area Hudson hackathon/meetup](https://jenkins.io/content/meet-and-hack-alongside-kohsuke-and-co), the hacking will start at 10am today and continue until 5pm at the [Oracle Santa Clara campus](https://tinyurl.com/yznmdoo) in the "library" conference room of SCA7 "Mansion" building. The focus today will be largely on hacking Hudson itself.

### Can't attend?

Not everybody lives in the Bay Area, fortunately all of you are on the internets! There's two ways you can participate remotely in the hackathon:

* **WebEx:** [Meeting Number: 201 389 367, Password: hudson](https://cisco.webex.com/ciscosales/j.php?ED=136431942&UID=0&PW=NN2U2OTAwNzg0&RT=MiM0) (audio conference, app sharing, etc)
* **IRC** As always, there's the `#hudson` IRC channel on the Freenode where you can participate via text chat


If you're in the Bay Area, but busy at work today, come by for [Day Two](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Hudson+Bay+Area+Hackathon+2.0) of the hackathon/meetup tomorrow (Saturday) from 10am to 6pm at <a id="aptureLink_NCAhpsucbO" href="https://hackerdojo.pbworks.com/">Hacker Dojo</a> in Mountain View!
