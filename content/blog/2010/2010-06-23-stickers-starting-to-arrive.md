Way back in March, I asked you all: [Want some Hudson stickers?](https://jenkins.io/content/want-some-hudson-stickers) 

Turns out, a **lot** of you do! Thanks to a huge amuont of help by [my future wife ](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/erinandtylerswedding.com/images/gallery/mq/img-9.jpg), the *first* shipment of Hudson stickers went into the mail last week. <img src="https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2743/4425921960_a056d816f1_m.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" vspace="5"/> This first shipment was only to United States addresses! If you live outside of the U.S., or if you requested more than 50-ish stickers, I've not yet been able to send you stickers. I expect to start sending out international shipments later this week and early next week.

To those of you that have received your stickers, I'd like to remind you of the terms of our agreement:

 * **Conferences**: The only condition being that you tell me all about the event and how Hudson was received after the fact (this may involve an interview).
 * **Companies**: I always appreciate stickers, pens, branded bouncy balls, etc (see: swag) in return!
 * **Nice People**: If you're just a fan of Hudson, stickers, or both, I'll still gladly mail you a few stickers with the condition that you take pictures of where the stickers end up (and maybe of your Hudson install) and either email me some cool pictures or post them to  Flickr (tagged: "hudsonstickers")

To be honest, I *really* just want to see some pictures of Hudson stickers slapped all over cool stuff: laptops, bosses, servers, desks, stop signs, coworkers, cats, you name it.


**If you did not request stickers, but want some now:** please refer to the [original post](https://jenkins.io/content/want-some-hudson-stickers) for directions. I do still have stickers left, but there are some "bulk requests" I've not yet filled. I will do my best to send out as many stickers as I can.
