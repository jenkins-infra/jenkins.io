Historically, our fearless leader Kohsuke has blogged [on Java.net](https://www.java.net/blog/kohsuke). The setup made a whole lot of sense when Kohsuke was employed by Sun, then Oracle, which sponsors and runs [Java.net](https://java.net). In a post earlier this week discussing [console markups](https://www.java.net/blog/kohsuke/archive/2010/04/14/hudson-console-markups), Kohsuke casually pointed out that he will be cross-posting to Java.net, and his personal blog located at [kohsuke.org](https://kohsuke.org). The [first post](https://kohsuke.org/2010/04/12/hello/) over on Kohsuke.org welcomes us:

> For the longest time I havenâ€™t really done anything about kohsuke.org, but as I left Sun/Oracle, I decided to put a bit more effort into it. So this is the new home.
> 
> For the time being, I plan to post my blogs both on java.net and here.

If you're a reader of feeds, I recommend adding the [rss feed](https://kohsuke.org/feed/) for the blog to your list of interesting continuous integration/hacker feeds.
