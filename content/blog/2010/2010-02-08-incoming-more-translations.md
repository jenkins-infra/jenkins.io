As [Kohsuke](https://twitter.com/kohsukekawa) mentioned on the dev@ [mailing
list](http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Mailing+List) on January 29th,
another series of community translations of Hudson have been committed
([r26764](http://hudson-ci.org/commit/26764)) and have been released with the
Hudson 1.344 release.

The locales included in this update are:

 - Czech
 - Spanish
 - Finnish
 - French
 - Hungarian
 - Japanese
 - Korean
 - Lithuanian
 - Norwegian
 - Dutch
 - Polish
 - Brazilian Portuguese
 - Russian
 - Slovenian
 - Swedish
 - Chinese (Simplified/Traditional)

If you're fluent in any of the locales above, check out the latest release of Hudson to verify that the translations are correct, if there's translations that you feel are incorrect, you can report them in [JIRA](http://issues.hudson-ci.org).

The Hudson [Internationalization](http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Internationalization) project could always use some more help whether it be from patches or via the [Translation Assistance Plugin](http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Translation+Assistance+Plugin).
