Since I've been a bit pre-occupied with non-Hudson related activities lately, I have missed a few days of link rollups, I suppose it's fitting to get a couple days worth of links in one post.

While The Build Doctor has the time to follow the continuous integration world and post links on a daily basis, I haven't found the same quantity of Hudson links on a day-to-day basis. Therefore, I will be posting a link-rollup every few days. Do let me know if this is too infrequent. That said, here's some interesting links!

* [That feels better â€“ Cocoa, Hudson and running green](https://manicwave.com/blog/2010/03/01/that-feels-better-cocoa-hudson-and-running-green/)
   * Indie iPhone app developer [Jeff Schilling](https://twitter.com/JeffSchilling) writes about working more efficient with Hudson and Cocoa for developing iPhone apps, he covers <a id="aptureLink_9JORBhLtgT" href="https://developer.apple.com/tools/unittest.html">OCUnit</a> integration and code coverage with <a id="aptureLink_TSZPxfJ0Oi" href="https://software.sandia.gov/trac/fast/wiki/Documentation/gcovr">gcovr</a>, a good read for iPhone and Mac developers alike.
