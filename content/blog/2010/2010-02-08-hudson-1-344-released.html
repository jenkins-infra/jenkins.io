The latest release of Hudson, 1.344, was released on February 5th, 2010. The
release contains primarily bug-fixes but has a few enhancements baked into it
as well. As mentioned in "<a href="/content/incoming-more-translations">[Incoming! More
    Translations</a>",
1.344 incorporates a number of community-driven translations (see the other
post for more information). Additionally, 1.344 removes the "easter egg"
background image I wrote about in a post to my personal blog: <a href="http://unethicalblogger.com/posts/2010/01/mourning_sun">Mourning Sun</a>

Enough of the small talk, here's the breakdown.

As usual, you can go grab the <a href="http://mirrors.jenkins.io/war-stable/latest/jenkins.war">latest .war file</a> straight from `hudson-ci.org` or if you're using a native package, use your package manager to upgrade.

<strong>Update:</strong> This post was written a day before <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-5536">issue 5536</a> was discovered. I recommend waiting until 1.345 to update any production Hudson instances.
