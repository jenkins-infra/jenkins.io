Last night on my way out of San Francisco I stopped by 4th and Howard St to get my first taste of JavaOne/Oracle OpenWorld which was already taking shape at the location. Besides snapping the photo below, I also managed to get yelled out by an old woman wearing a red "security" jacket; suffice to say my JavaOne experience is already everything I expected!+++<center>+++image:https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4107/4997929716_1675745efe.jpg[Oracle taking over Howard St,500,link=https://www.flickr.com/photos/agentdero/4997929716/]+++</center>+++

Unlike last year's Oracle OpenWorld, which also shut down this segment of Howard St in San Francisco and took over the adjacent Yerba Buena Gardens, this event will be crammed together with JavaOne. image:https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4084/4998934102_d7c71e575e_m.jpg[20100917_003.jpg,240,link=https://www.flickr.com/photos/agentdero/4998934102/]

At this point I'm not sure what I can expect as far as the JavaOne portion of the event goes, we do have *two* Hudson related events scheduled:
// break

* *Getting More Out of Your Hudson* - Monday at 10:00 a.m. - Hosted by our very own https://twitter.com/kohsukekawa[Kohsuke Kawaguchi], the session will be 60 minutes at Parc 55, Embarcadero.
* *Getting More from Your CI Server: Taking Hudson to the Next Level* - Tuesday at 9:30 a.m. - Hosted by the (in)famous https://twitter.com/wakeleo[John Smart] the session will also be 60 minutes at Parc 55, Cyril Magnin 1.

Unfortunately those were the only specifically-Hudson related tracks I could find, as https://twitter.com/abayer[Andrew Bayer] has https://twitter.com/abayer/status/24507253586[mentioned before], finding a proper schedule is near impossible. While at JavaOne, I intend on posting updates, pictures and maybe a little scathing commentary (they did give me a blogger pass for some silly reason).

If you're going to be at JavaOne, link:/content/lets-talk-about-hudson-javaone[think about coming and talking to me] about how you/your company uses Hudson. I might just have stickers!
