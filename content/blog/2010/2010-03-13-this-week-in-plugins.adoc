Apologies for the slight delay in posting another link:/blog/tags/plugins[TWiP], both within the Hudson community and outside of it, it was quite a busy week. This past week we've had roughly *15* plugins released, with a few going through a number of iterations over the course of the week such as the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Emma+Plugin[Emma plugin] and one of Hudson's newest plugins, the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Libvirt+Slaves+Plugin[Libvirt Slaves plugin].

One of Hudson's most active contributors, Alan Harder (a.k.a `mindless`) was responsible for this week's only new plugin: https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Copy+Artifact+Plugin[Copy Artifact Plugin]. The Copy Artifact plugin does exactly what you'd think it does, according to the short-and-sweet wiki page:

____
Adds a build step to copy artifacts from another project.
____

NOTE: If you're a plugin developer in the Bay Area, this upcoming Friday and Saturday is the link:/content/meet-and-hack-alongside-kohsuke-and-co[Bay Area Hudson Hackathon/Meetup]; don't miss out!
