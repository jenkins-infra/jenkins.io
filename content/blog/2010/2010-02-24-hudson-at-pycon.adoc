This past week https://twitter.com/pycon[PyCon] has been going on in Atlanta, where https://twitter.com/ctitusbrown[Titus Brown] gave a talk titled:

____
Why not run all your tests all the time? A study of continuous integration systems

Titus has some notable quotes "just use Hudson" but overall a good introduction of CI and a breakdown of some of the challenges behind continuous integration. He also does a good job going over getting started with Hudson, setting up a basic Python project that incorporates JUnit XML reporting and agents.

"Yeah, we used Buildbot until recently, then I switched us to Hudson and my life got a lot better"
