Via the https://twitter.com/hudsonci[@hudsonci] twitter account I typically share or "retweet" a number of links during the day, I realize a number of people either do not use Twitter or do not constantly pay attention to it. A lot of the links I find quite interesting, so I'd like to try sharing them after the fact here.
