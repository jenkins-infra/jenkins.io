Finishing off the second week in March, the Hudson team rolled Hudson 1.350 off the assembly line last Friday, bringing a *slew* of fixes. Of particular interest to users of Hudson's various native packages for https://www.crunchbase.com/company/red-hat[Red Hat], https://www.opensuse.org/[openSuSE], https://www.ubuntu.com/[Ubuntu/Debian] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris%20%28operating%20system%29[Solaris], was a change that suppress the "self-upgrade" functionality in the "Manage Hudson" page. On the enhancements side of the fence, the team added authentication support to the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Hudson+CLI[Hudson CLI] (https://issue-redirect.jenkins.io/issue/3796[issue 3796]) allowing Hudson users with locked down installations to take advantage of everything the CLI has to offer.

Alan's been doing some great work on Hudson's internals, if you're coming out to link:/content/meet-and-hack-alongside-kohsuke-and-co[this weekend's hackathon], but sure to pat him on the back for his tireless efforts.

* Fix handling of relative paths in alternate settings.xml path for Maven projects. (https://issue-redirect.jenkins.io/issue/4693[issue 4693])
* Alternate settings, private repository, profiles, etc were not used in embedded Maven for deploy publisher. (https://issue-redirect.jenkins.io/issue/4939[issue 4939])
* Make +++<tt>+++editableComboBox+++</tt>+++ work in repeatable content, such as a build step.
* If content is captured using +++<tt>+++<j:set var="..">..content..</j:set>+++</tt>+++, fixed this to use proper HTML rendering when appropriate.
* '<' and '&' in the console output was not escaped since 1.349 (https://issue-redirect.jenkins.io/issue/5852[issue 5852])
* Fixed an +++<tt>+++AbstractMethodError+++</tt>+++ in SCM polling under some circumstances. (https://issue-redirect.jenkins.io/issue/5756[issue 5756])

* The Maven Integration plugin link in the Update Center was going to a dead location. (https://issue-redirect.jenkins.io/issue/4811[issue 4811])
* On RPM/DEB/etc installation, don't offer the self upgrade. It should be done by the native package manager. (https://n4.nabble.com/RPM-for-Hudson-1-345-does-not-Upgrade-Automatically-tp1579580p1579580.html[report])
