Finishing off the second week in March, the Hudson team rolled Hudson 1.350 off the assembly line last Friday, bringing a *slew* of fixes. Of particular interest to users of Hudson's various native packages for https://www.crunchbase.com/company/red-hat[Red Hat], https://www.opensuse.org/[openSuSE], https://www.ubuntu.com/[Ubuntu/Debian] and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris%20%28operating%20system%29[Solaris], was a change that suppress the "self-upgrade" functionality in the "Manage Hudson" page. On the enhancements side of the fence, the team added authentication support to the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Hudson+CLI[Hudson CLI] (https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-3796[issue 3796]) allowing Hudson users with locked down installations to take advantage of everything the CLI has to offer.

Alan's been doing some great work on Hudson's internals, if you're coming out to link:/content/meet-and-hack-alongside-kohsuke-and-co[this weekend's hackathon], but sure to pat him on the back for his tireless efforts.
