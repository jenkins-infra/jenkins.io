Hot on the heels of Hudson 1.370, which was released last Friday, the Hudson team released 1.371 which addresses a *critical vulnerability* in *all* Hudson versions prior to 1.371. The vulnerability was disclosed by https://infradna.com[InfraDNA] in the https://infradna.com/content/security-advisory-2010-08-09[following security advisory], which details the issue:

____
This critical vulnerability allows an attacker to use CLI commands that they are otherwise unauthorized for. CLI commands can perform various administrative operations.
____

It is advised that *all* Hudson instances be upgraded immediately to avoid data loss or other ill effects from this issue. If you're upgrading from a version earlier than 1.370, you can consult the link:/changelog[changelog] for details on the other bug fixes and enhancements covered by the upgrade of your version to 1.371.

If you run a Hudson instance, it is recommended that Hudson system admins subscribe to either the https://feeds.feedburner.com/hudson-security-advisories[security advisories RSS feed] or the link:/mailing-lists/#jenkinsci-advisories-googlegroups-com[advisories@ mailing list]
