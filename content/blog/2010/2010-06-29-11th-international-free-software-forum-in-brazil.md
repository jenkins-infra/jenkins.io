Last week, friend-of-Hudson [Leandro Nunes](https://leandron.wordpress.com/) sent the following message to the `users` [mailing list](https://jenkins.io/content/mailing-lists) regarding his upcoming talk on continuous integration and Hudson:


> Next month I will present [a talk about Hudson](https://verdi.softwarelivre.org/papers_ng/activity/view?activity_id=44) in the 11th
> International Free Software Forum ([FISL 11](https://softwarelivre.org/fisl11)), held in Porto Alegre
> Brazil (detailed time and date of the talk are not yet scheduled so).

FISL 11 is one of the biggest free software events in Latin America and will quite literally attract *thousands* of free software users, hackers, and enthusiasts. It will be held from the 21st to the 24th of July in Porto Alegre, if you're in Central or South America, you should *definitely* try to attend. 


Leandro will have Hudson stickers on hand to give out and will surely do a fantastic job presenting Hudson to all those future Hudson users, I hope you can make it!
