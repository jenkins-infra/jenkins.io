One of my favorite bloggers on the subject of continuous integration, https://twitter.com/builddoctor[The Build Doctor], posed this question in https://www.build-doctor.com/2010/02/23/continuous-integration-in-the-cloud-good-idea/[a recent post]:

Continuous Integration in the cloud: good idea?
____

The topic of running a CI server in a virtualized environment, such as with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon%20Elastic%20Compute%20Cloud[Amazon's EC2 service], is an interesting issue, particularly in the Hudson community. About 10 months ago Kohsuke https://weblogs.java.net/blog/2009/05/18/hudson-ec2-plugin[announced the Hudson EC2 plugin] which has seen slow, but steady development since then, including support for the https://www.ubuntu.com/cloud/private[Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud] which was added to the plugin in a release last Monday.

As The Build Doctor and his readers point out, continuous integration is a difficult task to offload into the cloud because of the immense hardware demands constant building and testing presents. That said, Hudson _does_ very effectively manage spinning agents up and down on demand if you've configured it as such. Implication being: running Hudson in the cloud may be more efficient to meet peak demands without needing to run a large farm of machines.image:https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/hudson_in_the_cloud.png[]

If you're interested in trying out the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Amazon+EC2+Plugin[EC2 plugin], check out https://www.sonatype.com/[Sonatype's] post on https://www.sonatype.com/people/2009/06/nexus-open-source-and-hudson-on-ec2/[Nexus Open Source and Hudson on EC2] might be a good start.

Would you run Hudson in the cloud?
