Rush delivery from Hudson HQ! Hudson 1.351 just rolled out with a **very** important regression fix:

* Regression in 1.350 that can delete old build artifacts. ([mailing list thread](https://n4.nabble.com/Warning-about-Hudson-1-350-Could-delete-your-artifacts-td1593483.html), [issue 5937](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-5937))

Sorry for the hiccup everybody, we're working pretty hard on getting a better, more stable, release process in place.

You can go grab the [latest .war file](http://mirrors.jenkins.io/war-stable/latest/jenkins.war) straight from `hudson-ci.org` or if you're using a native package, use your package manager to upgrade.
