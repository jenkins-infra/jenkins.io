I apologize for the lack of posts this week, I've been quite pre-occupied and a quirk in the https://github.com/rtyler/continuous-blog-tools/blob/master/twipFromSvn.py[twipFromSvn.py] script prevented the generation of this post's contents earlier; thanks to https://twitter.com/rpetti[rpetti] it works again!

This week was an interesting week in plugin development, a slight regression in the release of https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jabber+Plugin[Jabber notifier plugin] 1.7 resulted in the rapid release of a 1.8 release by `kutzi`. The https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Fitnesse+Plugin[Fitnesse plugin] saw multiple releases again this week, along with the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Libvirt+Slaves+Plugin[Libvirt Slaves plugin] which has seen an amazing number of releases since it burst onto the plugin scene link:/content/week-plugins-4[two weeks ago].

There were a few new and notable plugins released this week such as the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/iPhoneView+Plugin[iPhoneView plugin] which adds a fancy view to make checking Hudson all that prettier on an iPhone or iPod Touch, the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/XShell+Plugin[cross-platform shell plugin] was released, aiming to solve the problem of running a job on both Windows and Unix agents. My favorite new plugin release this week has to be the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Gerrit+Plugin[Gerrit plugin] which made its debut and shows a lot of potential to enable the "pre-tested commit" workflow with Git and https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/[Gerrit]
