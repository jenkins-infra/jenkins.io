<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/hudson_street.jpg" align="right" hspace="3" width="150"/> The release of 1.355 came out earlier this week but I hadn't had the chance to write anything up about it. Of course, the work never stops on Hudson so we almost have 1.356 ready to roll out the door, but then Kohsuke tweeted this:

> Because of the data center migration going on, I won't be able to release #hudsonci today.

I won't go into details on some of the infrastructure changes we have lined up just yet, so here's the breakdown of 1.355
<!--break-->

    containers (fixed by removing workaround for a Firefox bug fixed since 3.0.5/Dec2008).

    Fixed build history to indicate test failure for MavenBuild and MavenModuleSetBuild.
  <li class=bug>

</ul>
