Last Friday the Hudson team rolled out a small 1.372 with two enhancements following the *critical* link:/blog/2010/08/10/big-security-fix-hudson-1-371-released/[1.371 release on Monday]. Not a whole lot to say about this release other than go get it!

==== Enhancements

* Persist matrix-based security settings in a consistent order (https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-7138[issue 7138])
* Jobs can now use boolean expression over labels to control where they run.
