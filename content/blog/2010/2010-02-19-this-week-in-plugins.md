Last week's TWIP enumerated the release of **26** different plugin, this past week has seen 19 unique releases in comparison. You might be tempted to assume that *less* plugin development has occurred over the past week, which isn't the case. Last week a number of the releases were "code updates", i.e. plugins being rebuilt against the latest Hudson plugin API as opposed to new features or bug-fixes. With the releases of plugins this past week, it seems a large number of the releases contained new features and bug fixes, including **three new plugins!**

Making their Hudson debut are the following

* [Slave Monitor for system load average](https://plugins.jenkins.io/systemloadaverage-monitor)
* [Tool Environment plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/toolenv)
* [Ivy plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ivy)

If you're interested in contributing to an existing plugin, or building your own, I highly recommend checking out the [plugin tutorial](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Plugin+tutorial) and joining the [dev@ mailing list](https://hudson.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectMailingListList). That said, here are this week's releases, starting with last Friday.
