Regular readers will recognize that I've been slacking off quite a bit lately with my release announcements, my apologies. With the release of 1.368 on Sunday, which fixed a few fairly important bugs, I figured I'd dusty off my blogging fedora and give this a shot.

This release has three bug fixes in it which were causing some issues for some users, particularly those deploying Hudson inside the recently released https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/changelog.html[Tomcat 7.0] (see https://issue-redirect.jenkins.io/issue/6738[issue 6738]).

Hudson users utilizing the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Tool+Auto-Installation[JDK auto-installation] feature between different platforms may have been affected by https://issue-redirect.jenkins.io/issue/6880[issue 6880] which was also fixed in this release.

Bringing up the rear is the fix to https://issue-redirect.jenkins.io/issue/7004[issue 7004] which detailed a few discrepancies between the `/buildWithParameters` and the `/build` remote APIs.

If you're not affected by these issues, you may want to wait for the soon-to-be-released 1.369 which has *even more* juicy bug fixes in it (with a dash of enhancements) to upgrade.
