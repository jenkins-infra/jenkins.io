The Jenkins community congregates in the `#jenkins` channel on the [Freenode](http://www.freenode.net) IRC network.

### Connect

In order to connect to the Freenode network, you can use a local client or the [Freenode web client](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=jenkins) to connect. If you're using an IRC client, connect to the Freenode network ([irc://irc.freenode.net](irc://irc.freenode.net)) and `/join #jenkins`.

### Backlog

The `echelog` bot in the `#jenkins` channel is responsible for logging the conversation for archival purposes, the archives can be [viewed here](http://echelog.matzon.dk/?jenkins)


### Etiquette

"Core" members of the community (such as `kohsuke`) will have "ops" in the channel and most developers will have "voice". 

If you're looking for help, go ahead and *ask* your question, there's plenty of helpful people idling while their builds finish.
