= Update-center Certificate Rotation

**IMPORTANT**

On the 22nd of March 2021, we’ll rotate the update-center certificate. This means that by default any Jenkins version older than 2.178 (April 2018), won’t be able to communicate with the update-center anymore. The update-center usually support version up to one year old. The current oldest stable version supported is https://updates.jenkins-ci.org/2.204/[2.204] which was released in November 2019.

If you don't update regularly, please review the Jenkins https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisories/[security advisories] and use this change as your motivation to update to a more recent Jenkins version.

**What**

Jenkins uses the link:https://updates.jenkins.io/[update center] to identify updates to core and to plugins.
The service signs its metadata with a certificate that is cross-signed by a root certificate.
Jenkins is bundled with the root certificate so it can confirm the authenticity of update center data. 
When updates are available, an alert is shown to Jenkins users that reminds them to update.

**Why**

The root certificate bundled in Jenkins was created in April 2011 and will expire in April 2021.
We prepared for this rotation in April 2018 when we bundled the new root certificate with Jenkins core releases.
It’s now time to use the new root certificate with a new update center certificate. 
The new root certificate will expire in April 2028.


You can follow the work for this certificate rotation in this ticket link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-2902[INFRA-2902]

So again, keep your instance updated and everything should be fine.

See you in 2028,
