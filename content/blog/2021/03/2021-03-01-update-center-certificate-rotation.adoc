= Update-center Certificate Rotation

**IMPORTANT**

On the 22nd of March 2021, we’ll rotate the update-center certificate. This means that by default any Jenkins version older than 2.178 (April 2018), won’t be able to communicate with the update-center anymore. The update-center usually support version up to one year old. The current oldest stable version supported is https://updates.jenkins-ci.org/2.204/[2.204] which was released in November 2019.

If you don't update regularly, please review the Jenkins https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisories/[security advisories] and use this change as your motivation to update to a more recent Jenkins version.

**What**

The update-center is the service used by every Jenkins instance to know which plugin can be updated and where to find the artifacts.It also report if a new Jenkins core version is available. That service uses a self-signed certificate to sign its metadata and that self-signed is cross-signed by a root certificate. Jenkins is bundled with the root certificate so by default it can safely communicate with the update-center. 

**Why**

The root certificate bundled in Jenkins was created in April 2011 and will soon expire in April 2021. We prepared this rotation in April 2018, to have a maximum version of Jenkins bundled with the new root ca certificate. It’s now time to generate a new update-center certificate. The new root certificate will expire in April 2028.


You can follow the work for this certificate rotation in this ticket link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-2902[INFRA-2902]

So again, keep your instance updated and everything should be fine.

See you in 2028,
