= Update-center Certificate Rotation

**IMPORTANT**

On the 22nd of March 2021, we’ll rotate the update-center certificate. This means that by default any Jenkins version older than 2.178 (April 2018), won’t be able to communicate with the update-center anymore. The update-center usually support version up to one year old. The current oldest stable version supported is https://updates.jenkins-ci.org/2.204/[2.204] which was released in November 2019.

If you don't update regularly, please review the Jenkins https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisories/[security advisories] and use this change as your motivation to update to a more recent Jenkins version.

**What**

The update-center is the service used by every Jenkins instance to know which plugin can be updated and where to find the artifacts.It also report if a new Jenkins core version is available. That service uses a self-signed certificate to sign its metadata and that self-signed is cross-signed by a root certificate. Jenkins is bundled with the root certificate so by default it can safely communicate with the update-center. 

**Why**

The root certificate bundled in Jenkins was created in April 2011 and will expire in April 2021.
We prepared for this rotation in April 2018 when we bundled the new root certificate with Jenkins core releases.
It’s now time to use the new root certificate with a new update center certificate. 
The new root certificate will expire in April 2028.


You can follow the work for this certificate rotation in this ticket link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-2902[INFRA-2902]

So again, keep your instance updated and everything should be fine.

See you in 2028,
