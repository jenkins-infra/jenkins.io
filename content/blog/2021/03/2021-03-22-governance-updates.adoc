Here is Ewelina's statement from the elections:

_As a consultant I support my customers with their Jenkins issues since the beginning of 2017.
And almost from the start it was some kind of "as code" approach.
The experience I gained during that time resulted in getting myself involved in the development of Configuration as Code Plugin for Jenkins.
I consider becoming a part of Jenkins Community one of the most valuable experiences in my career so far.
I appreciate how much I have learned and how welcoming the community is._

_I am not a very active contributor these days, at least when it comes to code, but what I have to offer is rather extensive experience
with Jenkins end users - from small, single instance setups to environments with hundreds of controllers run in a different way on different operating systems.
Every day I see challenges those users go through, I know what issues they are facing and which features they consider valuable or missing.
As a Jenkins Governance Board Member I can represent those users._

_Thanks to my involvement in Configuration as Code Plugin development
I had a chance to deliver a number of public presentations 
where I focused on the benefits of the solution and tried to make it easier for newcomers to try it.
Here are a few examples of my activities related to Jenkins Configuration as Code:

https://open.spotify.com/episode/4beEdOeirazc65AdEARIOM?si%3DY63V4gBDT02_UBMQ3vahvg[podcast recording].
So my focus is not only on representing users but also on educating them, and educating myself,
so I actually know what they need and why._

== What's next for the Jenkins Governance Board?

In February we had the link:/blog/2021/02/16/contributor-summit-online/[Jenkins Contributor Summit].
There we discussed many topics related to the Jenkins evolution and its link:/project/roadmap[roadmap].
We identified several initiatives we would like to focus on,
including but not limited to improving user experience, contributor onboarding, and securing Jenkins delivery pipelines.
These initiatives will be a key focus until the next contributor summit we plan to organize in June.
The board will also focus on maintaining the Jenkins governance processes
(meetings, budget approvals, funding, etc.) and facilitating contributions to the project.

== Participating in Jenkins Governance

link:/project/board/[Jenkins Governance Board] has just a representative function in the community.
The project and the community have a long history of open and inclusive governance driven by many contributors.
We invite all community members to participate in the project by joining the
link:/project/governance-meeting/[governance meeting],
participating in the link:/mailing-lists[mailing list] conversations,
and joining link:/sigs[special interest groups] driving particular topics.

See link:/participate[this page] to know more about contributing to Jenkins in general.
