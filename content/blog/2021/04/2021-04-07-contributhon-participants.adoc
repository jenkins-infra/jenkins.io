The link:https://sites.google.com/shecodeafrica.org/contributhon[SheCodeAfrica Contributhon] started April 1, 2021.
The link:https://sites.google.com/shecodeafrica.org/contributhon[SheCodeAfrica Contributhon] is a boot camp where African women are paid to work with open source organizations on selected projects with dedicated mentors.
This program aims to create a more diverse, inclusive, and innovative culture within the African open source ecosystem by matching African women in technology with sponsor and mentor open source organizations.
The 5 mentees joining the Jenkins project come from Nigeria, Kenya, and Rwanda.

The Jenkins project has been accepted as a link:https://sites.google.com/shecodeafrica.org/contributhon/mentor-orgs/accepted-organizations[Contributhon mentoring organization].
Our link:https://sites.google.com/shecodeafrica.org/contributhon/mentor-orgs/accepted-organizations/jenkins[project idea] will introduce mentees to Jenkins and plugin development as they create Pipeline examples and create Pipeline help for Jenkins Pipeline plugins.

Twice weekly mentoring sessions are scheduled with the mentees and are listed in the link:/events[events calendar].
We've already received the first pull request to improve the embedded documentation that generates the link:/doc/pipeline/steps/[Steps Reference] and provides contextual help in the link:/doc/book/pipeline/getting-started/#snippet-generator[Snippet Generator].
We're looking forward to more pull requests and more improvements throughout April, 2021.

We'd like to introduce our mentees so that you recognize them and can welcome them during code review and online chat.
