This year, the Jenkins Contributor Awards will be run by the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF) along with many other link:https://cd.foundation/cdf-community-awards/[CDF Community Awards].

The nominations are currently open and are being accepted using GitHub issues to make the process more transparent. Any contributor is eligible this time around! The deadline to nominate someone is May 14, 2021, and voting will open in May.

Nominate contributors or vote with reactions/comments for all three Jenkins awards:

* link:https://github.com/cdfoundation/foundation/issues/318[Most Valuable Jenkins Contributor]
* link:https://github.com/cdfoundation/foundation/issues/320[Most Valuable Jenkins Advocate]
* link:https://github.com/cdfoundation/foundation/issues/319[Jenkins Security MVP]

The winners will be announced at cdCon 2021, where we're also co-locating the link:/events/contributor-summit/[Jenkins Contributor Summit] on June 25, 2021!


You can also nominate Jenkins community members for global awards like "Top CDF Ambassador" or "Top GitOps Evangelist"!
