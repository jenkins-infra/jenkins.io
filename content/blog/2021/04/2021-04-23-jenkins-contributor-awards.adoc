This year, the Jenkins Contributor Awards will be run by the Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF) along with many other link:https://cd.foundation/cdf-community-awards/[CDF Community Awards].

The nominations are currently open and are being accepted using GitHub issues to make the process more transparent. Any contributor is eligible this time around! The deadline to nominate someone is May 14, 2021, and voting will open in May.
