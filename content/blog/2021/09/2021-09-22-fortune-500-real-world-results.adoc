If you've been following link:https://jenkinsistheway.io/[JenkinsIsTheWay.io], you've read some fantastic stories from the Jenkins user community about the great stuff they are building with Jenkins.
With over 200,000 installations to date, Jenkins remains the most widely used open-source automation server.
And story after story, we hear what a critical role Jenkins plays in building robust, secure CI/CD pipelines.

So it comes as no surprise that in many of the back (and remote) offices of Fortune 500 companies, developers are turning to Jenkins to help make their lives easier with automation while also giving their engineers more time to innovate.
With this in mind, I invite you to read the link:https://jenkinsistheway.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021-Jenkins-Is-The-Way-in-the-Fortune-500-ebook.pdf[latest ebook] focused on the behind-the-scenes development activities underway in large-scale enterprises.

== Jenkins led

Learn how companies like link:https://jenkinsistheway.io/user-story/to-faster-product-release/[IBM] continue to innovate their software prowess while confidently relying on their custom-built CI/CD pipelines.
You'll also read how Jenkins became the ultimate collaboration tool for thousands of link:https://jenkinsistheway.io/user-story/to-produce-ultra-modern-and-sophisticated-electronic-devices/[Apple] developers.
And we don't just shine the spotlight on tech companies.
In link:https://jenkinsistheway.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021-Jenkins-Is-The-Way-in-the-Fortune-500-ebook.pdf[this ebook], Jenkins users span multiple industries across the enterprise.

You'll read how Jenkins made it possible to standardize multidisciplinary team procedures so Roche engineers can create innovative healthcare applications with confidence.
We also dive into how Telstra's software team was able to automate the build cycle - across 100,000 microservices - to accelerate the creation of world-class communication tools.
And how Sainsbury's development team used Jenkins as the way to "bring a retail giant into the 21st century".

== Results inspired

No time to dive into this Fortune 500 ebook?
I thought it's worth highlighting the real-world results experienced by enterprise developers and engineers who have turned to awesome plugins to help build, deploy and automate their software solutions.
Here's what they had to say in their own words!

=== Software acceleration

* Build times are much faster with the new node mechanism
* Shared build pipelines are consistent and evolve faster
* Faster deployment times - from 5 days to several minutes
* Deploy multiple server patches 30x faster than normal processes
* Reduce release time from 7 to 4 days

=== Simpler, smarter processes

* One-stop-shop for building, deploying, monitoring, testing and even self-managing
* Easy onboarding for new applications
* Credential management has gotten much simpler and stricter
* Made setting up CI/CD really easy
* Provides the visibility needed to track the deployment process

=== Loved and relied on by developers

* Ultimate collaboration tool for thousands of developers
* 100% confidence in a consistent and repeatable pipeline
* Keeps the DevOps team in the loop
* Jenkins-as-code has freed teams up to experiment more
* Teams are more self-empowered to provision and support their own builds

One thing to remember is that since Jenkins is a free open source solution, it also means savings across the enterprise.
This is highlighted in several of our user stories in this ebook.
You'll discover how peers have "decreased build server costs" and have mentioned "cost-cutting" as a top Jenkins benefit.
