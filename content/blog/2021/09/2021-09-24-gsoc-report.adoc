Congratulations to all Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2021 students!
On behalf of the Jenkins org team, we would like to thank all participants: students, mentors, applicants, and dozens of other contributors who participated in GSoC this year.

In 2021, the Jenkins project participated in GSoC as part of the link:https://cd.foundation/[Continuous Delivery Foundation's] GSoC mentor organisation.
Within the CDF GSoC mentor organisation, we had six students working on projects: five projects focused on Jenkins
and one project focused on Spinnaker.
In GSoC, we focus on projects that solve problems important to end users and community members.
This year's GSoC projects delivered highly anticipated new features for Jenkins and Spinnaker.

Google Summer of Code has been a successful and positive experience for students due to the active participation of the Jenkins community and the wider Continuous Delivery Foundation community.

=== üéâ All of the CDF GSoC students have successfully completed their projects! üéâ
This is the **second year** in a row that all Jenkins GSoC students have reached the final evaluation and successfully passed!
This has been an extremely challenging year, and the amount of work and dedication that the students and their mentoring teams
have put into GSoC has been phenomenal.
Jenkins, Spinnaker, and the CDF are incredibly grateful to everyone who has contributed to GSoC 2021!

== Upcoming Events, September 28-30: DevOps World!

This year CloudBees, one of the Jenkins corporate sponsors, has invited all students to participate in the link:https://www.devopsworld.com/[DevOps World] virtual conference on September 28-30.
GSoC students will present lighting talks about their projects, attended other conference talks, and join the Continuous Delivery Foundation booth which represents CDF projects at the conference.
We look forward to GSoC students' lightning talks during DevOps World!

== Swag

All Google Summer of Code students and mentors receive swag from Google.
In addition, this year, link:https://www.cloudbees.com/[CloudBees] has sponsored swag for the most active GSoC participants:
all students, mentors, and many other contributors who participated and helped the projects to succeed.
This is the forth year when the Jenkins organization sends extra GSoC swag.
In the previous years swag logistics was one of the more challenging tasks for org admins during GSoC,
and we highly appreciate that the Continuous Delivery Foundation will handle sending out the additional swag.

Thanks you link:https://opensource.google/[Google Open Source], link:https://cd.foundation/[Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF)] and link:https://www.cloudbees.com/[CloudBees]!
