The Jenkins project provides Docker images for controllers, inbound agents, outbound agents, and more.
Beginning with link:/changelog/#v2.307[Jenkins 2.307] released August 17, 2021 and link:/changelog-stable/#v2.303.1[Jenkins 2.303.1] released August 25, 2021, the Docker images provided by the Jenkins project will use Java 11 instead of Java 8.

== Controllers use Java 11 by default

If you are running one of the Jenkins Docker controller images that does not include a JDK version in its label, the Java runtime will switch from Java 8 to Java 11 with the upgrade.

For example:

* Jenkins 2.306 running as `jenkins/jenkins:latest` uses Java 8.
  When Jenkins 2.307 or later is run with `jenkins/jenkins:latest`, it will use Java 11
* Jenkins 2.289.3 running as `jenkins/jenkins:lts` uses Java 8.
  When Jenkins 2.303.1 or later is run with `jenkins/jenkins:lts`, it will use Java 11

The Docker image tags affected by this upgrade include:

* alpine
* centos7
* latest
* lts
* slim

Users that need to remain with Java 8 may use a different Docker image tag to run with Java 8.

* Jenkins 2.306 running as `jenkins/jenkins:latest` uses Java 8.
  When Jenkins 2.307 or later is run with `jenkins/jenkins:latest-jdk8`, it will use Java 8
* Jenkins 2.289.3 running as `jenkins/jenkins:lts` uses Java 8.
  When Jenkins 2.303.1 or later is run with `jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk8`, it will use Java 8

== Agents use Java 11 by default

During the next 1-2 weeks (Aug 17, 2021 - Aug 31, 2021), the Jenkins agent images will be updated to use Java 11 instead of Java 8.

For example:

* Running a Jenkins agent from Docker image `jenkins/jenkins-inbound-agents:4.9-1` uses Java 8.
  When running a Jenkins agent from Docker image `jenkins/jenkins-inbound-agents:4.10-1` it will use Java 11.
* Running a Jenkins agent from Docker image `jenkins/jenkins-inbound-agents:latest` uses Java 8.
  When running a Jenkins agent from Docker image `jenkins/jenkins-inbound-agents:latest` after the agent change, it will use Java 11.

Users that need to remain with Java 8 may use a different Docker image tag to run with Java 8.

* Running a Jenkins agent from Docker image `jenkins/jenkins-inbound-agents:4.9-1` uses Java 8.
  When running a Jenkins agent from Docker image `jenkins/jenkins-inbound-agents:4.10-1-jdk8` it will also use Java 8.

== Docker tag updates stopped

The Jenkins project will no longer update the Docker images that are based on CentOS 8.
The CentOS project has link:https://blog.centos.org/2020/12/future-is-centos-stream/[changed direction to track __just ahead__ of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux release] rather than tracking __after__ a release.
They are no longer publishing updates for CentOS 8 Docker images.

Users running Jenkins 2.306 or earlier with the `jenkins/jenkins:centos` tag will need to switch to use a different tag.
They may consider using:

* `jenkins/jenkins:almalinux`
* `jenkins/jenkins:rhel-ubi8-jdk11`

Users running Jenkins 2.289.3 or earlier with the `jenkins/jenkins:centos` tag will need to switch to use a different tag

They may consider using:

* `jenkins/jenkins:lts-almalinux`
* `jenkins/jenkins:lts-rhel-ubi8-jdk11`

== Window 1809 Docker images stopped

The Windows Docker images have published versions based on both the `1809` feature release and the Windows Server long term support channel ("LTSC").
Windows support for the `1809` images will no longer be published because Microsoft has ended mainstream support for the `1809` images.
Users should switch to use the Jenkins images based on the "LTSC" channel.
