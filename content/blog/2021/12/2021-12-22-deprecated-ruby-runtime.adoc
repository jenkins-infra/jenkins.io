https://github.com/jenkinsci/ruby-runtime-plugin/commit/d368b087fadb3282c9b537f0fa6d9a150b080c73[10 years ago, the Jenkins ruby-runtime was first released]. It was an experiment to let
plugins be written in ruby but still get integrated into the main
Java Virtual Machine runtime with help of link:https://www.jruby.org/[JRuby].
A similar extension was made to allow plugins to be written in Python but still integrated into the Java Virtual Machine with link:https://www.jython.org/[Jython].

Over the years though, the experiments are no longer being maintained and the
plugins that use the non-Java runtimes take a lot of compatibility effort.
In addition, the Jenkins ruby runtime does not support Java 11.
Specifically, the last few years have been really hard on the Jenkins
core developers, as they still have to maintain all the hacks and
processes to keep the non-Java runtimes barely working.
Examples of the experienced issues include compatibility with jep:200[Switch Remoting/XStream blocklist to a permitlist] where we had to allow many Ruby Runtime classes in the Jenkins core to support serialization of data.

In 2018 we discussed the future of the Ruby Runtime based plugins.
There was a consensus that we want to deprecate and remove the plugins so that Jenkins users do not experience issues .
link:/blog/authors/daniel-beck/[Daniel Beck] created jep:7[Deprecation of ruby-runtime] for that.
Over the years, the functionality provided by Ruby plugins has been largely replaced by other implementations,
and hence we have decided to proceed with the deprecation
(link:https://groups.google.com/u/1/g/jenkinsci-dev/c/Ve0fqAud3Mk/m/lVejhAjNAQAJ[discussion]).

One month from now, January 22nd, 2022, the link:https://updates.jenkins.io/[default Jenkins update center] will stop distributing
the plugin:ruby-runtime[Ruby runtime plugin], the link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/ruby-runtime/#dependencies[plugins] that use the Ruby runtime, the plugin:python-wrapper[Python runtime plugin], and the link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/python-wrapper/#dependencies[plugin] that uses the Python runtime.

== What does this mean for you?

If you are one of the few users who are using the following plugins, there will be no impact on your existing instances. The
only change will come for new installs. Suspended plugins will stay
installed, but can not be newly installed without manually downloading
releases or using custom update centers.

Jenkins plugin management tools and distributions may be affected as well if they use the default update center to download the plugins and/or their metadata.
It includes but is not limited to the official link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker[Docker images],
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/helm-charts[Helm charts],
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkinsfile-runner[Jenkinsfile Runner],
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/custom-war-packager/[Custom Jenkins WAR Packager],
and the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool[Plugin Installation Manager CLI Tool].
Note that all these tools allow custom update sites to be configured if required.

The lists below provide additional information about the plugins based on the Ruby Runtime and the Python Runtime.
Please plan your transition away from these plugins.
They will be removed from the official Jenkins update centers on January 22, 2022.

== Acknowledgements

We would like to thank all contributors and maintainers who contributed to the Ruby Runtime based plugins and the Python Runtime based plugin.
We also thank those who participated in development of new plugins replacing the functionality.
These contributors helped millions of Jenkins users while the ecosystem was supported over the past 10 years
and it is not taken for granted.
Now we need to move on so that we can keep expanding the Jenkins architecture and developers tools.
We invite all contributors to participate in this effort and to help us to migrate the plugins to supported JVM-based platforms for plugins.

== My instance is affected, what to do next?

If you do not use the affected plugins, the recommendation is to remove them.
Otherwise, it is recommended to start migration out of the plugins to alternatives providing similar functionality.

Not all plugins have alternatives.
At the moment the Jenkins core team does not plan to provide a replacement, but any contributions are welcome.
If you depend on the functionality,
we recommend reaching out to the community in the link:/mailing-lists/[developer mailing list] so that
you can coordinate the replacement with other affected users.
