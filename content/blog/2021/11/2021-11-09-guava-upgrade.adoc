== Summary

Jenkins bundles https://guava.dev/[Guava], a core Java library from Google.
Beginning with Jenkins 2.320 (released on November 10, 2021), Jenkins has upgraded the Guava library from
link:https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v11.0.1[11.0.1] (released on January 9, 2012) to
link:https://github.com/google/guava/releases/tag/v31.0.1[31.0.1] (released on September 27, 2021).
Plugins have already been prepared to support the new version of Guava in link:https://issues.jenkins.io/issues/?jql=labels%20in%20(JEP-233)[JEP-233].
**Use the Plugin Manager to upgrade all plugins before _and_ after upgrading to Jenkins 2.320.**

== Motivation

Many security-conscious organizations using, or planning to use, Jenkins run off-the-shelf security scanners to look for known vulnerabilities.
These commonly flag the obsolete Guava library as susceptible to a serialization-related vulnerability (https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/CVE-2018-10237[CVE-2018-10237]) and recommend upgrading.
While Jenkins uses link:/blog/2018/03/15/jep-200-lts/[JEP-200] to form an explicit list of allowed classes for deserialization,
and the two Guava classes affected by CVE-2018-10237 are not and will never be added to the list,
it is time-consuming for the link:/security/team/[security team] to respond to purported security reports
and for users to justify exemptions from policy to use Jenkins anyway.

Furthermore, the decade-old version of Guava has long been a maintenance burden for Jenkins developers.
In a world where Dependabot offers upgrades to libraries released just hours before,
it is unpleasant to be working with dependencies that are many years old.

For more information, see https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/233/README.adoc[JEP-233].

== Upgrading

The vast majority of plugins have already been prepared to support the new version of Guava in link:https://issues.jenkins.io/issues/?jql=labels%20in%20(JEP-233)[JEP-233].
Jenkins users need only upgrade plugins to compatible versions as documented in the "Released As" field in Jira.
**It is critical to use the Plugin Manager to upgrade all plugins before _and_ after upgrading to Jenkins 2.320.**
Failure to upgrade plugins to compatible versions may result in `ClassNotFoundException`, `NoClassDefFoundError`, or other low-level Java errors.

== Reporting issues

If you find a regression in a plugin, please file a bug report in Jira:

* link:https://issues.jenkins.io/issues/?jql=labels%20in%20(JEP-233)%20and%20status%20not%20in%20(resolved%2C%20closed)[Open JEP-233 issues]

When reporting an issue, include the following information:

. Use the `JEP-233` label.
. Provide the _complete_ list of installed plugins as suggested in the link:/doc/book/system-administration/diagnosing-errors/#how-to-report-a-bug[bug reporting guidelines].
. Provide the _complete_ stack trace, if relevant.
. Provide steps to reproduce the issue _from scratch_ on a minimal Jenkins installation; the scenario should fail when the steps are followed on Jenkins 2.320 or later and pass when the steps are followed on Jenkins 2.319 or earlier.

If you maintain a Jenkins plugin with an open JEP-233 issue,
then please check if there is a pull request awaiting merge or release.
If you use an unmaintained Jenkins plugin with an open JEP-233 issue,
consider stepping up and link:/doc/developer/plugin-governance/adopt-a-plugin/[adopting the plugin] to release a compatible version.

== Conclusion

We expect to see a bit of disruption from these changes
but hope that in the long run they will save time for core and plugin developers
and lead to a more secure and stable tool.
Please reach out on the link:/mailing-lists/[developers' list] with any questions or suggestions.
