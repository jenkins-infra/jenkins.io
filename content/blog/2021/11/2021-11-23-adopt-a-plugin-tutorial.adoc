Many new contributors may hesitate to adopt a Jenkins plugin.
They may be concerned that the time commitment is too great.
They may be worried that they lack the technical skills to maintain a plugin.
They may not feel adequate to handle issues related to a Jenkins plugin.

This blog post introduces the "Adopt a plugin" developer tutorial for new contributors.
The tutorial is a result of the "Contributing to Open Source" workshop (link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PKYIpPlRVGsBqrz0Ob1Cv3cefOZ5j2xtGZdWs27kLuw/edit?usp=sharing[document], link:https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jk8kxC0R59YNO7fY7akx2zmn07WTsZwJo5Ub0khoO0w/edit?usp=sharing[slides], and video) that was held at DevOps World 2021.

== Small steps

A series of small steps can help new contributors develop the confidence that they can adopt a Jenkins plugin.
Each of the steps is valuable even if the new contributor decides that they do not want to adopt the plugin.
Each of the steps will assist the maintainers of the plugin.

The steps include:

* Add a Jenkinsfile
* Update the parent pom
* Update base Jenkins version
* Enable additional spotbugs checks
* Update the SCM URL
* Enable dependabot for dependency management
* Enable incrementals
* Enable release drafter
* Migrate documentation to GitHub
* Improve Pipeline online help and documentation
* Convert common API dependencies to plugin dependencies
* Add a link to “Report an Issue”
