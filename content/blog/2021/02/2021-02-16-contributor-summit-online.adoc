The Jenkins Contributor Summit brings together current and future contributors to the Jenkins project.
We're hosting an online summit this year to encourage contributors from around the world to meet, discuss, and plan for the future.

The Contributor Summit will be **Tuesday, February 23rd 2021 through Thursday, February 25, 2021**.
The summit brings together community members to learn, meet, and help shape the future of Jenkins.
In the Jenkins community we value all types and sizes of contributions and love to welcome new participants.

== Format

The online format allows greater flexibility for meeting times and topics.
Contributors will meet to discuss specific topics in smaller groups at times that are convenient for those in the meeting.

=== Opening session

The opening session will start Tuesday, February 23, 2021 at 15:00 UTC.
After an initial welcome and overview, we'll hear from leaders in the Jenkins project as they share the results from the previous 12 months and outline ideas for the next 12 months.

After those presentations, we'll create "breakout rooms" in the online meeting that will allow those interested in specific tracks to meet, identify preferred times for their tracks, and prepare draft agendas for their tracks.

=== Tracks

Smaller sessions ("tracks") will be run in the 48 hour period between the opening session and the closing session.
These smaller sessions will be focused on specific topics.
A track leader will organize the track meeting, facilitate discussions in the track meeting, and present a summary of the track results in the closing session.

=== Closing session

The opening session will start Thursday, February 25, 2021 at 15:00 UTC.
After an initial welcome and overview, we'll hear from track leaders as they share the results from their track meetings.

We'll identify items that should be added to the link:/project/roadmap/[Jenkins roadmap], items that should be further investigated by link:/sigs/[special interest groups], and items that need further discussion elsewhere.
