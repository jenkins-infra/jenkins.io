Beginning with Jenkins 2.279 and Jenkins 2.263.4, the Jenkins project is upgrading the base operating system and Java version used in the `jenkins/jenkins:latest` and `jenkins/jenkins:lts` images.
The update replaces OpenJDK 8u242 with AdoptOpenJDK 8u282 and replaces Debian 9 (link:https://www.debian.org/releases/stretch/["Stretch"]) with Debian 10 (link:https://www.debian.org/releases/buster/["Buster"]).

== Why?

We're changing the base image so that we have a better supported operating system and a more current Java release for Jenkins controllers.

=== Better supported operating system

The Docker images provided by the Jenkins project rely on the operating system security processes of the operating system provider.

Our Docker images have used Debian 9 (link:https://www.debian.org/releases/stretch/["Stretch"]) for multiple years.
Debian 9 security updates have been link:https://www.debian.org/releases/stretch/[discontinued as of July 6, 2020].
Debian 9 Long Term Support security updates will be discontinued at the link:https://www.debian.org/releases/stretch/[end of June 2022].
The upgrade to Debian 10 keeps us on an operating system maintained by the operating system security team.

=== More current Java release

The Debian 9 Docker images were based on the link:https://hub.docker.com/layers/openjdk/library/openjdk/8-jdk-stretch/images/sha256-6896e96ce729fd54da25b8d831400773efeef39780c65bffb2d64c1412189455[`openjdk:8-jdk-stretch` Docker image].
The last update to that image was one year ago with the release of JDK 8u242.
We need a maintained Docker base image that keeps pace with JDK releases and operating system updates so that the controller is running the most recent Java updates and most recent operating system updates.

Other Jenkins controller images have already switched from using `openjdk` base images to instead use base images provided by link:https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/adoptium[Eclipse Adoptium].
link:https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/adoptium[Eclipse Adoptium] is the Eclipse project formed when link:https://blog.adoptopenjdk.net/2020/06/adoptopenjdk-to-join-the-eclipse-foundation/[AdoptOpenJDK joined the Eclipse Foundation].
This change adapts the `jenkins/jenkins:latest` and `jenkins/jenkins:lts` images to use the Adoptium JDK images in the same pattern as is already used for the Jenkins JDK 11 Docker images like `jenkins/jenkins:lts-jdk11`.
The Jenkins Platform SIG has enjoyed very good results in our interactions with the Eclipse Adoptium project.
We look forward to continuing our collaboration with them.

Thanks a lot to link:/blog/authors/slide_o_mix/[Alex Earl] and link:https://github.com/james-crowley[Jim Crowley] for the image build restructuring groundwork that made the image upgrade possible!
Also thanks to link:/blog/authors/oleg_nenashev/[Oleg Nenashev] and other contributors for their reviews and testing.

== Packaging changes

The Jenkins Docker image based on Debian 10 ("Buster") includes some different packages than Debian 9 ("Stretch").
Some packages have been removed because they are no longer supported by their communities.
Some packages have been removed due to infrequent and decreasing use.
Users of the Jenkins Docker images may need to extend their definition of their Docker image to include packages that are no longer included in the base image.

=== SCM packages removed

The following source control management packages are no longer included in the Jenkins controller images for `jenkins/jenkins:latest` or for `jenkins/jenkins:lts`:

* bzr
* mercurial
* subversion

=== Other packages removed

Additional packages that are no longer included in the Jenkins controller images include:

* bzip2
* mime-support
* python (the Python project stopped supporting Python 2 January 1, 2020)
* xz-utils

A detailed list of the exact package changes is available in the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker/pull/1070[pull request].

== Upgrade and compatibility notes

The Jenkins controller images are designed to be extended to meet user needs.
Custom Jenkins controller images can be created from the base images and are designed to allow additional Jenkins plugins and additional operating system packages.

For example, the link:/doc/book/installing/docker/[Installing Docker] instructions illustrate a technique to install the plugin:blueocean[Blue Ocean plugins] and some operating system packages in a custom Docker image.

=== Docker image with Subversion

The following Docker image definition installs the most recent link:/download/lts/[Jenkins Long Term Support] release with the plugin:subversion[subversion plugin] and the operating system `subversion` command:

[source]
----
FROM jenkins/jenkins:lts
USER root
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends subversion
USER jenkins
RUN jenkins-plugin-cli --plugins subversion:2.14.0
----

Build a new docker image from this Dockerfile and assign the image a meaningful name, e.g. "myjenkins-subversion:1.1":

[source,bash]
----
docker build -t myjenkins-subversion:1.1 .
----

=== Docker image with Mercurial

The following Docker image definition installs the most recent link:/download/weekly/[Jenkins Weekly] release with the plugin:mercurial[mercurial plugin] and the operating system `hg` command:

[source]
----
FROM jenkins/jenkins:latest
USER root
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends mercurial
USER jenkins
RUN jenkins-plugin-cli --plugins mercurial:2.12
----

Build a new docker image from this Dockerfile and assign the image a meaningful name, e.g. "myjenkins-mercurial:1.1":

[source,bash]
----
docker build -t myjenkins-mercurial:1.1 .
----

== What's next?

We will continue Docker image updates as new Java versions are released.

If you are interested in new features in Jenkins Docker packaging,
stay tuned for future announcements!
There are multiple ongoing initiatives which you can find on the link:/project/roadmap/[public Jenkins roadmap].
Some stories:

- Switching to AdoptOpenJDK.
- General availability of Windows images.
- Support for more platforms (AArch64, IBM s390x, PowerPC).
- Introducing multi-platform Docker images.

If you are interested in any of these projects and would like to contribute,
please reach out to the link:/sigs/platform[Platform Special Interest Group] which coordinates initiatives related to Jenkins in Docker.
