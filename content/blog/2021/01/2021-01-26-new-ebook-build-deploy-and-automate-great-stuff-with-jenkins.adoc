In April of last year, we launched a new Jenkins community website called https://jenkinsistheway.io/[JenkinsIsTheWay].
The Jenkins Is The Way site has collected the experiences of Jenkins users around the world as they develop software and create solutions.
They are charting new paths, discovering new opportunities, and overcoming challenges.

That's what makes Jenkins Is The Way tick.
Engineers in the Netherlands might have already met challenges faced by developers in India.
Solutions uncovered by DevOps teams in Spain may benefit those just starting in the USA.
Interns in Bogota may develop pipeline solutions that can be integrated into workflows used across the globe in Tokyo.
Or vice versa!

No matter where you are, regardless of whether your solution is regional or global in nature, Jenkins Is The Way.

== Telling your stories in a new eBook

To date, we have nearly 60 user stories, a handful of case studies, and some new user testimonial videos from the Jenkins community.
You shared how using Jenkins has helped make your builds faster, your pipelines more secure, and your developers and software engineers happier.
In essence, Jenkins Is The Way showcases how Jenkins has made it a whole lot easier to do the work you do every day.

We've now gathered some of those stories in our first https://jenkinsistheway.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Jenkins-User-Story-Industry-focused-ebook-2020.pdf[Jenkins Is The Way ebook], covering various challenges and solutions from six different industries: Aerospace, Education, Finance, Insurance, Retail, and Travel.

You'll read about innovations from *KP Labs* in Poland and *Preply* in Ukraine.
You'll discover how automation helped *Avoris* out of Spain & Portugal and *Tymit* in the United Kingdom.
And you'll be inspired by what China's *JD.com* and *Topdanmark* in Denmark were able to achieve after tapping into the Jenkins community.

This curated collection of stories illustrates how Jenkins community members build next-generation DevOps and CI/CD platforms as the backbone for software innovation across companies of all sizes.
They highlight the innovation, ingenuity, and keen ability to adapt Jenkins plugins to handle everyday business issues, everywhere.

The technology landscape is full of solutions perfected to tackle all aspects of software development.
But time and time again, developers keep coming back to Jenkins.
Your engineering time and resources are too valuable to be spent re-inventing the wheel or handling manual testing and deployment cycles.

Jenkins' vast array of plugins and pre-built solutions will have you automating more than you ever imagined.
So, get inspired to build great stuff with Jenkins.
