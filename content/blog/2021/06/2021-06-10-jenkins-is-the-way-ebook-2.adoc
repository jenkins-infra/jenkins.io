A little over a year ago, we launched JenkinsIsTheWay.io, a website whose sole purpose is to share Jenkins user stories with the developers and engineers in our community.  Over a hundred of you have already link:https://stories.jenkins.io[shared your innovations], and they just keep coming.  It comes as no surprise that many of the submitted stories are from IT consultants and software developers around the world building next-generation DevOps and CI/CD platforms to fuel the modernization of enterprise companies far and wide.

That’s why we’ve dedicated link:https://stories.jenkins.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-Jenkins-User-Story-IT-focused-ebook.pdf[our latest eBook] to focus on Jenkins users in the global Information Technology sector.  We shine the spotlight on these developers and engineers who have solved unique software development and DevOps challenges by turning to the leading open source automation server.  From powering large enterprises needing a better way to manage their inventory to innovative tech firms looking to advance technologies and healthcare initiatives during a pandemic, you’ll read about how teams everywhere solved their unique challenges — with the help of Jenkins. 

=== Jenkins is the Way to…

In our link:https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JenkinsIsTheWay[short User Story Survey], we ask Jenkins users to fill in the blank: Jenkins is the way to ......

We've seen results-oriented submissions like "Jenkins is the way to link:https://stories.jenkins.io/user-story/to-deliver-our-new-releases-on-time/[deliver our new releases on time]!" and "Jenkins is the way to link:https://stories.jenkins.io/user-story/to-understand-and-simplify-your-software-workflows-2/[understand and simplify your software workflows]."  Several submissions riffed off of something like "Jenkins is the way to link:https://stories.jenkins.io/user-story/to-completely-automate-your-ci-cd-workflow/[completely automate your CI/CD workflow]."  Meanwhile, others have had a bit more fun and languished praise on Jenkins, stating, "Jenkins is the way to link:https://stories.jenkins.io/user-story/to-help-teams-focus-on-what-is-really-important/[help teams focus on what is really important], link:https://stories.jenkins.io/user-story/to-make-our-life-easier/[make our life easier]" and, even, "Jenkins is the way to link:https://stories.jenkins.io.io/user-story/to-save-the-day/[save the day]."

In this new eBook, we focus on the challenges users in the community face, and what they’ve built using Jenkins to achieve their unique goals. For example, Build & Release Manager, Donald Morton, turned to Jenkins to establish link:https://stories.jenkins.io/user-story/to-build-industry-leading-log-management/[a flexible, modern, and more efficient DevOps platform] for Graylog, a leading log management platform serving the enterprise.

With a Jenkins assist, Mark Baumann, DevOps Engineer with ITK Engineering, created “link:https://stories.jenkins.io/user-story/to-tackle-any-challenge/[one CI to rule them all].” He told us that “Jenkins provides a common CI/CD platform for all different kinds of projects and technology domains.”

When IBM Lead Software Engineer Alec Rieger sought to simplify the build and testing pipeline for the company's software engineers and developers, he also turned to Jenkins.  For a company the size of IBM, which services enterprise clients worldwide, Rieger wanted to help his colleagues manage many nodes on a large scale. Now, according to his link:https://stories.jenkins.io/user-story/to-keep-ibm-always-on/[Jenkins Is The Way user story], IBM uses Jenkins pipelines for each of their builds and relies on the flexibility and countless plugin features to continually improve their processes.

=== Stronger, Smarter, Faster Software Innovation

While we all fondly think of Jenkins as a modest butler who has empowered developers with the open-source tools they need to succeed — on JenkinsIsTheWay.io, we liken him to an unpretentious, yet powerful superhero.  And like any great superhero, he (or she!) is sure to save the day. 


For our Jenkins users, that means results — significant, measurable results with a common theme.  Using Jenkins has enabled you — the user — to help the businesses you serve save money, spin up software faster, and automate processes.  In doing so, you've freed up developers and engineers from countless hours of mundane tasks.  Thanks to Jenkins, you’re empowering entire IT teams to innovate, focus on what they love to do and, ultimately, build great stuff.

Of course, we devote much of our link:https://stories.jenkins.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-Jenkins-User-Story-IT-focused-ebook.pdf[latest eBook] to those victories.  Results like how RedHat’s link:https://stories.jenkins.io/user-story/to-build-and-release-faster/[releases are 5x faster] thanks to Jenkins.  The fact that DevOps problem tickets were link:https://stories.jenkins.io/user-story/to-automate-everything/[reduced by over 90%] for Electronic Health Solutions.  And why the CTO at Cloudologia was link:https://stories.jenkins.io/user-story/to-experiments-and-eternity/[psyched to share] that — with a Jenkins at the helm — they were able to shorten onboarding for deployment & build release cycles from one week to a single day.

=== Share Your User Story, Too!

I am proud to share another common theme from the users who have submitted their story:  you turn to our community for collaboration, guidance, and advice.  A community of a million strong and growing, link:https://stories.jenkins.io/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-Jenkins-User-Story-IT-focused-ebook.pdf[this eBook] and link:https://stories.jenkins.io/[stories.jenkins.io] are other ways to provide you with the insight and lessons learned by developers and engineers, like you, to innovate and build next-generation technologies for companies of all sizes.

When you're ready to tell your story, we're prepared to help you share it.  link:https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JenkinsIsTheWay[Fill out our short questionnaire], and we'll send you our Jenkins Is The Way T-shirt as a thank you once it’s published!
