---

Keeping up with our goal to clean up some of the technical debt inside Jenkins Core, we are happy to report we were able to remove a long-deprecated library.

link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5320[Jenkins does not depend anymore] on link:https://search.maven.org/artifact/commons-digester/commons-digester/2.1/jar[commons-digester:2.1], a version that has been released in 2010.

Here is the list of plugins that did _not_ have their fix released at the time of writing.
They will start to break with the weekly on the 7th of June, expected to be the 2.297.

[NOTE]
====
It is always a good idea to update all your plugins _before_ upgrading Jenkins core.
