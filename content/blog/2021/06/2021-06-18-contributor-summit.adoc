The Jenkins Contributor Summit brings together current and future contributors to the Jenkins project.
We're hosting an online summit this year to encourage contributors from around the world to meet, discuss, and plan for the future.

The Contributor Summit will be **Friday, June 25, 2021**.
In the Jenkins community we value all types and sizes of contributions and love to welcome new participants.

== Agenda

Project Updates::

The Summit will open June 25, 2021 at 9:00 AM Easern time (1:00 PM UTC) with project updates from Tracy Miranda of the Continuous Delivery Foundation and updates from many of the Jenkins officers.
We look forward to reports from the Jenkins Governance Board and from many of the Jenkins officers.

Special Interest Group Leaders::

The leaders of several Jenkins Special Interest Group will present the latest results and share the plans for the future.

Contributor Tracks::

We'll separate into contributor tracks for two hours of focused discussions on specific topics.
Participants are encouraged to choose the tracks where they can be most helpful for the Jenkins projects.
The final set of tracks will be announced at the summit and are expected to include:
