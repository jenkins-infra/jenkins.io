---

Keeping up with our goal to clean up some of the technical debt inside Jenkins Core and reduce the maintenance overheads, we are happy to report we were able to remove a long-deprecated Apache Commons Digester library.

link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/5320[Jenkins Core does not depend anymore] on link:https://search.maven.org/artifact/commons-digester/commons-digester/2.1/jar[Apache Commons Digester v.2.1], a version that has been released in 2010.

Some plugins will require update to operate properly after the Jenkins core upgrade.
See https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/231[JEP-231] for the full list of the affected plugins.
Below there is the list of plugins that did _not_ have their fix released at the time of writing.
They will start to break with the weekly on the 7th of June, expected to be the 2.297.

In addition to these still-served plugins, a few others will break.
Note however that these were _already_ suspended footnote:[this means these plugins are not served anymore by the Jenkins Project's hosting service.
Even if they were released, the releases would not show up until additional issues are fixed.] for various reasons, so we do recommend to move away from using them or step up as maintainers.
The IDs for these plugins are: `tfs`, `svn-release-mgr`, `cpptest`, `cflint`, `script-scm`, `rtc`.

[NOTE]
====
It is always a good idea to update all your plugins _before_ upgrading Jenkins core.

=== Getting fixes in the affected plugins

For all affected plugins we have submitted pull requests with compatibility patches.
These plugins seem to have no active maintainer, and hence we cannot commit on delivering those fixes.
In mean time you can build a custom patch locally to resolve the issue on your instances.
If you use any of those plugins, consider stepping up and link:/doc/developer/plugin-governance/adopt-a-plugin/[adopting] them so that the fixes could be released.
We will appreciate any contributions!
