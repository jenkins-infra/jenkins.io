This blog post is for anyone interested to know how to configure a plugin using the Jenkins Configuration as a Code (JCasC) plugin, more specifically, this blog will guide you to get the YAML equivalent of a plugin’s configuration and use it to do some changes to the plugin without using the Jenkins UI.

If you’re a beginner at JCasC and want to learn more about it, you can head over to the following resources to understand JCasC better:

* link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/configuration-as-code/[JCasC Documentation]
* link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTzljM-EDjI[Overview of JCasC (Video Presentation)]

== Overview

So, these are the steps we will be following to achieve our aim:

. <<Brief Introduction to jenkins.yaml file>>
. <<Configure the plugin on the UI>>
. <<Download the Configuration>>
. <<Update JCasC file locally>>
. <<Load the jenkins.yaml file on the Jenkins server>>
. <<Verify the changes on the UI>>

'''

== Brief Introduction to jenkins.yaml file

- The `jenkins.yaml` file contains the configuration of the Jenkins instance in YAML format.
The JCasC plugin refers to this file to configure the Jenkins instance.
- The default location of `jenkins.yaml` is `$JENKINS_HOME/jenkins.yaml`, from where it can be fetched into the Jenkins server whenever you apply a new configuration.
- Download your `jenkins.yaml` file by going to `Manage Jenkins` > `Configuration as Code` > `Download Configuration`.
- Make sure this file is saved at location `$JENKINS_HOME/jenkins.yaml`.
- Let's change the `systemMessage` field to:

- Reload the existing configuration to apply the system message change
- Now, go back to the Dashboard and you can see the updated System Message on top:

.Viewing the changes on Dashboard

- This file will be used later to configure the plugin using JCasC.

'''

== Configure the plugin on the UI

- For this demo, install the `View Job Filters` plugin.
- Let’s create a view by clicking on the `New View` option on the left side of the Dashboard.
- Give it a name (say, “testView”) and set its type to `List View`, and click on the `OK` button.

.Creating the View

- Now click on `Add Job Filter` to add any kind of filter, so let’s select `Build Duration Filter` and fill the field with any value (say, "60" minutes),

.Adding filter to the view

- Click on `Apply` > `Save`.
- To view the full configuration, check out your main `jenkins.yaml` configuration file, by clicking on `Manage Jenkins` > `Configuration as Code` > `View Configuration`
- Go to the `views` section in this YAML file to see details related to the view,

.Here, details regarding the view (which we just created) is visible

'''

== Download the Configuration

- Now that you have successfully configured your plugin by UI, let’s download the configuration by going to `Manage Jenkins` on the Dashboard, then click on `Configuration as Code` under "System Configuration".
- Now click on the `Download Configuration` button to save the configuration file locally.

.Downloading the Configuration

'''

== Update JCasC file locally

- Add some changes in your downloaded copy of the `jenkins.yaml` file, to see those changes being automatically reflected on the UI.
- For demo purposes, let’s change the `name` to “YoutubeDemoView” and set the `buildDurationMinutes` as "55".

.Changing the View details locally
image::/images/post-images/2021-05-15-configure-plugins-with-jcasc/yaml-file-on-local-text-editor.png[YAML file on Text Editor, width=750px]

- Save the file.

'''

== Load the jenkins.yaml file on the Jenkins server

- Now to reflect the local changes done in the `jenkins.yaml` file onto the Jenkins server, click on the `Reload existing configuration` button.

.Applying the New Configuration to the Jenkins instance

'''

== Verify the changes on the UI

- Go back to the main page by clicking on the Jenkins logo on the top-left side.
- And you will notice that the name of your view has been changed from "testView" to “YoutubeDemoView”,
- And the field value of `Build Duration Filter` has been changed from "60" to “55”.
- These two are the exact changes that we did locally in our `jenkins.yaml` file.

.Verifying the changes

Congratulations! You’ve successfully configured a plugin (“View Job Filter”) automatically with the help of the “Jenkins Configuration as Code” plugin! You can repeat the same process for other plugins as well.
