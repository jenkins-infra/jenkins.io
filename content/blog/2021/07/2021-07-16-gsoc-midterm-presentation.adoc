Congratulations to all GSoC students who have made it through the first half of the GSoC 2021 coding phase!

This year, the Jenkins project has been participating in GSoC as part of the Continuous Delivery Foundation's GSoC org.
To celebrate our GSoC students and the fantastic work they have been doing, the CDF is hosting an online meetup where students will present their work.
Students will be showcasing what they have learned and accomplished thus far in GSoC, demoing their work, and discussing their goals and plans for the second coding phase.

The CDF Google Summer of Code Midterm Demos will be held online on July 20th, 13:00 UTC - 15:00 UTC.

==== Title: Jenkins Remoting Monitoring with OpenTelemetry

In this talk, he will discuss the problems in maintaining Jenkins agents and how to support Jenkins admins in troubleshooting them.
As one of the solutions, he will introduce the new Remoting monitoring with OpenTelemetry plugin that collects Jenkins Remoting monitoring data and troubleshooting data using OpenTelemetry.
What kind of data the plugin will collect and how we will be able to visualize them using available open-source monitoring tools will be demonstrated.

=== Shruti Chaturvedi - link:/projects/gsoc/2021/projects/cloudevents-plugin[CloudEvents Plugin for Jenkins]

==== Title: CloudEvents Plugin for Jenkins: Moving Towards Interoperability

In this talk, we will look at interoperability as an essential element in building workloads across several services.
We will also talk about how CloudEvents solves one of the biggest challenges in achieving interoperability between systems: lack of normalization/standardization.
Without any standard definition, in order to achieve interoperability, services have to develop adapters specific to a particular system.
That, however, is complex because services are always changing the way data/events are emitted.
CloudEvents solves this problem by defining a standard format for events, which can be emitted/consumed agnostically, thereby achieving indirect interoperability.
Shruti will demonstrate the workings of CloudEvents Plugin for Jenkins; she will walk us through how Jenkins can be configured as a source and a sink, emitting and consuming CloudEvents-compliant events in a platform-independent manner.

==== Title: try.spinnaker.io:  Explore Spinnaker in a Sandbox Environment!

The talk will go through a brief explanation of Spinnaker and the challenges that users face during the installation process.
He will discuss the infrastructure of this project and how a public multi tenant spinnaker instance will be managed and installed.
We will end with a demo of the site so far and the various features implemented, including Github authentication, K8s manifest deployment, AWS Load Balancer Controller to expose deployments, private ECR registry and the blocking of all public images, and auto resource cleanup.

==== Title: Conventional Commits Plugin for Jenkins

In this talk, we'll start with what are conventional commits and why they are needed.
Then we'll see what the jenkins plugin, "Conventional Commits" is and what goal it is trying to achieve.
A demo of how the plugin can be used/integrated in the current workflow will be shown.
Finally, we'll talk about the next steps in plugin development followed by the QnA.

In this talk, he will give an overview of the project and will move on further explaining what problems are being faced, a bit about the workaround that are being used to tackle the problems,
what makes the authentication support so important, why a feature and not a plugin in itself, accomplishments achieved and work done during the coding phase 1, will talk about the implementation of the feature, demonstration of git authentication support over HTTP protocol.
