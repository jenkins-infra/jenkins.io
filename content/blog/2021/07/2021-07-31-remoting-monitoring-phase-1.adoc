== Goal

image:/images/post-images/2021-07-31-remoting-monitoring-phase-1/goal.png[Goal of Remoting Monitoring with OpenTelemetry, align="center", width=700]

*The goal of this project:*

* collect telemetry data(metrics, traces, logs) of remoting module with
OpenTelemetry.
* send the telemetry data to OpenTelemetry Protocol endpoint

Which OpenTelemetry endpoint to use and how to visualize the data are up to
users.

*An observability framework for cloud-native software*

____
OpenTelemetry is a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs.
You can use it to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry
data(metrics, logs, and traces) for analysis in order to understand your
software's performance and behavior.
____

== Phase 1 summary

=== User survey

Our team conducted a user survey to understand the pain point regarding Jenkins
remoting.

.Fig 1. What agent type/plugins do you use?
[caption="Figure 1:"]
image:/images/post-images/2021-07-31-remoting-monitoring-phase-1/user-survey.png[End user survey result, width=700]

Fig 1 shows what types of agent users use, and 17 unique respondents out of
28 use docker for agent. So I'm planning to publish a docker image to
demonstrate how we can build Docker image with our monitoring feature.

This survey and investigation of JIRA tickets of past two years also tell me five
common causes of agent unavailability.

* *Configuration mistakes*
** Jenkins agent settings, e.g. misuse of "tunnel connection through" option.
** Platform settings, e.g. invalid port setting of Kubernetes' helm template.
** Network settings, e.g. Load balancer misconfiguration.
* *Uncontrolled shutdown of nodes* for downscaling.
* *Timeout during provisioning* a new node.
* *Firewall, antivirus software or other network component kill the connection*
* *Lack of hardware resources*, e.g. memory, temp space, etc...

We also heard valuable user voice in the survey.

.What areas would you like to see better in Jenkins monitoring?
____
I have created a bunch of adhoc monitoring jobs to check on the agent's health
and send e-mail. Would be nice to have this consolidated.
____

____
Having archive of nodes with the access to their logs/events would have been
nice.
____

I hope that implementing these feature with OpenTelemetry, which is expected to
become the industry standard for observability, will bring great monitoring
experience to Jenkins community.

=== Proof of Concept

==== How to deliver the monitoring program to agents

===== 1. Sending monitoring program to the agent over remoting

image:/images/post-images/2021-07-31-remoting-monitoring-phase-1/sending-monitoring-program-via-remoting.png[Sending monitoring program via remoting]

In my first implementation, I prepared a Jenkins plugin and send the
monitoring program from Jenkins controller. However, this approach have
following disadvantages.

. We cannot collect telemetry data before the initial connection.
We are likely to encounter a problem while provisioning a new node,
so it's important to observe agents' telemetry data from the beginning.
. Some agent restarters (e.g. link:https://javadoc.jenkins.io/jenkins/slaves/restarter/UnixSlaveRestarter.html[UnixSlaveRestarter])
restart agent completely when reconnecting. It means that the agent lost
monitoring program every time the connection closed, and we cannot collect
telemetry data after the connection is lost before a new connection is
established.

So we decided to take the next approach.

===== 2. Install monitoring engine when provisioning a new agent

image:/images/post-images/2021-07-31-remoting-monitoring-phase-1/install-monitoring-engine-when-provisioning.png[Installing monitoring engine when provisioning]

In this approach, user will download the monitoring program called monitoring
engine, which is a JAR file, and place it in the agent node when provisioning.

==== How to instrument remoting to produce remoting trace

===== Add instrumentation extension point to remoting

Pull Request: https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting/pull/471

This approach makes the agent launch command more complicated,
and we have to overcome this problem.

==== Traces

We tried several approaches to instrument remoting module, but good approach is not established yet.

Here is a draft documentation of the spans to collect. link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gjRamLWz3NwenVifC5pYyBMmxsUjl9MjspZF0mRYeaI/edit#heading=h.6xn68iwvd7gz[Google Doc]

==== Logs

Coming soon!

=== Metric and span demo visualization

Our team created a demo example with Docker compose and visualized the metrics and spans.
