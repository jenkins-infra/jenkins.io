DevOps World | Jenkins World 2018 in San Francisco is only a month away.
It is shaping up to be a great event including the Contributor Summit,
the "Ask the Experts" desk at the Jenkins booth, several days of training and certifications,
and tons of informative presentation and demos.

To give you a taste of what you'll see this year at DevOps World | Jenkins World 2018,
we've lined up a series of guest blog posts by a number of this years speakers,
starting in the next week with posts from Tracy Miranda, Brent Laster, and Nicholas De Loof.
For now, let's take a look at last year's keynote from Kohsuke Kawaguchi.
