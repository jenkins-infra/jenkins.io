Your Jenkins CI orchestration is all about workflow processing for your Dev process, but now you want to push continuous delivery.
This of course means you need to have the pre-production and production teams on board with automation.
Seems like an easy task, but you will soon find that cultural transformation in organizations is hard.
Really hard.
Whether you work in a large, small or somewhere in between organization, teams continuously struggle with changing cultural mindset to one of automation, inclusion and efficient workflow and design.


So where do you start?
Choosing the right tools can streamline this process, but how can you get people on board?
And what are the risks if they choose not to follow your path to a fully automated process across the pipeline?

Communicating the full benefits of what you have achieved by automating your development processes is a good place to start.
But, by now most organizations understand the benefit of agile practices and its ability to deliver new innovation to end users at a rapid pace.
And therein lies the real issue.
Most organizations have not seen the promise of agile due mainly in part to downstream practices that continue to be rooted in waterfall methods.
While agile practices have brought testing into the same room as developers, this is not always the case for production control.
Not everyone has adopted the concept of a Site Reliability Engineer, someone who manages production, but works on the same Agile team as the developers.
Most production deployments are still managed by throwing updates over the proverbial wall and waiting for the production team to execute their own release process to the production environment.
And it may not be fast or agile.

How can we bring production teams into the new practice of continuous delivery and deployment?
The most critical component is understanding that production teams live by a different mantra than agile developers.
Agile developers believe that large, monolithic quarterly releases are high risk.
Managing 3 months’ worth of change in a single release can create a deployment headache.
Bug discovered in production in this cycle can sometimes take months to resolve, if we even know they’re there in the first place.
On the other side of the house, production control believes that a team that is doing daily releases must have real issues, and therefore are high risk.
If agile practices are going to truly achieve continuous deployment, where production gets new updates as soon as they are ready, we have some work and listening to do on the production release side of the house.

While we are shifting to a more DevOps approach, Production Teams have some basic requirements that Developers need to understand.

* Production Teams want to make sure that the new code being released is ‘ready.’
  By that they often refer to the underlying infrastructure stack.
  They need to know if the new code was built on the Production version of the infrastructure.
* Production Teams want to understand impact.
  Now this is where Agile teams can really help.
  Include as part of your Production Workflow clear reporting, showing what has changed between the last two deployments.
  Provide the production team a means to evaluate how impactful the change is and precisely what endpoints will be updated.
* Start involving the DBAs and include their DB updates in your release processing.
  Production teams see a software application as an entire stack – the application update, the DB update, environment variable changes and infrastructure requirements.
  Leaving the database updates out of your process will not sit well with the Production Teams.
* Show the Production Teams that you can easily rollback, rollforward or jump to any version to quickly get Production back ‘on-line.’
* Most importantly, practicing these ideas within your team will promote a community and culture of trust and transparency,
  laying the groundwork for your developers to release better code, delivery fewer bugs to production,
  and empower team members to better understand the value proposition of why we write software,
  and what exactly we’re delivering to our end users.

Remember, Production Control wants to keep the Production environment as healthy as possible.
Your job is to proof it is possible even when deployments are being pushed on a high frequency basis.
When  you do that, you will achieve the full promise of agile.
