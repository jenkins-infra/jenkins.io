title: "When using tags in Jenkins Pipeline"
tags:
- pipeline
- git

One common pattern for automated releases I have seen and used relies on Git
tags as the catalyst for a release process. The immutable nature of releases
and the immutable nature of tags can definitely go hand in hand, but up until
few months ago Jenkins Pipeline was not able to trigger effectively off of Git
tags.

In this post I want to briefly share how to use tags to drive behaviors in
Jenkins Pipeline. Consider the following contrived `Jenkinsfile`, which
contains the three basic stages of Build, Test, and Deploy:

[source, groovy]
----
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'make package'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'make check'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            when { tag "release-*" }
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying only because this commit is tagged...'
                sh 'make deploy'
            }
        }
    }
}
----

Of particular note is the
link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#when[`when`]
condition on the "Deploy" stage which is applying the `tag` criteria. This
means the stage would only execute when the Pipeline has been triggered from a
tag in Git matching the `release-*` Ant-style wildcard.

In practice, this means that all pull requests, and branch-based Pipeline Runs
result in the stage being skipped:

When I push a `release-1.0` tag, the Pipeline will then be triggerd and run the
"Deploy" stage:

image::/images/post-images/pipeline-tags/deployed.png["Deployed!", role=center]


Out of the box, Pipelines won't trigger off of the presence of tags, which
means that a Multibranch Pipeline must have a configuration update to know that
it must Discover Tags.

== Configuring

From the configuration screen of a Multibranch Pipeline (or GitHub Organization
Folder), Discovering tags can be enabled by adding the appropriate "Behavior"
to the Branch Source configuration:

image::/images/post-images/pipeline-tags/branch-source.png["Configuring the Multibranch Pipeline", role=center]

With these changes, the `Jenkinsfile` in the tagged versions of my source
repository can now drive distinct deployment behavior which is not otherwise
enabled in the Pipeline.
