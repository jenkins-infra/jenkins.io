link:https://anchore.io/[Anchore] provides docker image analysis for user defined acceptance policies to allow automated image validation and acceptance.

As developers we would like to know if a change we are proposing introduces a 
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures[Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE)].
As operators we would like to know what running applications are affected if a new CVE is discovered.  

Now in Jenkins X pipelines, if we find an 
link:https://anchore.com/engine/[Anchore engine] service running we will add the preview and release images to be analyzed.
This means we can look at any environment including previews (created from Pull Requests) 
to see if your application contains a CVE.

== Upgrade

Start by checking your current Jenkins X version:

[source, bash]
----
jx version
----

If your Jenkins X platform is older than 0.0.903, then first you will need to upgrade to at least 0.0.922:

[source, bash]
----
jx upgrade cli
jx upgrade platform
----

== Install addon

You can install the 
link:https://hub.kubeapps.com/charts/stable/anchore-engine[Anchore engine addon] 
when you are in your Jenkins X team `home` environment.

[source, bash]
----
jx env dev
jx create addon anchore
----

This will install the engine in a separate `anchore` namespace 
and create a service link in the current team `home` environment
so our pipeline builds can add docker images to Anchore for analysis.

== Create an application

You can now create a new quickstart:

[source, bash]
----
jx create quickstart
----

=== List any CVEs

Once the build has run you will be able to check for CVEs in any environment including previews created for pull requests.

[source, bash]
----
jx get cve --environment staging
----

== Demo

Here's a 4 minute video that demonstrates the steps above:

=== Upgrading existing pipelines

If you have an existing application pipeline and and want enable image analysis you can update your Jenkinsfile,
in the `preview` stage after the skaffold step add the line

[source, groovy]
----
sh "jx step validate --min-jx-version 1.2.36"
sh "jx step post build --image \$JENKINS_X_DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVICE_HOST:\$JENKINS_X_DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVICE_PORT/$ORG/$APP_NAME:$PREVIEW_VERSION"
----

In the `master` stage the add this line after the skaffold step

[source, groovy]
----
sh "jx step validate --min-jx-version 1.2.36"
sh "jx step post build --image \$JENKINS_X_DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVICE_HOST:\$JENKINS_X_DOCKER_REGISTRY_SERVICE_PORT/$ORG/$APP_NAME:\$(cat VERSION)"
