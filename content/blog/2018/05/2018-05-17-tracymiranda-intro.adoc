I’m Tracy Miranda, and I’m really excited to have joined CloudBees this month leading the open source program. CloudBees’ contributions to Jenkins include developing Pipeline and Blue Ocean, staffing the infrastructure team, advocacy and events work, as well as security efforts. My focus is on making sure there is a great relationship between the Jenkins community and CloudBees, which means strong communication, help get traction on things the community wants, and generally working to make Jenkins and the community thrive and stay awesome in an ever-changing tech landscape. 

Here’s a little background on me: I come from an electronics/EDA background but switched to software early in my career when I first got involved with open source software. I’ve been part of the Eclipse community for around 15 years, definitely from before git was even a thing. I love being involved with all levels: project committer, conference chair, steering committee for working groups and more recently board of directors.

On a personal note, I …

* Live in the UK with my husband and 2 young kids
* Grew up in Kenya
* Enjoy playing badminton, love good food & am always first at any buffets

I am looking forward to getting to know the Jenkins community well, and really getting a feel for your Jenkins stories, good and bad. Please feel free to let me know:

* What you love about the Jenkins community & how you are using Jenkins
* What you’re working on doing with Jenkins
* What you don’t like and want improved

You can find me on the mailing lists or via:

* Twitter https://twitter.com/tracymiranda[@tracymiranda]
* Email: tmiranda@cloudbees.com
* IRC: tracymiranda

Also I’ll be at the upcoming events:  link:https://www.cloudbees.com/devops-world[DevOps World - Jenkins World] in San Francisco, California and Nice, France so if you plan to attend do come and say hi. The Jenkins community is the real force behind Jenkins. And in turn Jenkins powers so much of the software out there. It is an honour to be joining this wonderful community.
