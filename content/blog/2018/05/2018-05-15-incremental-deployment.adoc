A couple of weeks ago, Tyler mentioned some
link:/blog/2018/04/27/essentials-versions-are-numbered/#developer-improvements[developer improvements in Essentials]
that had been recently introduced:
the ability for
link:https://ci.jenkins.io/[ci.jenkins.io]
builds to get deployed automatically to an “Incrementals” Maven repository,
as described in
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/305/README.adoc[JEP-305].
For a plugin maintainer, you just need to
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/incrementals-tools/blob/master/README.md#enabling-incrementals-the-easy-way[turn on this support]
and you are ready to both deploy individual Git commits from your repository
without the need to run heavyweight traditional Maven releases,
and to depend directly on similar commits of Jenkins core or other plugins.
This is a stepping stone toward continuous delivery, and ultimately deployment, of Jenkins itself.

Here I would like to peek behind the curtain a bit at how we did this,
since the solution turns out to be very interesting for people thinking about security in Jenkins.
I will gloss over the Maven arcana required to get the project version to look like `1.40-rc301.87ce0dd8909b`
(a real example from the
link:https://repo.jenkins-ci.org/incrementals/org/jenkins-ci/plugins/copyartifact/1.40-rc301.87ce0dd8909b/[Copy Artifact plugin])
rather than the usual `1.40-SNAPSHOT`, and why this format is even useful.
Suffice it to say that if you had enough permissions, you could run

[source,bash]
----
mvn -Dset.changelist -DskipTests clean deploy
----

from your laptop to publish your latest commit.
Indeed as
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/305/README.adoc#automated-deployment-to-the-incrementals-repository[mentioned in the JEP],
the most straightforward server setup would be to run more or less that command
from the `buildPlugin` function called from a typical `Jenkinsfile`,
with some predefined credentials adequate to upload to the Maven repository.

Unfortunately, that simple solution did not look very secure.
If you offer deployment credentials to a Jenkins job,
you need to trust anyone who might configure that job (here, its `Jenkinsfile`)
to use those credentials appropriately.
(The `withCredentials` step will mask the password from the log file, to prevent _accidental_ disclosures.
It in no way blocks _deliberate_ misuse or theft.)
If your Jenkins service runs inside a protected network and works with private repositories,
that is probably good enough.

For this project, we wanted to permit incremental deployments from any pull request.
Jenkins will refuse to run `Jenkinsfile` modifications from people
who would not normally be able to merge the pull request or push directly,
and those people would be more or less trustworthy Jenkins developers,
but that is of no help if a pull request changes `pom.xml`
or other source files used by the build itself.
If the server administrator exposes a secret to a job,
and it is bound to an environment variable while running some open-ended command like a Maven build,
there is no practical way to control what might happen.

The lesson here is that the unit of access control in Jenkins is the job.
You can control who can configure a job, or who can edit files it uses,
but you have no control over what the job _does_ or how it might use any credentials.
For JEP-305, therefore, we wanted a way to perform deployments from builds considered as black boxes.
This means a division of responsibility:
the build produces some artifacts, however it sees fit;
and another process picks up those artifacts and deploys them.

This worked was tracked in
link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-1571[INFRA-1571].
The idea was to create a “serverless function” in Azure
that would retrieve artifacts from Jenkins at the end of a build,
perform a set of validations to ensure that the artifacts follow an expected repository path pattern,
and finally deploy them to Artifactory using a trusted token.
I prototyped this in Java, Tyler
link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/community-functions/blob/master/incrementals-publisher/README.adoc[rewrote it in JavaScript],
and together we brought it into production.

The crucial bit here is what information (or misinformation!) the Jenkins build can send to the function.
All we actually need to know is the build URL, so the
link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/pipeline-library/blob/442485fc03101d4f52856ea48825a4d45acece7e/vars/infra.groovy#L227-L245[call site from Jenkins]
is quite simple.
When the function is called with this URL,
it starts off by performing input validation:
it knows what the Jenkins base URL is,
and what a build URL from inside an organization folder is supposed to look like:
`https://ci.jenkins.io/job/Plugins/job/git-plugin/job/PR-582/17/`, for example.

The next step is to call back to Jenkins and ask it for some metadata about that build.
While we do not trust the _build_, we trust the server that ran it to be properly configured.
An obstacle here was that the `ci.jenkins.io` server had been configured to disable the Jenkins REST API;
with Tyler’s guidance I was able to amend this policy to permit API requests from registered users
(or, in the case of the Incrementals publisher, a bot).

If you want to try this at home, get an
link:https://ci.jenkins.io/me/configure[API token],
pick a build of an “incrementalified” plugin or Jenkins core,
and run something like

[source,bash]
----
curl -igu <login>:<token> 'https://ci.jenkins.io/job/Plugins/job/git-plugin/job/PR-582/17/api/json?pretty&tree=actions[revision[hash,pullHash]]'
----

You will see a `hash` or `pullHash` corresponding to the _main commit_ of that build.
(This information was added to the Jenkins REST API to support this use case in
link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-50777[JENKINS-50777].)
The main commit is selected when the build starts
and always corresponds to the version of `Jenkinsfile` in the repository for which the job is named.
While a build might `checkout` any number of repositories,
`checkout scm` always picks “this” repository in “this” version.
Therefore the deployment function knows for sure which commit the sources came from,
and will refuse to deploy artifacts named for some other commit.

Next it looks up information about the Git repository at the folder level (again from JENKINS-50777):

[source,bash]
----
curl -igu <login>:<token> 'https://ci.jenkins.io/job/Plugins/job/git-plugin/api/json?pretty&tree=sources[source[repoOwner,repository]]'
----

The Git repository now needs to be correlated to a list of Maven artifact paths that this component is expected to produce.
The
link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/repository-permissions-updater[repository-permissions-updater]
(RPU) tool already had a list of artifact paths used to perform permission checks on regular release deployments to Artifactory; in
link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/INFRA-1598[INFRA-1598]
I extended it to also record the GitHub repository name, as can be seen
link:https://ci.jenkins.io/job/Infra/job/repository-permissions-updater/job/master/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/json/github.index.json[here].
Now the function knows that the CI build in this example may legitimately create artifacts in the `org/jenkins-ci/plugins/git/` namespace
including `38c569094828` in their versions.
The build is expected to have produced artifacts in the same structure as `mvn install` sends to the local repository,
so the function downloads everything associated with that commit hash:

[source,bash]
----
curl -sg 'https://ci.jenkins.io/job/Plugins/job/git-plugin/job/PR-582/17/artifact/**/*-rc*.38c569094828/*-rc*.38c569094828*/*zip*/archive.zip' | jar t
----

When all the artifacts are indeed inside the expected path(s),
and at least one POM file is included (here `org/jenkins-ci/plugins/git/3.9.0-rc1671.38c569094828/git-3.9.0-rc1671.38c569094828.pom`),
then the ZIP file looks good—ready to send to Artifactory.

One last check is whether the commit has already been deployed (perhaps this is a rebuild).
If it has not, the function uses the Artifactory REST API to atomically upload the ZIP file
and uses the GitHub Status API to associate a message with the commit
so that you can see right in your pull request that it got deployed:

image:/images/post-images/2018-05-15/incrementals-status.png[width="1104",float="left"]

One more bit of caution was required.
Just because we successfully published some bits from some PR does not mean they should be _used_!
We also needed a tool which lets you select the newest published version of some artifact
_within a particular branch_, usually `master`.
This was tracked in
link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-50953[JENKINS-50953]
and is available to start with as a Maven command operating on a `pom.xml`:

[source,bash]
----
mvn incrementals:update
----

This will check Artifactory for updates to relevant components.
When each one is found, it will use the GitHub API to check whether the commit has been merged to the selected branch.
Only matches are offered for update.

Putting all this together, we have a system for continuously delivering components
from any of the hundreds of Jenkins Git repositories
triggered by the simple act of filing a pull request.
Securing that system was a lot of work
but highlights how boundaries of trust interact with CI/CD.
