We just released security updates to Jenkins, versions 2.121 and 2.107.3, that fix multiple security vulnerabilities.

Additionally, we announce previously published security issues and corresponding fixes in these plugins:

* plugin:blackduck-hub[Black Duck Hub]
* plugin:groovy-postbuild[Groovy Postbuild]
* plugin:gitlab-hook[Gitlab Hook] (fix unreleased)

For an overview of what was fixed, see the link:/security/advisory/2018-05-09[security advisory].
For an overview on the possible impact of these changes on upgrading Jenkins LTS, see our link:/doc/upgrade-guide/2.107/#upgrading-to-jenkins-lts-2-107-3[LTS upgrade guide].
