=== Local events

Hacktoberfest is an online event,
but there are many events being organized by open-source communities.
You can join one of link:https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/#events[these events].

We also encourage link:/projects/jam/[Jenkins Area Meetup] organizers to
run Jenkins-specific events in October (workshops, hackergartens).
If you are not a meetup organizer but want to host a meetup,
you can reach out to the organizers via meetup.com resources
(you can find a JAM link:https://www.meetup.com/pro/jenkins[here]).

=== FAQ

You can find Hacktoberfest FAQ link:https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/faq[here].
Below you can find answer to some Jenkins-specific questions.

==== Q: I am new to Jenkins, how do I start?

If you are new to Jenkins,
you could start by fixing some small and well described issues.
There are lists of such newbie-friendly issues, see the links in the table above.
You can also submit your own issue and propose a fix.

==== Q: I want to work on my own plugin, is it fine?

Yes, it is fine!
Any contributions count, your role in a repository does not matter.
Just make sure you create pull requests instead of direct pushes
(hint: it's a best practice if you have a CI configured for your repository).

==== Q: How to find documentation?

Jenkins project contains lots of materials about contributing to the project.
Here are some links which may help:

* link:/participate/[Participate] - landing page for newcomer contributors
* link:/blog/2017/08/07/intro-to-plugin-development/[Plugin Development Tutorials]
* link:/doc/developer/[Developer Documentation]
* link:https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/jenkins[Gitter channel] for Q&A

Projects in the table above also have their own documentation to help newcomers.

==== Q: How do I get reviews?

All projects in the list above are monitored by their maintainers,
and you will likely get a review within few days.
Reviews in other repositories and plugins may take longer.
In the case of delays, ping us in the link:https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/hacktoberfest-help[hacktoberfest-help] channel in Gitter.
Unmerged pull-requests also count in Hacktoberfest,
so merge delays won't block you from getting prizes.

==== Q: I am stuck. How do I get help?

* For non-technical questions (process and general direction) use our link:https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/hacktoberfest-help[hacktoberfest-help]
channel in Gitter.
* For technical questions please use the link:/chat[IRC chat],
link:/mailing-lists/[Developer mailing lists],
or the main link:https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/jenkins[jenkinsci/jenkins] channel.
Many subprojects also have their own chats.

==== Q: Does Jenkins project send special swag?

All participants will get swag from Hacktoberfest organizers if they create at least5 pull requests.
Jenkins project may also distribute some swag to top contributors,
depending on the budget and contributions.
