TIP: _Jenkins Essentials_ has been renamed to _Jenkins **Evergreen**_ since this was written.

In his presentation at the 2017 link:https://jenkinsworld.com[Jenkins World] Contributor Summit,
link:https://github.com/kohsuke[Kohsuke]
challenged us to continue the work started with Jenkins 2 of making Jenkins
easier to install and easier to use. "A user should be successful with Jenkins
in under five minutes and five clicks." At that same Contributor Summit, a few
of us discussed the idea of a distribution which had "batteries
included", which
link:https://github.com/abayer[Andrew]
proudly named "Jenkins Essentials." At the time I was certainly not as excited
about the project as I am now, I thought to myself "we built a Setup Wizard in
Jenkins 2, nobody needs a Setup Wizard++."

As Kohsuke and I continued to discuss the idea, more and more ideas came up.
Towards the end of 2017 the picture became much clearer: **Jenkins Essentials
would be a comprehensive, low-maintenance distribution** to help new and
existing users be successful with Jenkins, without needing to be Jenkins
_experts_. This will of course not replace the existing distribution of Jenkins core and
its plugins, which allow many of us large amounts of flexibility, but rather it
will make Jenkins easier for users who don't want to "build it themselves."

The more I thought about it, the more excited about the idea I became: Jenkins
Essentials could open the door to new improvements and features in Jenkins
which had been left in the "idea and design" phase going back almost _two
years_! Really, I checked, some of the concepts adopted into the design of
Jenkins Essentials were first conceived of in early 2016!

Kohsuke briefly discussed the project in
link:/blog/2018/03/20/evolving-mission-of-jenkins/[his previous blog post]
but in post I wanted to expand on <<what, what>> Jenkins Essentials is, and our
<<progress, progress>> has been in its development.

[[what]]
== What's in Jenkins Essentials

A few months ago I prepared
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/300/jenkins-essentials-and-evergreen-fosdem-2018.pdf[this presentation]
for the
link:https://fosdem.org/2018/[FOSDEM 2018]
Jenkins Contributor Summit, which outlines the following "pillars" or Jenkins
Essentials, which are also described in
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/300[JEP-300]:

* <<auto-update>>
* <<sane-defaults>>
* <<connected>>
* <<obvious-path>>


[[auto-update]]
=== Automatically Updated Distribution

In order to provide an easier-to-use and easier-to-manage Jenkins environment,
Jenkins Essentials will be distributed as an automatically self-updating
distribution, containing Jenkins core and a version-locked set of plugins
considered "essential." Rather than attempting to mirror the existing Weekly
and LTS release lines for core, plus some plugin version matrix, Jenkins
Essentials will update in a manner similar to Google Chrome.

This automatically updating distribution will mean that Jenkins Essentials will
require significantly less overhead to manage, receiving improvements and bug
fixes without any user involvement. From the user perspective, their Jenkins
will appear to automatically improve over time.

[NOTE]
====
There is really interesting work being pioneered by
link:https://github.com/batmat[Baptiste Mathus]
with
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/302[JEP-302]
to ensure that these automatic upgrades can be performed safely.

[[sane-defaults]]
=== Automatic Sane Defaults

Providing a core along with "essential" plugins is a good first step to helping
Jenkins users successfully automate their CI/CD workloads, but requires
additional "smoothing" over some of the numerous options and configurations
plugins. Jenkins Essentials will perform some amount of "automatic
environment-based self-configuration."

For example, clicking a "Launch Stack" button from the link:/download[Download]
page would launch an AWS-flavored Jenkins Essentials which, out of the box
attempts to set up AWS-specific configuration with S3 and EC2 services.

[[connected]]
=== Connected

In order to provide a more seamless experience for end-users, and ensure that
Jenkins project developers receive useful error and usage telemetry to drive
further improvements in Jenkins, Jenkins Essentials must necessarily be viewed
as a "**Connected**" application. This means some yet-to-be-specified number of
server-side applications to coordinate updates, receive and process telemetry,
broker 3rd-party service authentications, relay webhooks, etc.

[[obvious-path]]
=== Obvious Path to User Success

The final pillar in Jenkins Essentials, is to ensure that Jenkins provides an
obvious path for a user to configure and use it successfully. This largely
entails in-application documentation, examples, and disabling legacy
functionality within the application. All with the end goal of preventing users
from inadvertently choosing legacy, or poorly supported, options when
configuring their CI/CD workloads.

[[progress]]
== Progress thus far

Suffice it to say, Jenkins Essentials is a hugely ambitious project! We have
been making steady progress however, as you can see in the
link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/evergreen[jenkins-infra/evergreen]
repository on GitHub. We have been adamantly following the
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep[Jenkins Enhancement Proposal]
process, and have been making sure our designs and implementations are clear as
we build them. Thus far we've written designs and implemented:

* JEP-300: link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/300[Jenkins Essentials]
* JEP-301: link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/301[Evergreen packaging for Jenkins Essentials]
* JEP-302: link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/302[Evergreen snapshotting data safety system]
* JEP-303: link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/303[Evergreen Client Registration and Authentication]
* JEP-304: link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/304[Essentials Client Error Telemetry Logging]


Unfortunately we don't yet have the first parts of the <<auto-update>> working,
which means you cannot download Jenkins Essentials _today_ and get started with
it. We're still building the Jenkins-side and server-side components necessary
to make the full feedback loop operate, without which we would not be able to
safely deliver new upgrades to Jenkins Essentials installations.

Jenkins Essentials is just one major initiative going on in the Jenkins project
this year, so I hope you're as excited as I am for the future of Jenkins!
