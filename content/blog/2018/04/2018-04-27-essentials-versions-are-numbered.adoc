TIP: _Jenkins Essentials_ has been renamed to _Jenkins **Evergreen**_ since this was written.

A couple weeks ago, I
link:/blog/2018/04/06/jenkins-essentials/[wrote about the Jenkins Essentials]
effort, on which we've been making steady progress. Personally, the most
exciting challenge of this project is defining the machinery to drive
link:/blog/2018/04/06/jenkins-essentials/#auto-update[automatic updates]
of Jenkins Essentials, which viewed from a high level, are _classic_ continuous
delivery challenges.

In this post, I wanted to dive into a bit of the gritty details of how we're
going to be delivering Jenkins Essentials with automatic updates, which has
some really interesting requirements for the development of Jenkins itself.

The traditional Jenkins core and plugin development workflow involves a
developer working on changes for some amount of time, then when they're ready,
they "create a release" which typically involves publishing artifacts to our
Artifactory, and then on a timer (typically every 15 minutes) the Update Center will
re-generate a file called `update-center.json`. Once the new Update Center has
been generated, it is published and consumed by Jenkins installations within
24 hours. Of course, only after Jenkins administrators recognize that there is
an update available, can they install it. All in all, it can take quite a long
time from when a developer publishes a release, to when it is successfully used
by an end-user.


With our desire to make Jenkins Essentials updates seamless and automatic, the
status quo clearly was not going to work. Our shift in thinking has required a
couple simultaneous efforts to make this more continuously delivered approach
viable.


== Developer Improvements

Starting from the developer's workflow,
link:https://github.com/jglick[Jesse Glick]
has been working on publishing "incremental builds" of artifacts into a
link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/iep/tree/master/iep-009[special Maven repository]
in Artifactory. Much of his work is described in the very thorough
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/305[Jenkins Enhancement Proposal 305].
This support, which is _now live_ on
link:https://ci.jenkins.io/blue/[ci.jenkins.io]
allows plugin developers to publish versioned changes from _pull requests_ and
_branches_ to the `incrementals` repository. Not only does this make it much
easier for Jenkins Essentials to deliver changes closer to the `HEAD` of
`master` branches, it also unlocks lots of flexibility for Jenkins developers
who coordinate changes across matrices of plugins and core, as occasionally is
necessary for Jenkins Pipeline, Credentials, Blue Ocean, and a number of other
foundational components of a modern Jenkins install.

In a follow-up blog post, Jesse is going to go into much more detail on some of
the access control and tooling changes he had to solve to make this
incrementals machinery work.


Of course, incremental builds are only a piece of the puzzle, with those
artifacts, Jenkins Essentials has to be able to do something useful with them!


== Update Improvements

The number one requirement, from my perspective, for the automatically updated
distribution is that it is **safe**. "Safe" means that a user doesn't need to
be involved in the update process, and if something goes wrong, the
instance recovers without the user needing to do anything to remediate a
"bad code deploy."

In my previous post on the subject, I mentioned Baptiste's work on
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/302[Jenkins Enhancement
Proposal 302] which describes the "data safety" system for safely applying
updates, and in case of failure, rolling back.

The next obvious question is "what's failure?" which Baptiste spent some time
exploring and implementing in two more designs:

. link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/304[JEP-304: Essentials Client Error Telemetry Logging]
. link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/306[JEP-306: Essentials Instance Client Health Checking]


On the server side, of which there is substantial work for Jenkins Essentials,
these concepts integrate with the concept of an
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/307[Update Lifecycle]
between the server and client. In essence, the server side must be able to
deliver the right updates to the right clients, and avoid delivering tainted
updates (those with known problems) to clients. While this part of the work is
still on-going, tremendous progress has been made over the past couple weeks
in ensuring that updates can be safely, securely, and automatically delivered.

With the ability to identify "bad code deploys", and having a mechanism for
safely rolling back, not only does Jenkins Essentials allow seamless
updates, but it enables Jenkins developers to deliver features and bugfixes
_much_ more quickly than our current distribution model allows.

While Jenkins Essentials does not have a package ready for broad consumption
yet, we're rapidly closing in on the completion of our first milestone which
ties all of these automatic update components together and builds the
foundation for continuous delivery of all subsequent improvements.
