Its been 24 days since we 
link:https://jenkins.io/blog/2018/03/19/introducing-jenkins-x/[announced Jenkins X],
a CI/CD solution for modern cloud applications on Kubernetes. 
I'm truly blown away by the response and feedback from the community - thank you!

We've also had lots of folks report they've successfully used link:https://jenkins-x.io/[Jenkins X]
on a number of clouds including GKE, AWS and AKS along with on premise clusters which is great to hear!

Here's a brief overview of the changes in the last 24 days from the 
link:https://jenkins-x.io/contribute/roadmap/[Roadmap]:

* we now fully support GitHub and GitHub enterprise. BitBucket cloud and gitea is almost there too. 
  Hopefully BitBucketServer and Gitlab are not too far away either. For more detail see 
  link:https://jenkins-x.io/developing/git/[supporting different git servers]
* For issue tracking we support GitHub, GitHub Enterprise and JIRA. For more detail see 
  link:https://jenkins-x.io/developing/issues/[supporting issue trackers]
* Gradle support is now available from link:https://jenkins-x.io/developing/create-spring/[jx create spring]
  or by importing gradle apps
* Go, Node and Rust build packs are now available with more link:https://jenkins-x.io/contribute/roadmap/[planned]
* New _addons_ for link:https://anchore.com/[anchore] and link:https://kubeless.io/[kubeless]

Also we've made it a little bit easier to keep your `jx` binary up to date _continuously_. Just type one of the following:

* link:https://jenkins-x.io/commands/jx_version/[`jx version`] will prompt you if there is a new version available
  and if prompted, it will upgrade itself
* link:https://jenkins-x.io/commands/jx_upgrade_cli/[`jx upgrade cli`] will upgrade the `jx` binary if its available or
  link:https://jenkins-x.io/commands/jx_upgrade_platform/[`jx upgrade platform`] for the platform
