Last week we released the latest version of Declarative Pipelines, version
1.2.8. With that out, we thought now would be a good time to introduce you to
the new features and options that have been added to Declarative since the
beginning of 2018. These are all available _now_ in the Update Center, with
version 1.2.8.

== Declarative Directive Generator

This is something we're really happy about - if you go to the "Pipeline Syntax"
link from your Pipeline's page in Jenkins, you'll see a couple new links on the
left, including "Declarative Directive Generator". The Directive Generator is
much like the Snippet Generator that's been in Pipeline for a couple years now,
but where the Snippet Generator is just for filling out a form for a step and
generating the Pipeline code that configuration maps to, the Directive
Generator is built to help you write your Declarative Pipeline directives, like
`agent`, `options`, `stage`, and more!

This is the first release to include the Directive Generator, and it's
definitely going to see more polish going forward, but we think it should be
quite helpful for you already. We'll be putting up another blog post looking at
the Directive Generator in more detail in the near future.

== New `when` conditions

We've added a number of new `when` conditions, providing you more control over
whether your stages get executed.

* `equals` - Compares two values - strings, variables, numbers, booleans - and
  returns true if they're equal. I'm honestly not sure how we missed adding
  this earlier! You can do "not equals" comparisons using the `not { equals ...
  }` combination too.
* `changeRequest` - In its simplest form, this will return true if this
  Pipeline is building a change request, such as a GitHub pull request. You can
  also do more detailed checks against the change request, allowing you to ask
  "is this a change request against the master branch?" and much more.
* `buildingTag` - A simple condition that just checks if the Pipeline is
  running against a tag in SCM, rather than a branch or a specific commit
  reference.
* `tag` - A more detailed equivalent of `buildingTag`, allowing you to check
  against the tag name itself.

In addition, we've added a new option to `when`: `beforeAgent`. This allows you
to specify that the `when` conditions should be evaluated before entering the
`agent` for the `stage`, rather than the normal behavior of evaluating `when`
conditions after entering the `agent`. When `beforeAgent true` is specified,
you will not have access to the `agent`'s workspace, but you can avoid
unnecessary SCM checkouts and waiting for a valid `agent` to be available. This
can speed up your Pipeline's execution in some cases.

== New `post` conditions

The `changed` condition has always been a bit confusing, and to be
honest, it wasn't our best work. `changed` will fire any time the current run's
status is different than the previous run's status - whether the current run is
healthier than the previous one, or the other way around. That's...not actually
very useful. So now we've added two new `post` conditions that should provide
you with a lot more value than `changed` has.

* `fixed` - This will check to see if the current run is successful, and if the
  previous run was either failed or unstable.
* `regression` - This will check to see if the current run's status is worse
  than the previous run's status. So if the previous run was successful, and
  the current run is unstable, this will fire and its block of steps will
  execute. It will also run if the previous run was unstable, and the current
  run is a failure, etc.

== New `options`

The `options` directive in Declarative can contain a number of different kinds
of configuration: traditional Jenkins job properties, like `buildDiscarder`,
wrapper steps to execute the entire Pipeline within, like `timeout`, and
Declarative-specific options that can switch from some default behaviors of
Declarative execution. We've added two new Declarative-specific options in the
last few releases.

* `checkoutToSubdirectory` - Allows you to override the location that the
  automatic SCM checkout will use. Using `checkoutToSubdirectory("foo")`, your
  Pipeline will checkout your repository to `"$WORKSPACE/foo"`, rather than the
  default of `"$WORKSPACE"`.
* `newContainerPerStage` - If you're using a top-level `docker` or `dockerfile`
  `agent`, and want to ensure that each of your stages run in a fresh container
  of the same image, you can use this option. Any `stage` without its own
  `agent` specified will run in a new container using the image you've
  specified or built, on the same computer and with access to the same
  workspace.

== Stage options

Sometimes, you may only want to disable automatic checkout of your repository,
using the `skipDefaultCheckout(true)` option, for one specific stage in your
Pipeline. Or perhaps you want to have a `timeout` that covers an entire
`stage`, including time spent waiting for a valid `agent`, `post` condition
execution, or the new `input` directive for stages (see further down for more
details on that!). To make those things possible, we've added a new `options`
direction to `stage`. You can use a subset of the top-level `options` content
in a `stage`'s `options` - wrapper steps, and Declarative-specific options that
are marked as legal in a `stage`.

== Input

You've always been able to run the `input` step inside a `stage`'s `steps`
block, but we've found that approach can lose out on some of the value that the
`input` step provides.

To help with that, we've added a new `input` directive
to `stage`, with the same parameters as the `input` step. When you use the
`stage` `input` directive rather than using the step directly, any parameters
you've specified for the `input` will be made available in the +stage+'s
environment, meaning you can reference parameters from the `input` in `when`
conditions, or in `environment` variables.

    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Example') {
            input {
                message "Should we continue?"
                ok "Yes, we should."
                submitter "alice,bob"
                parameters {
                    string(name: 'PERSON', defaultValue: 'Mr Jenkins', description: 'Who should I say hello to?')
                }
            }
            steps {
                echo "Hello, ${PERSON}, nice to meet you."
            }
        }
    }
}
// Script //

Also, the `input` directive is evaluated before you enter any `agent` specified
on this `stage`, so if you are using a top-level `agent none` and each `stage`
has its own `agent` specified, you can avoid consuming an executor while
waiting for the `input` to be submitted.

Lastly, you can use `timeout` in the `stage` `options`, as
mentioned above, to time-out the `input` if too much time has passed without a
response.

I hope you find these new features and options for Declarative Pipelines
helpful, and I look forward to the rest of 2018 as we continue to invest and
improve in link:/doc/book/pipeline[Jenkins Pipeline]!
