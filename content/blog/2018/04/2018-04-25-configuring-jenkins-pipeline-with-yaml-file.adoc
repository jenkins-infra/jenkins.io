A few years ago our CTO wrote about building a
link:https://medium.com/wolox-driving-innovation/ruby-on-rails-continuous-integration-with-jenkins-and-docker-compose-8dfd24c3df57[Continuous Integration server for Ruby On Rails using Jenkins and docker]. 
The solution has been our CI pipeline for the past years until we recently decided to
make an upgrade. Why?

* Jenkins version was way out of date and it was getting difficult to
upgrade
* link:https://www.wolox.co[Wolox] has grown significantly over the past years
and we’ve been experiencing scaling issues
* Very few people knew how to fix any issues with the server
* Configuring jobs was not an easy task and that made our project
kickoff process slower
* Making changes to the commands that each job runs was not easy and not
many people had permissions to do so. Wolox has a wide range of
projects, with a wide variety of languages which made this problem even
bigger.

Taking into account these problems, we started digging into the newest
version of Jenkins to see how we could improve our CI. We needed to
build a new CI that could, at least, address the following:

* Projects must be built using Docker. Our projects depend on one or
multiple docker images to run (app, database, redis, etc)
* Easy to configure and replicate if necessary
* Easy to add a new project
* Easy to change the building steps. Everyone working on the project
should be able to change if they want to run _npm install_ or _yarn
install_.

== Installing Jenkins and Docker

Installing Jenkins is straightforward. You can visit
link:/download/[Jenkins Installation page] and choose the
option that best suits your needs.

Here are the steps we followed to install Jenkins in AWS:

[source, bash]
----
sudo rpm — import https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.repo
sudo yum install java-1.8.0 -y
sudo yum remove java-1.7.0-openjdk -y
sudo yum install jenkins -y
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install -y docker
----

== Automatically adding projects from Github

Adding projects automatically from Github can be achieved using the
link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/github-branch-source[GitHub Branch Source Plugin].
It allows Jenkins to scan a GitHub organization
for projects that match certain rules and add them to Jenkins
automatically. The only constraint that all branches must meet in order
to be added is that they contain a Jenkinsfile that explains how to
build the project.

== Easy to change configuration

=== Not so easy to change configuration

One of the biggest pains we had with our previous Jenkins was the
difficulty of changing the steps necessary to build the project. If you
looked at a project’s build steps, you would find something like this:

[source, bash]
----
#!/bin/bash +x
set -e

# Remove unnecessary files
echo -e "\033[34mRemoving unnecessary files...\033[0m"
rm -f log/*.log &> /dev/null || true &> /dev/null
rm -rf public/uploads/* &> /dev/null || true &> /dev/null

# Build Project
echo -e "\033[34mBuilding Project...\033[0m"
docker-compose --project-name=${JOB_NAME} build

# Prepare test database
COMMAND="bundle exec rake db:drop db:create db:migrate"
echo -e "\033[34mRunning: $COMMAND\033[0m"
docker-compose --project-name=${JOB_NAME} run  \
	-e RAILS_ENV=test web $COMMAND

# Run tests
COMMAND="bundle exec rspec spec"
echo -e "\033[34mRunning: $COMMAND\033[0m"
unbuffer docker-compose --project-name=${JOB_NAME} run web $COMMAND

# Run rubocop lint
COMMAND="bundle exec rubocop app spec -R --format simple"
echo -e "\033[34mRunning: $COMMAND\033[0m"
unbuffer docker-compose --project-name=${JOB_NAME} run -e RUBYOPT="-Ku" web $COMMAND
----

And some post build steps that cleaned up the docker:

[source, bash]
----
#!/bin/bash +x
docker-compose --project-name=${JOB_NAME} stop &> /dev/null || true &> /dev/null
docker-compose --project-name=${JOB_NAME} rm --force &> /dev/null || true &> /dev/null
docker stop `docker ps -a -q -f status=exited` &> /dev/null || true &> /dev/null
docker rm -v `docker ps -a -q -f status=exited` &> /dev/null || true &> /dev/null
docker rmi `docker images --filter 'dangling=true' -q --no-trunc` &> /dev/null || true &> /dev/null
----

Although these commands are not complex, changing any of them required
someone with permissions to modify the job and an understanding ofwhat
needed to be done.

=== Jenkinsfile to the rescue... or not

With the current Jenkins version, we can take advantage of 
link:/doc/book/pipeline/[Jenkins Pipeline] and model our build
flow in a file. This file is checked into the repository and, therefore,
anyone with access to it can change the build steps. Yay!

Jenkins Pipeline even has support for:

* link:/doc/book/pipeline/docker/[Docker] and
link:/doc/book/pipeline/docker/#advanced-usage-with-scripted-pipeline[multiple
images] can be used for a build!
* Setting environment variables with _withEnv_ and many other built -in
functions that can be found
link:/doc/pipeline/steps/workflow-basic-steps/[here].

This makes a perfect case for link:https://www.wolox.co[Wolox]. We can have
our build configuration in a file that’s checked into the repository and
can be changed by anyone with write access to it. However, a Jenkinsfile
for a simple rails project would look something like this:

[source, groovy]
----
# sample Jenkinsfile. Might not compile
node {
    checkout scm
    withEnv(['MYTOOL_HOME=/usr/local/mytool']) {
        docker.image("postgres:9.2").withRun() { db ->
            withEnv(['DB_USERNAME=postgres', 'DB_PASSWORD=', "DB_HOST=db", "DB_PORT=5432"]) {
                docker.image("redis:X").withRun() { redis ->
                    withEnv(["REDIS_URL=redis://redis"]) {
                        docker.build(imageName, "--file .woloxci/Dockerfile .").inside("--link ${db.id}:postgres --link ${redis.id}:redis") {
                            sh "rake db:create"
                            sh "rake db:migrate"
                            sh "bundle exec rspec spec"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
----

This file is not only difficult to read, but also difficult to change.
It’s quite easy to break things if you’re not familiar with Groovy and
even easier if you know nothing about how Jenkins’ pipeline works.
Changing or adding a new Docker image isn’t straightforward and might
lead to confusion.

=== Configuring Jenkins Pipeline via YAML

Personally, I’ve always envied simple configuration files for CIs and
this time it was our chance to build CI that could be configured using a
YAML file. After some analysis we concluded that a YAML like this one
would suffice:

[source, yaml]
----
config:
  dockerfile: .woloxci/Dockerfile
  project_name: some-project-name

services:
  - postgresql
  - redis

steps:
  analysis:
    - bundle exec rubocop -R app spec --format simple
    - bundle exec rubycritic --path ./analysis --minimum-score 80 --no-browser
  setup_db:
    - bundle exec rails db:create
    - bundle exec rails db:schema:load
  test:
    - bundle exec rspec
  security:
    - bundle exec brakeman --exit-on-error
  audit:
    - bundle audit check --update


environment:
  RAILS_ENV: test
  GIT_COMMITTER_NAME: a
  GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL: b
  LANG: C.UTF-8
----

It outlines some basic configuration for the project, environment
variables that need to be present during the run, dependentservices, and
our build steps.

== Jenkinsfile + Shared Libraries = WoloxCI


After investigating for a while about Jenkins and the pipeline, we found
that we could extend it with
link:/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/[shared libraries].
Shared libraries are written in groovy and can be imported
into the pipeline and executed when necessary.

If you look carefully at this Jenkinsfile, 
we see that the code is a chain of methods calls that receive a
closure, where we execute another method passing a new closure to it.

[source, groovy]
----
# sample Jenkinsfile. Might not compile
node {
    checkout scm
    withEnv(['MYTOOL_HOME=/usr/local/mytool']) {
        docker.image("postgres:9.2").withRun() { db ->
            withEnv(['DB_USERNAME=postgres', 'DB_PASSWORD=', "DB_HOST=db", "DB_PORT=5432"]) {
                docker.image("redis:X").withRun() { redis ->
                    withEnv(["REDIS_URL=redis://redis"]) {
                        docker.build(imageName, "--file .woloxci/Dockerfile .").inside("--link ${db.id}:postgres --link ${redis.id}:redis") {
                            sh "rake db:create"
                            sh "rake db:migrate"
                            sh "bundle exec rspec spec"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
----


Groovy is flexible enough to allow this same declarative code to be
created at runtime, making our dream of using a YAML to configure our
job come true!

== Introducing Wolox-CI

That’s how link:https://github.com/Wolox/wolox-ci[wolox-ci] was born- our
shared library for Jenkins!

With link:https://github.com/Wolox/wolox-ci[wolox-ci], our Jenkinsfile is now
reduced to:

[source, groovy]
----
@Library('wolox-ci') _

node {

  checkout scm

  woloxCi('.woloxci/config.yml');
}
----

Now it simply checks out the code and then calls wolox-ci. The library
reads yaml file like this one

[source, yaml]
----
config:
  dockerfile: .woloxci/Dockerfile
  project_name: some-project-name

services:
  - postgresql
  - redis

steps:
  analysis:
    - bundle exec rubocop -R app spec --format simple
    - bundle exec rubycritic --path ./analysis --minimum-score 80 --no-browser
  setup_db:
    - bundle exec rails db:create
    - bundle exec rails db:schema:load
  test:
    - bundle exec rspec
  security:
    - bundle exec brakeman --exit-on-error
  audit:
    - bundle audit check --update


environment:
  RAILS_ENV: test
  GIT_COMMITTER_NAME: a
  GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL: b
  LANG: C.UTF-8
----

and builds the Jenkinsfile to get your job running on the fly.

The nice part about having a shared library is that we can extend and
fix our library in a centralized way. Once we add new code, the library
is automatically updated in Jenkins which will notify all of our jobs
with the update.

Since we have projects in different languages we use Docker to build the
testing environment. WoloxCI assumes there is a Dockerfile to build and
will run all the specified commands inside the container.

=== Woloxci config.yml

==== Config

The first part of the config.yml file specifies some basic
configuration: project’s name and Dockerfile location. The Dockerfile is
used to build the image where the commands will be run.

==== Services

This section describes which services will be exposed to the container.
Out of the box, WoloxCI has support for _postgresql_, _mssql_ and
_redis_. You can also specify the docker image version you want! It is
not hard to add a new service. You just need to add the corresponding
file at

https://github.com/Wolox/wolox-ci/tree/development/vars

and modify how the services are parsed

https://github.com/Wolox/wolox-ci/blob/development/src/com/wolox/parser/ConfigParser.groovy#L76

==== Steps

The listed commands in this section will run inside the Docker
container. As a result, you’ll see each of the steps on the Jenkins UI.

image:https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/0*SlHf1JHAAvEvZQ74.[image]

==== Environment

If you need some environment variables during your build, you can
specify them here. Whatever variable you set will be available inside
the Docker container when your commands listed in the *steps* section
described above.

== Wrapping up

WoloxCI is still being tested with a not-so-small sample of our
projects. The possibility of changing the build steps through a YAML
file makes it accessible for everyone and that is a great improvement in
our CI workflow.

Docker gives us the possibility of easily changing the programming
language without making any changes to our Jenkins installation and
Jenkins’ Github Organization feature automatically adds new projects
when a new repository with a Jenkinsfile is detected.

All of these improvements have reduced the time we spend maintaining
Jenkins significantly and give us the possibility of easily scaling
without any extra configuration.

This library is working in our CI but it still can be improved.
