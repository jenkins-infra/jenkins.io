Hello, I am Jenn, the new Product Manager for Blue Ocean and Jenkins
Pipeline at CloudBees. I am based out of the Seattle area and am excited to be
working on Jenkins. :D We released version 1.5.0 of the Blue Ocean plugin late last week. If you're
using Blue Ocean, you'll want to grab this update since it includes many
improvements and bug fixes!


== New Features

Blue Ocean now includes a user interface update to show the downstream jobs
launched with the 'build' step
(link: https://issue-redirect.jenkins.io/issue/38339[JENKINS-38339])

With Blue Ocean 1.5.0, users can now **Reorder Steps in the Blue Ocean Pipeline
Editor** simply by dragging and dropping steps to reorder them in the list of
steps.
(link:https://issue-redirect.jenkins.io/issue/38323[JENKINS-38323])


The "Artifacts" tab also now supports pagination, which allows developers to
paginate through the Artifacts tab. Previously, this list
was cut off at 100 entries.

== Improvements

We were able to include two performance improvements in 1.5.0 which reduce the
**Dashboard** loading time in Blue Ocean:

* link:https://issue-redirect.jenkins.io/issue/48868[JENKINS-48868]


Support for viewing output for failed runs with no stages is also included in
this release. For developers who have no stages/steps defined in their
pipelines, they can now see the full log output for failed runs. This update
helps with Pipeline debugging in Jenkins.

Further improving the log output for Pipeline Runs, 1.5.0 also improves viewing
of long log output lines with wrapping.  Previously, a single, long line of
output in the log wouldn't be fully visible in the log window.

== Fixes

One notable bug fix we addressed in this release was that `input` steps in
`post` directives would not properly prompt for input. By fixing

users of Declarative Pipeline with Blue Ocean can include `input` steps in
their `post` directives.
