Hello, I am Jenn, the new Product Manager for Blue Ocean and Jenkins
Pipeline at CloudBees. I am based out of the Seattle area and am excited to be
working on Jenkins. :D We released version 1.5.0 of the Blue Ocean plugin late last week. If you're
using Blue Ocean, you'll want to grab this update since it includes many
improvements and bug fixes!


== New Features

Blue Ocean now includes a user interface update to show the downstream jobs
launched with the 'build' step
(link: https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-38339[JENKINS-38339])

With Blue Ocean 1.5.0, users can now **Reorder Steps in the Blue Ocean Pipeline
Editor** simply by dragging and dropping steps to reorder them in the list of
steps.
(link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-38323[JENKINS-38323])


The "Artifacts" tab also now supports pagination, which allows developers to
paginate through the Artifacts tab. Previously, this list
was cut off at 100 entries.

== Improvements

We were able to include two performance improvements in 1.5.0 which reduce the
**Dashboard** loading time in Blue Ocean:

* link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-48868[JENKINS-48868]


Support for viewing output for failed runs with no stages is also included in
this release. For developers who have no stages/steps defined in their
pipelines, they can now see the full log output for failed runs. This update
helps with Pipeline debugging in Jenkins.
(link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-48074[JENKINS-48074])

Further improving the log output for Pipeline Runs, 1.5.0 also improves viewing
of long log output lines with wrapping.  Previously, a single, long line of
output in the log wouldn't be fully visible in the log window.

== Fixes

One notable bug fix we addressed in this release was that `input` steps in
`post` directives would not properly prompt for input. By fixing
link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-49297[JENKINS-49297]
users of Declarative Pipeline with Blue Ocean can include `input` steps in
their `post` directives.
