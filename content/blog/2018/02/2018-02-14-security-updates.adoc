We just released security updates to Jenkins, versions 2.107 and 2.89.4, that fix multiple security vulnerabilities.

For an overview of what was fixed, see the link:/security/advisory/2018-02-14[security advisory].
For an overview on the possible impact of these changes on upgrading Jenkins LTS, see our link:/doc/upgrade-guide/2.89/#upgrading-to-jenkins-lts-2-89-4[LTS upgrade guide].

IMPORTANT: While the severity score works out as _medium_ for all the vulnerabilities, we strongly recommend that anyone operating publicly accessible Jenkins instances update as soon as possible, as their secrets on disk might be at risk by SECURITY-705.
