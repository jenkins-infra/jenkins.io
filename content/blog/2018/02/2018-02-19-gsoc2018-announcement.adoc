We are happy to announce that Jenkins project has been accepted to
link:https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/[Google Summer of Code 2018].
This year we invite students and mentors to join the Jenkins community and work together
on various initiatives: core, plugins, development tools and infrastructure.

Our mentors have already created some link:/projects/gsoc/gsoc2018-project-ideas[project ideas].
For example, you are welcome to work on the new link:/projects/gsoc/gsoc2018-project-ideas/#jenkins-configuration-as-code[Configuration-as-Code initiative] or
to help link:/projects/gsoc/gsoc2018-project-ideas/#code-coverage-api-plugin[creating standard API for Code Coverage plugins].
If you like test automation, there is a proposal to
link:/projects/gsoc/gsoc2018-project-ideas/#improvements-to-the-jenkins-acceptance-test-harness[Jenkins Acceptance Test Harness].
Over the next weeks we plan to extend this list by new even more project ideas.

All information about the Jenkins GSoC is available on its link:/projects/gsoc/[subproject page].

== I am a student. How do I apply?

See link:/projects/gsoc/contributors[Information for students] for application guidelines.

First step is to join discussions in the mailing lists in order to introduce yourself, establish connections with the community and potential mentors.
The application period starts on March 12 and ends on March 27, but don't let it misguide you!
Use time before application to discuss project ideas/proposals with mentors and to process their feedback.
To create a better proposal, we also recommend to study Jenkins and to do some contributions in the area of your project proposal.

Not satisfied by the current link:/projects/gsoc/gsoc2018-project-ideas[project ideas]?
You can link:/projects/gsoc/gsoc2018-project-ideas/#proposing-new-project-ideas[propose your own idea]
in the developer mailing list.

== I want to be a mentor. Is it too late?

It's not!
If you are passionate about open-source and Jenkins, we invite you to join the mentors team.
You can either propose a new project idea or join an existing one.
See link:/blog/2018/01/06/gsoc2018-call-for-mentors[Call for Mentors] and link:/projects/gsoc/mentors[Information for mentors] for details.

This year mentorship does **NOT** require strong expertise in Jenkins development.
The objective is to guide students and to get involved into the Jenkins community.
GSoC org admins will help to find advisers if special expertise is required.

== Important dates

* Mar 05 - deadline for new GSoC project idea proposals
* Mar 12 - student application period starts
* Mar 27 - deadline for student applications
* Apr 23 - accepted projects announced, community bonding starts
* May 14 - coding period starts
* Aug 06 - end of the coding period

See the link:https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/#timeline[GSoC Timeline] for more info.
In the Jenkins project we will also organize special events during and after GSoC (e.g. at Jenkins world).

**P.S:** I am going to create a special GSoC 2018 edition of swags for mentors and students. Do not miss them ;)
