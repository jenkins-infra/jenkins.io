You've marked your calendar to alert you weeks in advance of the CFP deadline.
You've spent your nights and weekends to skillfully craft your abstract and you
are convinced this is THE one.  You confidently clicked the 'submit' button
only to find out weeks later you've received an automated declined email. On
top of feeling disappointed, you probably wondered why your proposal was turned
down.

As link:https://jenkinsworld2018cfp.hubb.me/Home/Dashboard[Jenkins World CFP]
is still open, we hope to demystify the selection process by offering a few
tips to help increase the chance of your proposal getting accepted.

=== Tip 1: Make your title concise and attention-grabbing

Thereâ€™s only a few seconds to make an impression with your proposal. Your title
and abstract should be succinct and attention grabbing. Think about what makes
your Jenkins proposal exceptional over others. What value will it bring to
attendees?

=== Tip 2: Know your audience

Jenkins World audiences want to learn and adopt the newest development
practices, process, languages and frameworks. They are highly technical and are
interested in deep technical talks that are original and offers valuable
information.

=== Tip 3: Transformational user stories

Share your unique Jenkins project experiences, challenges, strategies, lessons
learned, and outcome. What can you share with your audience that will
facilitate knowledge transfer and development of new and innovative techniques?

=== Tip 4: Topic should be relevant and applicable

Consider how to make the topic more broadly applicable to the attendees, such
as with a hands-on demo explaining the concept. By showcasing innovative
methods that draw out relevant and compelling knowledge to the audience,
everybody is likely to more thoroughly absord the content of the talk. Also,
who doesn't love a cool demo?

=== Tip 5: Got Tips & Tricks?

Jenkins is used tons of different ways.  Sharing novel approaches, tips, or
tricks for increased efficiency and proficiency with Jenkins is almost always
well received!
