== Jenkins X uses Capabilities identified by the "Accelerate:  The Science Behind Devops" 

link:https://jenkins-x.io/[Jenkins X] is a reimagined CI/CD implementation for the Cloud which is heavily influence by the 
link:https://puppet.com/resources/whitepaper/state-of-devops-report[State of DevOps reports] and more recently the book
"Accelerate: The Science Behind Devops" by

Years of gathering data from real world teams and organisations which has been analyzed by inspiring thought leaders and data 
scientists from the DevOps world, "Accelerate" recommends a number of capabilities that Jenkins X is implementing so 
users gain the scientifically proven benefits, out of the box. We’ve started documenting the capabilities that are available 
today and will continue as more become available.

=== Use version control for all artifacts

The Weaveworks folks coined the term GitOps which we love.  Any change to an environment, whether it be a new application, 
version upgrade, resource limit change or simple application configuration should be raised as a Pull Request to Git, have 
checks run against it like a form of CI for environments and approved by a team that has control over what goes into the 
related environment.  We can now enable governance and have full traceability for any change to an environment.

=== Automate your deployment process

==== Environments

Jenkins X will automatically create Git backed environments during installation and makes it easy to add new ones using 
`jx create environment`.  Additionally when creating new applications via a quickstart (`jx create quickstart`), Java based 
SpringBoot (`jx create spring`) or importing existing applications (`jx import`), Jenkins X will both automatically add 
CI / CD pipelines and setup the jobs, git repos and webhooks to enable an automated deployment process.

Out of the box Jenkins X creates Staging and Production (this is customisable) permanent environments as well as temporary 
environments for preview applications from Pull Requests.

===== Previews Environments

We are trying to move as much testing, security, validation and experimentation for a change before it's merged to master.  
With the use of temporary dynamically created Preview Environments any pull request can have a preview version built and 
deployed, including libraries that feed into a downstream deployable application.  This means we can code review, test, 
collaborate better with all teams that are involved in agreeing that change can go live.

Ultimately Jenkins X wants to provide a way that developers, testers, designers and product managers can be as sure as they 
can that when a change is merged to master it works as expected.  We want to be confident the proposed change does not 
negatively affect any service or feature as well as deliver the value it is intended to.

Where Preview Environments get really interesting is when we are able to progress a PR through various stages of maturity and 
confidence where we begin to direct a percentage of real production traffic like beta users to it.  We can then analyse the 
value of the proposed change and possible run multiple automated experiments over time using Hypothesis Driven Development.  
This helps give us better understanding of how the change will perform when released to all users.

Using preview environments is a great way to introduce better test automation.  While Jenkins X enables this we don't yet 
have examples of automated tests being run against a preview environment.  A simple test would be to ensure the application 
starts ok and Kubernetes liveness check pass for an amount of time. This relates to

===== Permanent Environments

In software development we're used to working with multiple environments in the lead up to a change being promoted to a live 
production environment.  Whilst this seems business as usual it can cause significant delays to other changes if for any 
reason that it is deemed not fit via some process that didn't happen pre merge to master.  Subsequent commits then become 
blocked and can cause delay of urgent changes being promoted to production.

As above Jenkins X wants any changes and experiments to be validated before it is merged to master.  We would like changes in 
a staging environment to be held there for a short amount of time before being promoted, ideally in an automated fashion.

The default Jenkins X pipelines provide deployment automation via environments.  These are customisable to suite your own 
CI / CD pipeline requirements.

Jenkins X recommends Staging should act as a near as possible reflection on production, ideally with real production data 
shadowed to it using a service mesh to understand the behaviour.  This also helps when developing changes in preview where we 
can link to non production services in staging.

=== Use trunk-based development

The Accelerate book found that teams which use trunk based development with short lived branches performed better.  This has 
always worked for the Jenkins X core team members so this was an easy capability for Jenkins X to implement when setting up 
Git repositories and CI/CD jobs.

=== Implement Continuous Integration

Jenkins X sees CI as the effort of validating a proposed change via pull requests before it is merged to master.  Jenkins X 
will automatically configure source code repositories, Jenkins and Kubernetes to provide Continuous Integration of the box.

=== Implement Continuous Delivery

Jenkins X sees CD as the effort of taking that change after it's been merged to master through to running in a live 
environment.  Jenkins X automates many parts in a release pipeline:

Jenkins X advocates the use of semantic versioning.  We use git tags to calculate the next release version which means we 
don't need to store the latest release version in the master branch.  Where release systems do store the last or next version 
in Git repos it means CD becomes hard, as a commit in a release pipeline back to master triggers a new release.  This results 
in a recursive release trigger.  Using a Git tag helps avoid this situation which Jenkins X completely automates.

Jenkins X will automatically create a released version on __every__ merge to master which can then potentially progress 
through to production.

=== Use loosely coupled architecture

By targeting Kubernetes users of Jenkins X can take advantage of many of the cloud features that help design and develop 
loosely coupled solutions.  Service discovery, fault tolerance, scalability, health checks, rolling upgrades, container 
scheduling and orchestration to name just a few examples of where Kubernetes helps.

=== Architect for empowered teams

Jenkins X aims to help polyglot application developers.  Right now Jenkins X has quickstarts and automated CI/CD setup with 
language detection for Golang, Java, NodeJS, .Net, React, Angular, Rust, Swift and more to come.  What this also does is 
provide a consistent Way of Working so developers can concentrate on developing.

Jenkins X also provides many addons, for example Grafana and Prometheus for automated metrics collection and visualisation.  
In this example centralised metrics help understand how your applications behave when built and deployed on Kubernetes.

link:https://jenkins-x.io/developing/devpods[DevPods] are another feature which enables developers to edit source code in their 
local IDE, behind the scenes it is then synced to the cloud and rapidly built and redeployed.

Jenkins X believes providing developers automation that helps them experiment in the cloud, with different technologies and 
feedback empowers them to make the best decisions - faster.

== Fancy a closer look?

link:https://twitter.com/rajdavies[Rob Davies] are going to be presenting and running workshops at 
link:https://www.cloudbees.com/devops-world[DevOps World  | Jenkins World].  We'll also be hanging out at the Jenkins X demo 
area so come and say hello and see what's the latest cool and exiting things to come out of Jenkins X.  Use *JWFOSS* for 30%

== Want to get involved? 

Jenkins X is open source, the community mainly hangs out in the 
link:https://jenkins-x.io/community/[Jenkins X Kubernetes slack channels] and for tips on being more involved with Jenkins X 
take a look at our link:https://jenkins-x.io/contribute[contributing docs].  We've been helping lots of folks get into open source, learn 
new technoligies and languages like golang.  Why not get involved?
