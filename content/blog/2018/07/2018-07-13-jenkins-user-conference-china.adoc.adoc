On June 30, 2018 in sunny Beijing, the capital of China, we welcomed over 200 attendees to Jenkins User Conference China (JUCC). This is the first JUCC in Beijing and we are overwhelmed by the interest and love for Jenkins. The conference had sessions in DevOps, Continuous Delivery, Jenkins X, Pipeline, and Container. The GreatOps community, event host, invited John Willis, a thought leader of DevOps to deliver the keynote speech. John’s topic was "DevOps: Almost 10 years - What A  Strange Long Trip It’s Been." It was very insightful to learn of the history of DevOps and John's point of view on the practice.

After James’ presentation, there were many questions about Jenkins X, Jenkins users in China are very interested in Jenkins X. We all posed Jenkins "X" gesture.
