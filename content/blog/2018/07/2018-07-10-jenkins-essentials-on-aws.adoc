TIP: _Jenkins Essentials_ has been renamed to _Jenkins **Evergreen**_ since this was written.

Jenkins Essentials is about providing a link:/blog/2018/04/06/jenkins-essentials/[distribution of Jenkins in less than five minutes and five clicks].
One of the main ideas to make this a reality is that Jenkins will be autoconfigured with sane defaults for the environment it is running in.

We are happy to report we recently merged the link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/evergreen/pull/128[change that provides this feature for AWS].
We use an _link:https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation[AWS CloudFormation template]_ to provision a working version of _Jenkins Essentials_, automatically configured to:

* dynamically provision EC2 agents, using the link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/ec2[EC2 plugin];
* use the link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/artifact-manager-s3[Artifact Manager on S3] plugin, so that artifacts are not stored anymore on the controller's file system, but directly in an S3 bucket.

I recorded a short demo video last week showing the basics of this:

While there are still many items to complete to provide a usable version for end-users, we are making steady progress towards it.
