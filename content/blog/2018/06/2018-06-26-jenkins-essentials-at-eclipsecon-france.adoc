TIP: _Jenkins Essentials_ has been renamed to _Jenkins **Evergreen**_ since this was written.

It's been far too long since we posted an update on
link:/blog/2018/04/06/jenkins-essentials/[Jenkins Essentials]. While it's not
quite ready for users to start trying it out, we
continue link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/evergreen[hacking away] on all
manner of changes to support the safe and automatic upgrades of a running
Jenkins environment. In the meantime, Jenkins contributor
link:https://github.com/batmat[Baptiste Mathus] took some time to introduce and
_demonstrate_ Jenkins Essentials at the recently held
link:https://www.eclipsecon.org[EclipseCon] France,

From the talk's abstract:

_The Jenkins Project is working on providing its users with a brand new,
strongly opinionated, and continuously delivered distribution of Jenkins:
Jenkins Essentials. Constantly self-updating, including auto-rollback, with
an aggressive subset of verified plugins._

_In this talk, we will detail how this works: how we run and upgrade Jenkins
itself. How instances are continuously sending health data back to help
automated decision-making about the quality of given new release, and decide to
generalize a given version of Jenkins to the whole fleet, or roll it back._

_We will end giving an overview of the status of the project: how it's managed
in a fully open manner, from design to code and its infrastructure, and all the
radical solutions to imagine and the upcoming challenges for the next months._

I hope you enjoy the video
