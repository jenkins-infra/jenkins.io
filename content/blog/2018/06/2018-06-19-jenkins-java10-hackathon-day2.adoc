This week we have a
link:/blog/2018/06/08/jenkins-java10-hackathon/[Jenkins & Java 10 Online Hackathon].
This is an open online event, where we work together on Jenkins core and plugins in order
to find and fix compatibility issues, share experiences and have some fun.
Everybody is welcome to join, independently of their Jenkins experience and amount of time they have available.

After the link:https://youtu.be/1HrgWs0l0e8[kick off] on Monday
Jenkins contributors have been working on Java 10 and Java 11 support in Jenkins.
We have already received contributions from 12 hackathon participants, and the number keeps growing.
There are still 3 days ahead, but we have already achieved some important results we want to share.

### Jenkins Pipeline

One of our major efforts over last 2 days was to get Jenkins Pipeline working on
Java 10+.
When the hackathon started Jenkins Pipeline was not working at all,
and it was a major blocker for Java support and for exploratory testing in particular.
We've been working together with Sam van Oort and Devin Nusbaum to fix the libraries in
the Jenkins core, Pipeline: Support plugin and Docker packaging.

Just to summarize the result of two days in one screenshot...

image:/images/post-images/2018-06-19-java10-hackathon-day-2/successful-pipeline.png[Successful Pipeline on Java 10, role=center]

Yes, we have got it running!
Over two days we have got from the "Pipeline Crashes Immediately"
state to the situation when the most of key Pipeline features are operational,
including Scripted and Declarative Pipeline, Blue Ocean, shared libraries and
dozens of plugins being used in the Jenkins plugin build flow.

There is still a lot of work to do to get the changes finalized,
but Jenkins Pipeline is available for testing on Java 10 and 11 now.
If you want to try it out, you can use a new `jenkins/jenkins-experimental:blueocean-jdk10`
image we have created.
It bundles all the required patches, so you can just run the following command to get started:

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins/jenkins-experimental:blueocean-jdk10
```

If you want to try more complex scenarios, see the

### What else?

Although Pipeline is the most visible change,
there are other ongoing activities:

* Devin Nusbaum explored plugin startup issues we had with JDK 11ea+17
  and confirmed that we need to upgrade our images to JDK 11ea+18
* Gianpaolo Macario is working on adopting the Java 10 experimental images in his
link:https://github.com/gmacario/easy-jenkins[easy-jenkins] project
* Sam van Oort and Devin Nusbaum are working on getting plugin build and test flows
when using JDK 10 with Maven
* Nicolas de Loof is working on cleaning up Illegal reflective access warnings in Jenkins components,
using the new link:https://github.com/ndeloof/fields[Fields] micro-library
* Olivier Lamy and Nicolas de Loof are updating the
link:https://www.mojohaus.org/animal-sniffer/[Animal Sniffer] plugin for Maven
to make it compatible with Java 9 and above
* Kohsuke Kawaguchi has released a repackaged version of link:https://asm.ow2.io/[ASM 6.2] we use in the project
* Last but not least, Liam Newman and Tracy Miranda helped us a lot to run the meetings
 and to get this hackathon organized

There are also other contributors working on exploratory testing and reporting
defects they discover.
See link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ed6wFOlq4cWrSL6UkCSzFbaY80AT-sk8ncB4Fz5QXyM/edit#heading=h.g8c0opr42807[our status doc]
