As you probably know, we will have a
link:/blog/2018/06/08/jenkins-java10-hackathon/[Jenkins and Java 10+ online hackathon] this week.
In order to enable early adopters to try out Jenkins with new Java versions,
we have updated Jenkins core and Docker packages.
Starting from link:/changelog/#v2.127[Jenkins 2.127],
weekly releases can be launched with Java 10 and Java 11 (preview).
Although there are some known compatibility issues,
the packages are ready for evaluation and exploratory testing.

This article explains how to run Jenkins with Java 10 and 11 using Docker images and WAR files.
It also lists known issues and provides contributor guidelines.

=== Running in Docker

In order to simplify testing, we have created a new
link:https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jenkins-experimental/[jenkins/jenkins-experimental]
repository on DockerHub.
This repository includes various Jenkins Core images, including Java 10 and Java 11 images.
We have also set up development branches and continuous delivery flows for Jenkins core,
so now we can deliver patches for these images without waiting for weekly releases.

You can run the image simply as:

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins/jenkins-experimental:latest-jdk11
```

The following tags are available:

* `2.127-jdk10`, `2.128-jdk10` - Weekly releases packaged with Java 10
* `2.127-jdk11`, `2.128-jdk11` - Weekly releases packaged with Java 11
* `latest-jdk10` - Jenkins core build from the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/tree/java10-support[java10-support] branch
* `latest-jdk11` - Automatic build from the core's link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/tree/java11-support[java11-support] branch.
* `blueocean-jdk10`, `blueocean-jdk11` - Experimental build, which bundles all Jenkins Pipeline and
Blue Ocean patches required to run on Java 11.
If you want to try Pipeline, use this image

Java 10/11 images are fully compatible with the official
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker/blob/master/README.md[jenkins/jenkins]
Docker image documentation,
e.g. you can use `plugins.txt` to install plugins, mount volumes and pass extra options via environment variables.

=== Running Jenkins without Docker

==== Java 10

1. Download Jenkins WAR for 2.127 or above
(or build the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/tree/java10-support[experimental branch])
2. Run WAR with the following command:

```shell
${JAVA10_HOME}/bin/java --add-modules java.xml.bind -jar jenkins.war \
    --enable-future-java --httpPort=8080 --prefix=/jenkins
```

==== Java 11

1. Download Jenkins WAR for 2.127 or above
(or build the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/tree/java11-support[experimental branch])
2. Download the following libraries to the same directory as jenkins.war
** link:https://central.maven.org/maven2/javax/xml/bind/jaxb-api/2.3.0/jaxb-api-2.3.0.jar[jaxb-api-2.3.0.jar] (save as jaxb-api.jar)
** link:https://central.maven.org/maven2/com/sun/xml/bind/jaxb-core/2.3.0.1/jaxb-core-2.3.0.1.jar[jaxb-core-2.3.0.1.jar] (save as jaxb-core.jar)
** link:https://central.maven.org/maven2/com/sun/xml/bind/jaxb-impl/2.3.0.1/jaxb-impl-2.3.0.1.jar[jaxb-impl-2.3.0.1.jar] (save as jaxb-impl.jar)
** https://github.com/javaee/activation/releases/download/JAF-1_2_0/javax.activation.jar[javax.activation v.1.2.0]  (save as javax.activation.jar)
3. Run the following command:

```shell
Run Jenkins with ${JAVA11_HOME}/bin/java \
    -p jaxb-api.jar:javax.activation.jar --add-modules java.xml.bind,java.activation \
    -cp jaxb-core.jar:jaxb-impl.jar \
    -jar jenkins.war --enable-future-java --httpPort=8080 --prefix=/jenkins
```

=== Current state

As of June 17, we have achieved the following state:

* Jenkins 2.127+ starts up successfully with
link:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/10-0-1-relnotes-4308875.html[OpenJDK 10.0.1] and
OpenJDK 11+17-Debian-2 (preview)
* It is possible to configure and run simple Freestyle jobs
* Jenkins agents are able to start on Java 10, to connect to the master and to execute Freestyle jobs
* Agents can be connected using plugin:docker-plugin[Docker Plugin] and plugin:yet-another-docker-plugin[Yet Another Docker Plugin]
* plugin:job-dsl[Job DSL plugin] works well on demo projects
* plugin:maven-plugin[Maven Integration plugin] can build
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-pom[plugin-pom]-based
Jenkins plugins when running on agents with JDK 8
* It is possible to create plugin:cloudbees-folder[Folders] and manage items in them
* It is possible to configure Jenkins using link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin[Configuration-as-Code plugin]
* Jenkins is able to execute Groovy scripts in _Script Console_ and
link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Groovy+Hook+Script[Groovy Hooks]

=== Known issues

So far we know about the following issues:

* Pipeline crashes immediately on Java 10 and 11 (link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-46602[JENKINS-46602])
** Workaround: _Pipeline: Support_ plugin should be updated to version 3.0-java11-alpha-1-rc684.d802f5d9aeed from the Incrementals repo
    (link:https://repo.jenkins-ci.org/incrementals/org/jenkins-ci/plugins/workflow/workflow-support/2.19-rc295.e017dc58c0a3/[download])
* *FIXED* - Git Client plugin 2.7.2 cannot be installed when running with Java 11 build 18ea
* There are many warnings about Illegal reflective access during execution
(linked in link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-40689[JENKINS-40689]).
** In current Java 10 and 11 releases it does not lead to failures,
but we want to cleanup these warnings anyway
* *FIXED* - link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin[Configuration-as-Code plugin] fails to export configurations on Java 10
(link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-51991[JENKINS-51991])

We anticipate to discover and report more issues during the hackathon this week.

=== Contributing

If you discover incompatibilities in plugins, please
link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/How+to+report+an+issue[report issues in our bugtracker].
We have `java10` and `java11` labels for such issues.

If you are interested to try out Jenkins with Java 10 and 11 before June 22nd,
you may be interested to sign-up to the link:/blog/2018/06/08/jenkins-java10-hackathon/[Jenkins and Java 10+ online hackathon].
Everybody is welcome to join, independently of their Jenkins experience and amount of time they have available.
Exploratory testing is also within the hackathon's scope.
During this event, please also use the `java10_hackathon` label.
It will help us to track contributions and send folks some small "thank you" gifts for participating (details will be figured out during the hackathon).

If you want to contribute patches to the core,
please submit pull requests to link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/tree/java10-support[java10-support] or
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/tree/java11-support[java11-support] branches.
If the patches are compatible with Java 8, we will try to upstream them to weekly releases.
For plugin patches please create pull requests against main branches and then follow guidelines from plugin maintainers.
If you need additional reviews and you are a member of the `jenkinsci` organization,
feel free to mention the `@jenkinsci/java10-support` team in your PRs.
