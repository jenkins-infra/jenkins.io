Hi all, this is my first blogpost on jenkins.io.
My name is Kseniia Nenasheva, I work as a Graphics Designer at CloudBees.
I have been using Jenkins since 2012 as a QA engineer, and I am happy to contribute to the project.
I have also submitted some patches to the core and plugins,
and probably you have seen some Jenkins logos link:/artwork[created by me],
and some of you may even have them on your laptops.
By the way, Ron Burgundy is my favorite Jenkins logo.

This year I am going to DevOps World | Jenkins World in San Francisco.
During the conference I will be working at the Jenkins community booth
and creating exclusive pictures with conference visitors and one of the Jenkins heroes.
So, if you come to our booth and share your Jenkins story, you can get a special picture.

If you are interested to get a logo for your link:/projects/jam/[Jenkins Area Meetup]
or an open-source project (including Jenkins plugins, of course),
please also stop by at the booth and share your ideas.
After the conference I will try to implement the most interesting proposals.

You can also meet me at the contributor summit on September 17.
