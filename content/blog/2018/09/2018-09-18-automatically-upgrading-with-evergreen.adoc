When I first link:/blog/2018/04/06/jenkins-essentials/[wrote about Jenkins
Evergreen], which was then referred to as "Jenkins Essentials", I mentioned a
number of future developments which in the subsequent months have become
_reality_. At this year's DevOps World - Jenkins World in San Francisco, I will
be sharing more details on the philosophy behind Jenkins Evergreen, show off
how far we have come, and discuss where we're going with this radical
distribution of Jenkins.

As discussed in my first blog post, and
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/300[JEP-300],
the first two pillars of Jenkins Evergreen have been the primary focus of our
efforts.

=== Automatically Updated Distribution

Perhaps unsurprisingly, implementing the mechanisms necessary for safely and
automatically updating a Jenkins distribution, which includes core and plugins,
was and continues to be a sizable amount of work. In
link:/blog/2018/09/13/speaker-blog-evergreen-safely-upgrading/[Baptiste's talk]
he will be speaking about the details which make Evergreen "go" whereas
I will be speaking about _why_ an automatically updating distribution is
important.

As continuous integration and continuous delivery have become more commonplace,
and fundamental to modern software engineering, Jenkins tends to live two
different lifestyles depending on the organization. In some organizations,
Jenkins is managed and deployed methodically with automation tools like Chef,
Puppet, etc. In many other organizations however, Jenkins is treated much more
like an _appliance_, not unlike the office wireless router. Installed and so
long as it continues to do its job, people won't think about it too much.

Jenkins Evergreen's distribution makes the "Jenkins as an Appliance" model much
better for everybody by ensuring the latest feature updates, bug and security
fixes are always installed in Jenkins.

Additionally, I believe Evergreen will serve another group we don't adequately
serve at the moment: those who want Jenkins to behave much more like a
_service_. We typically don't consider "versions" of GitHub.com, we receive
incremental updates to the site and realize the benefits of GitHub's on-going
development without ever thinking about an "upgrade."

I believe Jenkins Evergreen can, and will provide that same experience.


=== Automatic Sane Defaults

The really powerful thing about Jenkins as a platform is the broad variety of
patterns and practices different organizations may adopt. For newer users, or
users with common use-cases, that significant amount of flexibility can result
in a paradox of choice. With Jenkins Evergreen, much of the most common
configuration is automatically configured out of the box.

Included is Jenkins Pipeline and Blue Ocean, by default. We also removed some
legacy functionalities from Jenkins while we were at it.

We are also utilizing some of the fantastic 
link:/projects/jcasc/[Configuration as Code]
work, which recently had its 1.0 release, to automatically set sane defaults in
Jenkins Evergreen. 

== Status Quo

The effort has made significant strides thus far this year, and we're really
excited for people to start trying out Jenkins Evergreen. As of today,

is ready for _early adopters_. We **do not** yet recommend using Jenkins
Evergreen for a production environment.
