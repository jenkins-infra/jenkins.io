Next week link:https://devopsworldjenkinsworld2018.sched.com/speaker/olivier_vernin.71uu3o1[Olivier Vernin] from CloudBees and link:https://devopsworldjenkinsworld2018.sched.com/speaker/brian_benz.1yikcdif[Brian Benz] from Microsoft will be presenting a session at link:https://www.cloudbees.com/devops-world[DevOps World | Jenkins World] about how Microsoft has been working with Jenkins to build Jenkins plugins and produce Jenkins on Microsoft Azure.  
These plugins run Jenkins on Azure Linux and Windows VMs, Kubernetes, azure App service, as well as deploy artifacts to those Azure platforms and more.  
All are open source and available on GitHub.

Here's our session, where we'll be sharing successes and challenges of getting the infrastructure up and running:

Tuesday, September 18

*link:https://sched.co/G4qe[Session: Developing and Delivering Jenkins in the cloud]*
11:15am - 12:00pm link:https://devopsworldjenkinsworld2018.sched.com/speaker/brian_benz.1yikcdif[Brian Benz] with link:https://devopsworldjenkinsworld2018.sched.com/speaker/olivier_vernin.71uu3o1[Olivier Vernin], CloudBees

In this session, we'll discuss the real-life implementation of Jenkins' development and delivery infrastructure in the cloud as it has evolved from a mix of platforms to Microsoft Azure.
Expect a frank discussion of how issues that were encountered along the way were overcome, how the architecture has evolved, and what's on the roadmap.
We'll share important tips and tricks for implementing your own Jenkins infrastructure on any cloud, based on Jenkins' own experience with their implementation.

See you in San Francisco!
