Happy 2018! The Jenkins World train is ready to take off once again. As usual, the sign of festivities looming begins with the Call for Papers.  Those who attended Jenkins World 2017 know that Jenkins World 2018 is coming back to San Francisco. But what they did not know is that Jenkins World will also be coming to Europe. You read that right, Jenkins World is taking place in two locations in 2018:

To encourage open collaboration and stimulate discussions that will help advance Jenkins adoption and drive it forward, we invite Jenkins users, developers and industry experts to submit a speaking proposal to Jenkins World San Francisco and or Europe.
