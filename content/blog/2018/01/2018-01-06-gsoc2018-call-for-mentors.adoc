This year the Jenkins project is interested in participating in
link:https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/[Google Summer of Code (GSoC)].
As in 2016/2017, we are looking for mentors.
So yes, we are looking for you :)

== What is GSoC?

GSoC is an annual international program which encourages
college-aged students to participate with open source projects during the summer
break between classes.

Students accepted into the program receive a stipend,
paid by Google, to work on well-defined projects to improve or enhance the Jenkins
project.
In exchange, numerous Jenkins community members volunteer as _mentors_
for students to help integrate them into the open source community and succeed
in completing their summer projects.

== What do mentors get?

* A student who works full-time in the area of your interest for several months
* Joint projects with Jenkins experts, lots of fun and ability to study something together
* Limited-edition of swags from Google and Jenkins project
* Maybe: Participation in GSoC Mentor Summit and other GSoC events/meetups

== Conditions

Mentors are expected to...

* Be passionate about Jenkins
* Lead the project in the area of their interest
* Actively participate in the project during student selection, community bonding and coding phases (March - August)
* Work in teams of 2+ mentors per 1 each student
* Dedicate a consistent and significant amount of time, especially during the coding phase (_~5 hours_ per week in a team of two mentors)

Mentorship does **NOT** require strong expertise in Jenkins plugin development.
The main objective is to guide students and to get them involved into the Jenkins community.
GSoC org admins will help to find advisors if a special expertise is needed.

[NOTE]
====
**Disclaimer:** We cannot guarantee that the Jenkins organization gets accepted to GSoC.
Even if it gets accepted, we may need to select projects depending on student applications
and the number of allocated project slots.

=== Timeline

* Dec 2017 - started collecting project ideas
* Jan 17 - Status review at the link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Governance+Meeting+Agenda[Jenkins Governance Meeting].

== How to apply?

If you are interested in proposing a project or joining an existing one, please respond to
link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/We-14-z_YXU[this thread]
in the Jenkins Developer mailing list.
We aggregate/review proposals in
link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q2p_XZEdbkcVDMpEPTtjPS15i2Oq3CQgH_geJjPhofY/edit[this document]
where you just need to describe the idea and introduce yourself.

Please propose new project ideas for discussion until March 05.
You can join an existing project at any time, including community bonding and coding periods.

=== Project requirements

* GSoC is about code (though it may and likely should include some documentation and testing work)
* Projects should be about Jenkins (plugins, core, infrastructure, integrations, etc.)
* Projects should be potentially doable by a student in 3-4 months

You can find more information about requirements and practices in the
link:https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/[GSoC Mentor Guide].
