[NOTE]
====
There is a newer version of the announcement for Jenkins administrators.
Please see link:/blog/2018/03/15/jep-200-lts/[this blogpost].
====

== Overview

link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/200/README.adoc[JEP-200] has been integrated into Jenkins weekly builds
and (if all goes well) will be a part of the next LTS line.
In a nutshell, this change is a security hardening measure
to be less permissive about deserializing Java classes defined in the Java Platform or libraries bundled with Jenkins.
For several years now, Jenkins has specifically _blacklisted_ certain classes and packages according to known or suspected exploits;
now it will reject all classes not explicitly mentioned in a _whitelist_, or defined in Jenkins core or plugins.

== For Jenkins administrators

=== Before upgrade

Back up your Jenkins instance prior to upgrade so you have any easy way of rolling back.
If you are running any of the plugins listed in
link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Plugins+affected+by+fix+for+JEP-200[Plugins affected by fix for JEP-200],
update them after taking the backup but before upgrading Jenkins core.

If you have a way of testing the upgrade in an isolated environment before applying it to production,
do so now.

Using backups and a staging server is good advice before _any_ upgrade but especially this one,
with a relatively high risk of regression.

=== After upgrade

To the extent that advance testing of the impact of this change on popular plugins has been completed,
most users (and even plugin developers) should not notice any difference.
If you do encounter a `java.lang.SecurityException: Rejected: some.pkg.and.ClassName` in the Jenkins UI or logs,
you may have found a case where an unusual plugin, or an unusual usage mode of a common plugin,
violates the existing whitelist.
This will be visible in the Jenkins system log as a message from `jenkins.security.ClassFilterImpl` like the following:

----
some.pkg.and.ClassName in file:/var/lib/jenkins/plugins/some-plugin-name/WEB-INF/lib/some-library-1.2.jar might be dangerous, so rejecting; see https://jenkins.io/redirect/class-filter/
----

where the link would direct you here.

If you find such a case, please report it in the Jenkins issue tracker, under the appropriate plugin component.
Link it to link:https://issue-redirect.jenkins.io/issue/47736[JENKINS-47736] and add the `JEP-200` label.
If at all possible, include complete steps to reproduce the problem from scratch.
Jenkins developers will strive to evaluate the reason for the violation and offer a fix in the form of a core and/or plugin update.
For more details and current status, see
link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Plugins+affected+by+fix+for+JEP-200[Plugins affected by fix for JEP-200].

Assuming you see no particular reason to think that the class in question has dangerous deserialization semantics, which is rare,
it is possible to work around the problem in your own installation as a temporary expedient.
Simply make note of any class name(s) mentioned in such log messages,
and run Jenkins with this startup option (details will depend on your installation method):

----
-Dhudson.remoting.ClassFilter=some.pkg.and.ClassName,some.pkg.and.OtherClassName
----

== For plugin developers

=== Testing plugins against Jenkins 2.102 and above

As a plugin developer encountering this kind of error,
your first task is to ensure that it is reproducible in a functional (`JenkinsRule`) test
when running Jenkins 2.102 or newer to reproduce the error.

[source,sh]
----
mvn test -Djenkins.version=2.102 -Denforcer.skip=true
----

The above assumes you are using a recent 2.x or 3.x parent link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-pom[Plugin POM].
For certain cases you may need to use link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-compat-tester[Plugin Compat Tester (PCT)]
to run tests against Jenkins core versions newer than your baseline.

Running PCT against the latest Jenkins core:

[source,sh]
----
java -jar pct-cli.jar -reportFile $(pwd)/out/pct-report.xml \
    -workDirectory $(pwd)/work -skipTestCache true -mvn $(which mvn) \
    -includePlugins ${ARTIFACT_ID} -localCheckoutDir ${YOUR_PLUGIN_REPO}
----

You may need to run tests using an agent or force saves of plugin settings.

For maven plugins you can also specify custom Jenkins versions in `Jenkinsfile` to run tests against JEP-200:

[source,groovy]
----
buildPlugin(jenkinsVersions: [null, '2.102'])
----

(again picking whatever version you need to test against)
so that the test is included during CI builds, even while your minimum core baseline predates JEP-200.

If your plugins are built with Gradle, your mileage may vary.

=== Making plugins compatible with Jenkins 2.102 or above

If you discover a compatibility issue in your plugin,
you then have several choices for fixing the problem:

* Ideally, simplify your code so that the mentioned class is not deserialized via Jenkins Remoting or XStream to begin with:
** If the problem occurred when receiving a response from an agent, change your `Callable` (or `FileCallable`) to return a plainer type.
** If the problem occurred when saving an XML file (such as a `config.xml` or `build.xml`), use a plainer type in non-`transient` fields in your persistable plugin classes.
* If the class(es) are defined in the Java Platform or some library bundled in Jenkins core, propose a pull request adding it to `core/src/main/resources/jenkins/security/whitelisted-classes.txt` in `jenkinsci/jenkins`.
* If the class(es) are defined in a third-party library bundled in your plugin, create a resource file `META-INF/hudson.remoting.ClassFilter` listing them. (link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-support-plugin/pull/50/files[example])
** You may also do this for Java or Jenkins core library classes, as a hotfix until your core baseline includes the whitelist entry proposed above.
* If the class(es) are defined in a JAR you build and then bundle in your plugin’s `*.jpi`, add a `Jenkins-ClassFilter-Whitelisted: true` manifest entry. This whitelists every class in the JAR. (link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/lib-jenkins-maven-embedder/pull/15/files[example])
