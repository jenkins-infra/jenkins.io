NOTE: link:https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/[Google Summer of Code]
is as program where students are paid a stipend by Google to work on a free open source project like Jenkins,
at full-time for four months (May to August).
Mentors get actively involved with students starting at the end of February when students start to apply
(see the link:https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline[timeline]).

We are looking for mentors and project ideas to participate in the 15th edition of the Google Summer of Code program!
We have until February 6th, 2019 at 8pm UTC to submit the application on behalf the Jenkins Organization, but obviously,
we want to be ready before that.

The first step in the process is to have mentors and project ideas.
Then we will apply to Google.
We need Google to accept Jenkins' application to the program itself.
And for this to happen, *we need project proposals and mentors*.

We currently have a link:/projects/gsoc/2019/project-ideas[list of project idea proposals],
and we are looking for new project proposals, mentors, technical advisers, and subject matter experts.
GSoC projects may be about anything around code: new features, plugins, test frameworks, infrastructure, etc., etc.

Making a project idea proposal is easy, you can read the instructions link:/projects/gsoc/proposing-project-ideas[here].
Quick start:

1. Copy the link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l5SdcLnlCwWA6qH8FKT9XC714Dl1XJ9lyy1CKDdKKAU[project proposal template], 
add a short description of your project idea 
2. Open the document for public view and comments, reference communication channels there (if any)
3. Let us know about the project idea via link:https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#jenkinsci_gsoc-sig:gitter.im[our gitter channel].
4. After getting initial feedback from org admins, share your idea with other contributors who might be interested 
(via the link:https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-dev[developer mailing list], link:/chat[chats], or link:/sigs[special interest groups])

Potential mentors are invited to read the link:/projects/gsoc/mentors[information for mentors] for more information about the project.
Note that being a GSoC mentor does not require expert knowledge of Jenkins.
GSoC org admins will help to find technical advisors, so you can study together with your students.

Mentoring takes about 5 to 6 hours of work per week (more at the start, less at the end).
In return, a student works on your project full time for four months.
Think about the projects that you've always wanted to do but could not find the time...
There are also many opportunities to engage with the Jenkins community (meetups, knowledge sharing, communications) and with other projects (e.g. link:/blog/2018/11/13/martinda-gsoc-mentor-summit-experience/[going to the GSoC Mentor Summit]).
GSoC is a pretty good return on the investment!

For any question, you can find the GSoC admins,
mentors and participants on the link:https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#jenkinsci_gsoc-sig:gitter.im[GSoC SIG Gitter chat].
