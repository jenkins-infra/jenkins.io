If you are interested to learn more, please see the blog post below.

== Governance Board election details

This year we had link:/blog/2020/10/28/election-candidates/#governance-board[nine candidates] participating in Jenkins Governance Board elections: 
Andrey Falko, Ewelina Wilkosz, Frederic Gurr, Gavin Mogan, Justin Harringa,
Mark Waite, Marky Jackson, Steven Terrana, and Zhao Xiaojie (Rick).
All of them are awesome community leaders who actively contribute to the Jenkins project and
represent its users.
It would be an honor to have them on the Jenkins board.
Regardless of the election results, we appreciate their participation and the time they invested in these elections.

This year we were electing 2 governance board members.
We were using the https://civs.cs.cornell.edu/[Condorcet Internet Voting Service] that allows voters to rank their choices rather than just picking their one favorite choice.
You can find full voting results link:https://civs.cs.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/results.pl?id=E_f622a8a94f337478[here]:

1. Mark Waite  (Condorcet winner: wins contests with all other choices)
2. **Marky Jackson**  loses to Mark Waite by 48–12
3. **Gavin Mogan**  loses to Mark Waite by 51–10, loses to Marky Jackson by 31–20
4. Ewelina Wilkosz  loses to Mark Waite by 48–14, loses to Gavin Mogan by 29–28
5. Justin Harringa  loses to Mark Waite by 51–11, loses to Ewelina Wilkosz by 35–16
6. Steven Terrana  loses to Mark Waite by 47–16, loses to Justin Harringa by 20–19
7. Zhao Xiaojie (Rick)  loses to Mark Waite by 57–5, loses to Steven Terrana by 25–24
8. Frederic Gurr  loses to Mark Waite by 52–10, loses to Zhao Xiaojie (Rick) by 25–24
9. Andrey Falko  loses to Mark Waite by 56–6, loses to Frederic Gurr by 26–13

Although Mark Waite came first in the voting results,
being on the board would violate the link:/project/board-election-process/#corporate-involvement[Corporate Involvement clause] which states that
"the number of board members affiliated with one company must be less than 50%".
Mark will continue to be link:/project/team-leads/#documentation[Documentation officer].
Regardless of his official role, Mark has been leading many initiatives and helping a lot with various aspects of the community governance.

Congratulations to Marky and Gavin, and thanks to all candidates!
All new board members are elected for a 2-year term unless they decide to step down earlier.
The estimated end of the term for them is December 02, 2022.
We would also like to thank link:https://github.com/slide[Alex Earl] and link:https://github.com/rtyler[R. Tyler Croy] who step down from the Jenkins Governance Board this year.
Thanks to them for all contributions and for continued community leadership.

Statement from Marky Jackson:

It is a tremendous honor to be elected to this roles. I am so humbled.
Being part of this community is a fantastic opportunity that I have had. It has given me so many joys. Whether helping to foster community collaboration, working on the roadmap, leading various SIG’s or helping meetups or conferences, this community has given me so much.
My goals are bridging the Jenkins project with other interoperability projects, defining the roadmap, achieving roadmap goals, continuing to help meetups thrive, and our conferences focus on the community. I want to ensure we are transparent in our goals and how we achieved them. I want to continue to build up a welcoming community that holds diversity and inclusion at the forefront.
I look forward to working with the other members of the Governance Board to continue to deliver on the incredible things this project is known for.

Statement from Gavin Mogan:

Gavin here. I'm still in shock that I got voted in for the Jenkins board.
It felt like yesterday I just got started helping people randomly on IRC. This is truly exciting.
I plan to continue to help out as much as I can wherever I can, just in a bit more official capacity.
This is truly exciting. I have no firm plans or agenda, just keep pushing advocacy and getting people to help each other in a positive and safe way.
My specialities lie in outside of Jenkins core, whether it be working on the plugin site, or hanging out on IRC, Gitter and Reddit helping out where I can.

== Officer election details

All 5 officer positions were up for election this year.
These roles have a 1-year term, with the estimated end of term on Dec 02, 2021.
After the initial review of nominations and confirmations with potential candidates,
4 officer positions were uncontested:

* **Olivier Vernin** - link:/project/team-leads/#infrastructure[Infrastructure officer].
* **Marky Jackson** - link:/project/team-leads/#events[Events officer].
  Marky inherits this role from link:https://github.com/alyssat[Alyssa Tong]
  who decided to step down from the officer role and to focus on the Jenkins community marketing,
  including https://stories.jenkins.io/[Jenkins Is The Way] and many other initiatives started by Alyssa.
* **Mark Waite** - link:/project/team-leads/#documentation[Documentation officer].
* **Daniel Beck** - link:/project/team-leads/#security[Security officer].

Thanks to all Jenkins officers for their continued leadership!
Officers take responsibility for many day-to-day processes in the Jenkins community and lead the contributor teams working on them.
It requires significant time commitment, and it is not taken for granted.

Release Officer election results::
link:https://github.com/timja[Tim Jacomb] won the biggest support as a Release officer (link:https://civs.cs.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/results.pl?id=E_287cb63d82ce7972[voting results]).
Tim will replace in this role link:https://github.com/olivergondza[Oliver Gondža]
who has been leading the Release Team and the release processes since 2016 when the role was officially introduced.

1. **Tim Jacomb**  (Condorcet winner: wins contests with all other choices)
2. Baptiste Mathus  loses to Tim Jacomb by 40–23
3. Victor Martinez  loses to Tim Jacomb by 38–25, loses to Baptiste Mathus by 32–31

Here is a statement from Tim Jacomb: 

[quote, "Tim Jacomb, Jenkins Release Officer"]
____
I'm excited for the year ahead, let's see where we can take the Jenkins release area in the future.
As a Release Officer I would like to increase automation, ease onboarding of new contributors to the release team,
and ensure that responsibilities rotate among people so that I wouldn’t be a bottleneck for any task.
____

Thanks to link:https://github.com/alyssat[Alyssa Tong] and link:https://github.com/olivergondza[Oliver Gondža] for their long-time service as Jenkins officers!
We are looking to continue working with them in the Jenkins community.
And congratulations to Tim Jacomb and Marky Jackson for joining the team!

=== Statistics

This year we had 92 registered voters and around 65 actual votes.
It is significantly lower than in the link:/blog/2019/12/16/board-election-results/[2019 elections] when we had almost 350 voters.
It can be partially explained by the change of the communication process.
This year we decided to not use the previous link:/blog/2019/11/08/board-elections/[voter registration system],
and we relied on the user and developer mailing lists instead of sending messages to the entire LDAP user database.
This is definitely something we need to review at the retrospective.

=== What's next for the board?

The last year was awesome for the Jenkins project governance.
With help of many contributors and with the renewed board,
we have been able to facilitate many initiatives in the Jenkins project,
for example hosting contributor summits,
publishing the link:/project/roadmap/[public roadmap],
link:/project/conduct/[Code of Conduct update],
link:https://cd.foundation/blog/2020/08/25/jenkins-terminology-changes/[terminology changes],
and link:/blog/2020/08/04/cdf-graduation/[graduation in the Continuous Delivery Foundation].
There is a lot more work to do to grow the community and to ensure the long term sustainability of the project.

In short term, our key priority is to organize knowledge and permission transfers to the new board members and officers so that they can be effective in their new roles.
The board will also focus on maintaining the Jenkins governance processes
(meetings, budget approvals, funding, etc.) and defining the next steps and priorities.

There are many longer-term initiatives the board could facilitate:
long-anticipated features and architecture changes,
changing the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep[Jenkins Enhancement Proposal] process,
creating better communication channels with Jenkins users,
and onboarding of new contributors and maintainers.
Such initiatives are instrumental for the evolution of the Jenkins project.
The ideas will be discussed in link:/mailing-lists/[mailing lists] and during governance meetings.
If you would like to share your vision and ideas about what's needed in the project,
it is definitely a great time to contribute!
