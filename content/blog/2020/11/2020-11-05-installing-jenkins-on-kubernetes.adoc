We are super excited to announce that the link:/sigs/docs/gsod/2020/projects/document-jenkins-on-kubernetes/[Document Jenkins on Kubernetes Project] recently merged its first PR into Jenkins.io.
This link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/pull/3822[PR] adds a new link:/doc/book/installing/kubernetes/[Kubernetes] section to the existing link:/doc/book/installing/[Installing Jenkins] chapter of Jenkins.io.

image:/images/post-images/2020/2020-10-30-installing-jenkins-on-kubernetes/installing-jenkins-on-kubernetes-section.png[Installing Jenkins on Kubernetes Section]

This new section describes two options to install/run Jenkins on Kubernetes, link:/doc/book/installing/kubernetes/#create-a-minikube-cluster[how to setup a minikube cluster] on which to run your Jenkins deployment and finally a bonus segment that explains some link:/doc/book/installing/kubernetes/#setup-wizard[Post-installation setups] such as link:/doc/book/installing/kubernetes/#unlocking-jenkins[unlocking Jenkins], link:/doc/book/installing/kubernetes/#customizing-jenkins-with-plugins[customizing Jenkins with plugins] and link:/doc/book/installing/kubernetes/#creating-the-first-administrator-user[creating your first administrator user].

The first installation option covered in this section is link:/doc/book/installing/kubernetes/#install-jenkins-with-helm-v3[helm] a package manager for Kubernetes whose package format is called a chart. The link:/doc/book/installing/kubernetes/#install-jenkins-with-helm-v3[helm section] covers the prerequisites for installing Jenkins on Kubernetes using Helm, installing and configuring helm, creating a persistent volume and service account, and finally, Installing Jenkins.

The second option describes how to link:/doc/book/installing/kubernetes/#install-jenkins-with-yaml-files[install Jenkins using a set of yaml files]. 
This section explains how to link:/doc/book/installing/kubernetes/#create-jenkins-deployment-file[create a Jenkins deployment file], link:/doc/book/installing/kubernetes/#deploy-jenkins[Deploy Jenkins], grant access to jenkins service, and finally link:/doc/book/installing/kubernetes/#access-jenkins-dashboard[access your Jenkins dashboard after installation].

== Splitting the Installing Jenkins Chapter

The addition of the Kubernetes section highlighted a long-standing challenge with the link:/doc/book/installing/[Installing Jenkins] chapter.
It was too long and contained too many topics, making it difficult and unpleasant for
most users to navigate.
To top the icing on the cake and further improve the experience on Jenkins documentation users, another link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/pull/3874[PR] was merged into Jenkins.io to split the Installing Jenkins chapter into smaller chapters for better separation of concerns and easy navigation. This PR also redirects bookmarks that linked to the previous locations like link:/doc/book/installing/#debianubuntu["Installing Jenkins on Debian and Ubuntu"] using Javascript.

The image above is a snapshot of what the link:/doc/book/installing/[Installing Jenkins] chapter looked like before the PR.
All sections of this chapter such as **docker, Kubernetes and others** were lumped up on the same page making it too long with so much information thereby making it difficult to navigate or even find information on this page.

This snapshot shows what the Installing Jenkins chapter looks like after the PR.
With this chapter split into smaller sections, it’s neater, clearer and most importantly easier to navigate to the section of interest without having to scroll through so much information that’s not necessarily needed.
