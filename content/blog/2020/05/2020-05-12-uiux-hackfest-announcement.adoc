On behalf of the Jenkins _User Experience_, _Documentation_ and _Advocacy and Outreach_ special interest groups,
we are happy to announce the link:/events/online-hackfest/2020-uiux/[online UI/UX hackfest] on May 25-29!
Everyone is welcome to participate, regardless of their Jenkins development experience.

The goal is to get together and work on improving Jenkins user experience,
including but not limited to user interface and user documentation.
We also invite you to share experiences about Jenkins and to participate in UX testing.
The event follows the link:/blog/2020/04/30/jenkins-is-the-way/[Jenkins is the Way] theme and the
most active contributors will get special edition swag and prizes!

== Event plan

This hackfest is NOT a _hackathon_.
We do not expect participants to dedicate all their time during the event timeframe, but hop-in/hop-out as their time allows.
Everybody can spend as much time as they are willing to dedicate.
Spending a few days or just a few hours is fine, any contributions matter regardless of their size.
Jenkins development experience is not required,
we have newcomer-friendly stories for those who want to start contributing to the project.
We will also have a 24/7 link:https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#jenkinsci_hackfest:gitter.im[jenkinsci/hackfest] Gitter chat for Q&A and coordination between contributors.

There will be link:/events/online-hackfest/2020-uiux/#tracks-and-project-ideas[3 main tracks]:

* **User Interface** -
  Improve look&feel and accessibility for Jenkins users,
  work on new read-only interface for instances managed with configuration as code,
  create and update Jenkins themes,
  and many other topics.
  This track is coordinated by the link:/sigs/ux/[UX SIG].
* **User Documentation** -
  Improve and create new link:/doc/book/[user documentation], link:/doc/tutorials/[tutorials] and link:/solutions/[solution pages].
  Also, there is ongoing documentation migration from Wiki to jenkins.io and plugin repositories.
  This track is coordinated by the link:/sigs/docs/[Documentation SIG].
* **Spread the word** -
  Write user stories for link:https://stories.jenkins.io/[Jenkins Is The Way] site and the link:/blog[Jenkins blog],
  post about your Jenkins user experience and new features,
  record overview and HOWTO videos, etc.
  This track is coordinated by the link:/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/[Advocacy and Outreach SIG].

We are working on publishing project ideas and issues for the listed tracks.
The current list can be found on the link:/events/online-hackfest/2020-uiux/#tracks-and-project-ideas[UI / UX hackfest event page],
this list will be finalized by the beginning of the hackfest.
You are welcome to propose your own projects within the User Experience theme.

During the event, we will organize link:https://www.meetup.com/Jenkins-online-meetup/[online meetups] and ad-hoc training sessions in different timezones.
All these sessions will be recorded and shared on our link:https://www.youtube.com/user/jenkinsci/playlists[YouTube channel].
There are no mandatory sessions you must attend, you are welcome to join ones remotely or watch the recordings.
After the event we will invite participants to demo their projects at online meetings or recorded sessions.
