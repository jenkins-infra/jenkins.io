==== Configuration-as-code plugin
The link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/configuration-as-code[Configuration as Code plugin] has been designed as an opinionated way to configure Jenkins based on human-readable declarative configuration files. Writing such a file should be feasible without being a Jenkins expert, just translating into code a configuration process one is used to executing in the web UI. The plugin uses a schema to verify the files being applied to the Jenkins instance.

With the new JSON Schema being enabled developers can now test their yaml file against it. The schema checks the `descriptors` i.e. configuration that can be applied to a plugin or Jenkins core, the correct type is used and help text is provided in some cases. VSCode allows us to test out the schema right out of the box with some modifications. This project was built as part of the link:https://communitybridge.org/[Community Bridge] initiative which is a platform created by the Linux Foundation to empower developers — and the individuals and companies who support them — to advance sustainability, security, and diversity in open source technology. 

=== Steps to Enable the Schema Validation

a) The first step includes installing the link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jcasc-developers.jcasc-plugin[JCasC-Plugin] and opening up the extension via the extention list. Shortcut for opening the extension list in VSCode editor using `Ctrl + Shift + X`.

b) The next step would be  inserting the JSON Schema inside the VSCode workspace. We would be including the schema in the current directory.

c) Spin up your Jenkins server and navigate to `/configuration-as-code/jsonSchema`. 

d) Copy and paste this schema into a new file called `json.schema`.

e) In order to enable validation we need to include it in the workspace settings.
Navigate to `File` and then `Preference` and then `Settings`. Inside settings search for `json` and inside `settings.json` include the following configuration.

[source, json]
----
{
"yaml.schemas": {
        "schema.json": "y[a]?ml"
    }
}
----

You can specify a glob pattern as the value for schema.json which is the file name for the schema. This would apply the schema to all yaml files. eg: `.[y[a]?ml]`

g) The following tasks can be done using VSCode:

  a) Auto completion (Ctrl + Space):
    Auto completes on all commands.

  b) Document Outlining (Ctrl + Shift + O):
  Provides the document outlining of all completed nodes in the file.

h) Create a new file under the work directory called `jenkins.yml`. For example consider the following contents for the file:

[source, yaml]
----
jenkins:
  systemMessage: “Hello World”
  numExecutors: 2
----

i) The above yaml file is valid according to the schema and vscode should provide you with validation and autocompletion for the same.
