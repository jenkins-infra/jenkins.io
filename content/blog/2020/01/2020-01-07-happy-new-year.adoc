## Some stats and numbers

If this section seems to be too long for you, here is some infographic prepared by link:https://github.com/tracymiranda[Tracy Miranda].
As you may see, Jenkins is pretty big :)

image:/images/post-images/2020/01-new-year-blogpost/jenkins_stats_2019.png[Jenkins 2019 in numbers, role=center, float=center,height=512]

**Community**.
Over the past year we had **5433** contributors in GitHub repositories (committers, reviewers, issue submitters, etc.).
We had **1892** unique committers who created **7122** pull requests and **45484** commits, bots excluded.
Contributors represent **273** companies and **111** countries, 8% of contributors are recognized as independent.
The most active repositories were Jenkins Core and jenkins.io.
The most active month was October 2019 when we reached the record high number of contributions: **915** unique contributors, **124** of them were first-timers, thanks to link:/events/hacktoberfest/[Hacktoberfest]!.

**Jenkins core**.
In 2019 Jenkins core had **54** weekly and **13** LTS releases with several hundreds of notable fixes/enhancements.
There was a login screen extensibility rework, many update manager and administrative monitors improvements.
We also introduced support for user timezones, not speaking of emojis support ðŸ¥³.
There was also a lot of housekeeping work: better APIs, codebase refresh, cleaning up static analysis warnings and removing deprecated features like Remoting CLI.
The core's components also got major updates.
Only link:/projects/remoting/[Jenkins Remoting] got **11** releases with stability improvements and new features like support of inbound connections to headless Jenkins controllers.
There are also major incoming features like jep:222[WebSocket Services support], UI look&feel updates, jira:JENKINS-12548[Readonly system configuration support], Docker images for new platforms like Arm.
To facilitate further changes we created a new link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/jenkinsci-dev/0sdrcSOQW64/tD-IKDTsBQAJ[Core pull request reviewers team] and added **9** contributors there.

**Plugins**.
There were **2654** plugin releases, and **157** NEW plugins have been hosted in the Update Center.
Jenkins ecosystem got a lot of new integrations with Development and DevOps tools.
Also, warm welcome back to the plugin:scriptler[Scriptler Plugin] which was depublished in 2017 due to security issues.
If you are afraid about such plugin numbers and dependency management, there is a new link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool[Plugin Installation Manager CLI Tool] which should help Jenkins users to manage plugins more efficiently.

**Security**.
It was a hot year for the link:/security/[Jenkins Security Team].
There were **5** link:/security/advisories/[security advisories] for the core and *20* - for plugins.
In total we disclosed **288** vulnerabilities across the project, including some backlog cleaning for unmaintained plugins.
plugin:script-security[Script Security Plugin] was the hottest plugin with **10** critical fixes addressing various sandbox bypass vulnerabilities.
Plain text storage and unprotected credentials were the most popular vulnerability type **120** disclosures in 2019.
It was made possible by hundreds of reports submitted by contributors after code surveys,
special thanks to link:https://github.com/woodspeed[Viktor Gazdag] who reported the most of the issues and became the Jenkins 2019 Security MVP (check out his story link:/blog/2019/11/29/do-plugins-store-credentials-in-a-secure-way/[here]).

**Infrastructure**.
Got Jenkins? If so, you rely on Jenkins update centers, website and issue tracker.
All these and many other services are maintained by the link:/projects/infrastructure/[Jenkins Infrastructure Team].
This year the team handled **more than 400** requests in the bugtracker, and many other informal requests.
In total, more than **30** people contributed to Jenkins infrastructure this year (website content is excluded).
We also deployed **4** new services, migrated **7** services from Azure Container Service to Azure Kubernetes Service and updated many other services.
More changes will happen in the next months, and we are looking for link:/projects/infrastructure/#team[new INFRA team members]!

**Documentation**.
Only last quarter we had **178** contributors to Jenkins documentation. It includes jenkins.io and other documentation hosted on GitHub, Wiki is not included.
There is also ongoing migration plugin documentation from Jenkins Wiki to GitHub (link:link:/blog/2019/10/21/plugin-docs-on-github/[announcement]). 
Since the beginning of the project in Sep 2019, more than **150** plugin were migrated, and they got significant documentation revamp during the migration.
You can see the current status link:https://jenkins-wiki-exporter.jenkins.io/progress[here].
We also work on introducing changelog automation in the project.
**123** plugins have already adopted the new link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/.github/blob/master/.github/release-drafter.adoc[changelog tools], powered by Release Drafter.
Also, we had more than **60** technical link:/blog[blog posts] published on jenkins.io.

**Configuration as Code** was one of the most popular areas this year.
plugin:configuration-as-code[Jenkins Configuration as Code Plugin] had more than **30** releases with new features and bug fixes.
More than **50** plugins have been also updated in order to offer better configuration-as-code support.
As a result, the JCasC Plugin got massive adoption this year (from **2000** to almost **8000** installations),
and now it becomes a de-facto standard for managing Jenkins as code.
This year we also ran our very first link:https://communitybridge.org/[CommunityBridge] project devoted to link:/projects/jcasc/dev-tools/[JCasC Schema validation and developer tools].

**Events and outreach programs**.
In 2019 we participated in multiple conferences, including FOSDEM, DevOps World | Jenkins World, SCALE.
More than **40** Jenkins Area Meetups were organized across the world, and there were many other meetups devoted to Jenkins.
We also kept expanding our link:/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/outreach-programs/[outreach programs].
In total we had **12** students who participated in link:/projects/gsoc/2019/[Google Summer of Code], link:/blog/2019/09/23/outreachy-audit-log-release/[Outreachy] and newly introduced link:/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/outreach-programs/#community-bridge[Community Bridge].
We also had the biggest ever link:/events/hacktoberfest/[Hacktoberfest] with **664** pull requests and **102** participants.
These outreach programs help us to deliver new features in Jenkins.
For example, this year we added plugin:github-branch-sourcep[Multi-branch Pipeline support for Gitlab] and a new link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool[Plugin Installation Manager Tool] during GSoC, 
and Outreachy resulted in a new link:/blog/2019/09/23/outreachy-audit-log-release/[Audit Log Plugin].

Where did we get those stats?
GitHub stats came from the link:https://devstats.cd.foundation/[CDF DevStats] service.
These stats include all repositories in the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci[jenkinsci organization] and most popular repositories in link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra[jenkins-infra], Jenkins X and other organizations/repositories within the project are not included.
Other stats came from link:https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTeUXM75UR8m_v5FbldYYNXeVW0CtXkpRydMRvQjBuew2vRyC4cjgLMSUEVNoonfYbKDSbOvasHPpxg[project reports], component changelogs, link:https://stats.jenkins.io/[Jenkins usage statistics service], link:https://updates.jenkins.io/current/release-history.json[plugin releases history].

## What's next?

Year 2020 will be pretty busy for the Jenkins project.
There are many long-overdue changes in the project, which need to happen if we want the project to succeed.
As it was written link:/blog/2019/12/16/board-election-results/#whats-next-for-the-board[Board elections blogpost],
there are many areas to consider: UX revamp, cloud native Jenkins, pluggable storage, etc.
In the coming months there will be a lot of discussions in link:/mailing-lists/[mailing lists] and link:/sigs/[special interest groups],
and we invite all teams to work on their roadmaps and to communicate them in the community.

Next month we will participate in link:https://fosdem.org/2020/[FOSDEM], and there will be a Jenkins stand there.
On January 31st we will also host a traditional link:https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/267684785/[contributor summit in Brussels],
where we will talk about next steps for the project, in terms of technical roadmaps and the project governance.
If you are interested in Jenkins, stop by at our community booths and join us at the summit!
See link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/PUgV5xxHMwgp[this thread] for more information.

We also plan to continue all outreach programs.
At the moment we are looking for Google Summer of Code 2020 mentors and project ideas (link:/blog/2019/12/20/call-for-mentors/[announcement]),
and we will be also interested to consider non-coding projects as a part of other programs like CommunityBridge.
We also work on improving link:/participate/[contribution guidelines] for newcomers and expert contributors.
If you are interested, please contact the link:/sigs/advocacy-and-outreach/[Advocacy and Outreach SIG].

## And even more

This blog post does not provide a full overview of what changed in the project.
The Jenkins project consists of more than 2000 plugins and components which are developed by thousands of contributors.
Thanks to them, a lot of changes happen in the project every day.
We are cordially grateful to everybody who participates in the project, regardless of contribution size.
Everything matters: new features, bug fixes, documentation, blog posts, well reported issues, Stackoverflow responses, etc.
THANKS A LOT FOR ALL YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS!

So, keep updating Jenkins and exploring new features.
And stay tuned, there is much more to come next year!
