Nominations are open for two link:/project/board[governance board] and for all five link:/project/team-leads/[officer] positions,
namely: Security, Events, Release, Infrastructure, and Documentation.
The board positions and officer roles are an essential part of Jenkins' community governance and well-being. 
We invite Jenkins contributors and community members to sign-up for elections and to nominate contributors for the elected roles.

These are the second elections held by the Jenkins project.
During the 2019 elections, we elected 3 board members and 5 officers.

This year, we decided to make a few changes in the link:/project/board-election-process[election process] based on the 2019 elections feedback.
