This blog post is about our phase 3 progress on link:/projects/gsoc/2020/projects/github-checks/[GitHub Checks API Project], you can find our previous blog posts for link:/blog/2020/07/09/github-checks-api-plugin-coding-phase-1[phase 1] and link:/blog/2020/08/03/github-checks-api-plugin-coding-phase-2[phase 2].

At the end of this summer, the GSoC journey for link:/projects/gsoc/2020/projects/github-checks/[GitHub Checks API Project] comes to an end as well.
In this blog post, I'll show you our works during the last month:

- Pipeline Support
- Rerun Request Support
- Git SCM Support
- Documentation

_All the above features will be available in our planned 1.0.0 version of plugin:checks-api[Checks API Plugin] and plugin:github-checks[GitHub Checks Plugin]._

=== Pipeline Support

The pipeline support allows users to directly publish checks in their pipeline script without depending on any other consumers.

The check in the above screenshot is published by script:

[source, groovy]
----
publishChecks name: 'pipeline check', title: 'pipeline ', summary: '# A pipeline check example',
        text: "## This check is published through the pipeline script",
        detailsURL: 'https://ci.jenkins.io'
----

_If you want to publish checks to GitHub, please install the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/github-checks-plugin[GitHub implementation] and refer to the link:https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/checks[GitHub API documentation] for the requirements for each field. A default value (build link) for `detailsURL` will be provided automatically._

This feature can be useful when many stages exist in your pipeline script and each takes a long time: you can publish a check for each stage to keep track of the build.

=== Rerun Request Support

The rerun request allows GitHub users to rerun the failed builds. When a build failed (which leads to a failed check), a `Re-run` button will be added automatically by GitHub.

By clicking the `Re-run` button, Jenkins will reschedule a build for the last commit of this branch.

_Since all checks of a commit are produced by a single build, you don't have to rerun all failed checks, just rerun any one of the failed check will refresh all checks._

=== Git SCM Support

Thanks to link:https://github.com/uhafner[Ullrich]'s great help, the plugin:github-checks[GitHub Checks Plugin] now supports link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-plugin[Git SCM].
This means now you can publish checks for your freestyle project or any other projects that use Git SCM.

=== Document

link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/checks-api-plugin/blob/master/docs/consumers-guide.md[Consumers Guide] and link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/checks-api-plugin/blob/master/docs/implementation-guide.md[Implementation Guide] are now available.
As a Jenkins developer, you can now start consuming our API or even providing an implementation for other SCM platforms beside GitHub.

=== Acknowledgment

The whole link:/projects/gsoc/2020/projects/github-checks/[GitHub Checks API project] is started as a Google Summer of Code project. Much appreciate my mentors (link:https://github.com/timja[Tim] and link:https://github.com/uhafner[Ullrich]) for their great help during the whole summer. Also huge thanks to the link:/sigs/gsoc/[Jenkins GSoC SIG] and the whole community for the technique support and resources.
