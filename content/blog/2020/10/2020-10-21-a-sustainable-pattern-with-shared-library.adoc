This post will describe how I use a link:/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/[shared library] in Jenkins. Typically when using multibranch pipeline.

If possible (if not forced to) I implement the pipelines without multibranch. I previously wrote about how I do that with my link:/blog/2019/12/14/generic-webhook-trigger-plugin/[Generic Webhook Trigger Plugin in a previous post]. But this will be my second choice, If I am not allowed to remove the `Jenkinsfile`:s from the repositories entirely.

== Context ==

Within an organization, you typically have a few different kinds of repositories. Each repository versioning one application. You may use different techniques for different kinds of applications. The link:https://github.com/jenkinsci[Jenkins organization on GitHub] is an example with 2300 repositories.

== The Problems ==

Large **Jenkinsfiles in every repository containing duplicated code**. It seems common that the `Jenkinsfile`:s in every repository contains much more than just the things that are unique for that repository. The link:/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/[shared libraries] feature may not be used, or it is used but not with an optimal pattern.

**Installation specific Jenkinsfile:s** that only work with one specific Jenkins installation. Sometimes I see multiple `Jenkinsfile`:s, one for each purpose or Jenkins installation. 

**No documentation** and/or no natural place to write documentation.

**Development is slow**. Adding new features to repositories is a time consuming task. I want to be able to push features to 1000+ repositories without having to update their `Jenkinsfile`:s.

**No flexible way of doing feature toggling**. When maintaining a large number of repositories it is sometimes nice to introduce a feature to a subset of those repositories. If that works well, the feature is introduced to all repositories.

== The Solution ==

My solution is a pattern that is inspired by how the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci[Jenkins organization on GitHub] does it with its link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/pipeline-library/blob/master/vars/buildPlugin.groovy[buildPlugin()]. But it is not exactly the same.

=== Shared Library ===

Here is how I organize my link:/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/[shared libraries].

==== Jenkinsfile ====

I put this in the `Jenkinsfile`:s:

```groovy
buildRepo()
```

==== Default Configuration ====

I provide a default configuration that any repository will get, if no other configuration is given in `buildRepo()`.

I create a `vars/getConfig.groovy` with:

```groovy
def call(givenConfig = [:]) {
  def defaultConfig = [
    /**
      * The Jenkins node, or label, that will be allocated for this build.
      */
    "jenkinsNode": "BUILD",
    /**
      * All config specific to NPM repo type.
      */
    "npm": [
      /**
        * Whether or not to run Cypress tests, if there are any.
        */
      "cypress": true
    ],
    "maven": [
      /**
        * Whether or not to run integration tests, if there are any.
        */
      "integTest": true
    ]
  ]
  // https://e.printstacktrace.blog/how-to-merge-two-maps-in-groovy/
  def effectiveConfig merge(defaultConfig, givenConfig)
  println "Configuration is documented here: https://whereverYouHos/getConfig.groovy"
  println "Default config: " + defaultConfig
  println "Given config: " + givenConfig
  println "Effective config: " + effectiveConfig
  return effectiveConfig
}
```

==== Build Plan ====

I construct a build plan as early as possible. Taking decisions on what will be done in this build. So that the rest of the code becomes more streamlined.

I try to rely as much as possible on conventions. I may provide configuration that lets users turn off features, but they are otherwise turned on if they are detected.

I create a `vars/getBuildPlan.groovy` with:

```groovy
def call(effectiveConfig = [:]) {
  def derivedBuildPlan = [
    "repoType": "NOT DETECTED"
    "npm": [],
    "maven": []
  ]

  node {
    deleteDir()
    checkout([$class: 'GitSCM', 
      branches: [[name: '*/branchName']],
      extensions: [
          [$class: 'SparseCheckoutPaths',
            sparseCheckoutPaths:
            [[$class:'SparseCheckoutPath', path:'package.json,pom.xml']]
          ]
      ],
      userRemoteConfigs: [[credentialsId: 'someID',
      url: 'git@link.git']]
    ])

    if (fileExists('package.json')) {
      def packageJSON = readJSON file: 'package.json'
      derivedBuildPlan.repoType = "NPM"
      derivedBuildPlan.npm.cypress = effectiveConfig.npm.cypress && packageJSON.devDependencies.cypress
      derivedBuildPlan.npm.eslint = packageJSON.devDependencies.eslint
      derivedBuildPlan.npm.tslint = packageJSON.devDependencies.tslint
    } else if (fileExists('pom.xml')) {
      derivedBuildPlan.repoType = "MAVEN"
      derivedBuildPlan.maven.integTest = effectiveConfig.maven.integTest && fileExists('src/integtest')
    } else {
      throw RuntimeException('Unable to detect repoType')
    }

    println "Build plan: " + derivedBuildPlan
    deleteDir()
  }
  return derivedBuildPlan
}
```

==== Public API ====

This is the public API, this is what I want the users of this library to actually invoke.

I implement a `buildRepo()` method that will use that default configuration. It can also be called with a subset of the default configuration to tweak it.

I create a `vars/buildRepo.groovy` with:

```groovy
def call(givenConfig = [:]) {
  def effectiveConfig = getConfig(givenConfig)
  def buildPlan = getBuildPlan(effectiveConfig)
  
  if (effectiveConfig.repoType == 'MAVEN')
    buildRepoMaven(buildPlan);
  } else if (effectiveConfig.repoType == 'NPM')
    buildRepoNpm(buildPlan);
  }
}
```

A user can get all the default behavior with:

```groovy
buildRepo()
```

A user can also choose not to run Cypress, even if it exists in the repository:

```groovy
buildRepo([
  "npm": [
    "cypress": false
  ]
])
```

==== Supporting Methods ====

This is usually much more complex, but I put some code here just to have a complete implementation.

I create a `vars/buildRepoNpm.groovy` with:

```groovy
def call(buildPlan = [:]) {
  node(buildPlan.jenkinsNode) {
    stage("Install") {
      sh "npm install"
    }
    stage("Build") {
      sh "npm run build"
    }
    if (buildPlan.npm.tslint) {
      stage("TSlint") {
        sh "npm run tslint"
      }
    }
    if (buildPlan.npm.eslint) {
      stage("ESlint") {
        sh "npm run eslint"
      }
    }
    if (buildPlan.npm.cypress) {
      stage("Cypress") {
        sh "npm run e2e:cypress"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

I create a `vars/buildRepoMaven.groovy` with:

```groovy
def call(buildPlan = [:]) {
  node(buildPlan.jenkinsNode) {
    if (buildPlan.maven.integTest) {
      stage("Verify") {
        sh "mvn verify"
      }
    } else {
      stage("Package") {
        sh "mvn package"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

=== Duplication ===

The `Jenkinsfile`:s are kept extremely small. It is only when they, for some reason, diverge from the default config that they need to be changed.

=== Documentation ===

There is one single point where documentation is written, the `getConfig.groovy`-file. It can be referred to whenever someone asks for documentation.

=== Scalability ===

This is a highly scalable pattern. Both with regards to performance and maintainability in code.

It scales in performance because the `Jenkinsfile`:s can be used by any Jenkins installation. So that you can scale by adding several completely separate Jenkins installations, not only nodes.

It scales in code because it adds just a tiny `Jenkinsfile` to repositories. It relies on conventions instead, like the existence of attributes in `package.json` and location of integration tests in `src/integtest`.

=== Installation Agnostic ===

The `Jenkinsfile`:s does not point at any implementation of this API. It just invokes it and it is up to the Jenkins installation to implement it, with a link:/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/[shared libraries].

It can even be used by something that is not Jenkins. Perhaps you decide to do something in a Docker container, you can still parse the `Jenkinsfile` with Groovy or (with some magic) with any language.

=== Feature Toggling ===

The link:/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/[shared library] can do feature toggling by:

 * Letting some feature be enabled by default for every repository with name starting with `x`.
 * Or, adding some default config saying `"feature-x-enabled": false`, while some repos change their `Jenkinsfile`:s to `buildRepo(["feature-x-enabled": true])`.

Whenever the feature feels stable, it can be enabled for everyone by changing only the link:/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/[shared library].
