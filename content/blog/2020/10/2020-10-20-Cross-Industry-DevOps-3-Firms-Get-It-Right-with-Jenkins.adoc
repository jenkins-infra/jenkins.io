description: "3 inspiring Jenkins stories highlighting how organizations implement Jenkins in the work place"
---

Some months ago, we took a significant step in helping the Jenkins community share their stories of how they improved workflows, sped up testing, and saw better quality results after implementing Jenkins into their software development processes.

By the end of the year, we’ll have link:https://jenkinsistheway.io/user-stories/[over 50 Jenkins user stories published] with many more in the pipeline. We invite you to explore them all but wanted to share three inspiring examples highlighting how various organizations approach — and implement — Jenkins in the workplace. Enjoy!

== Story 1: Jenkins is the way to tackle any challenge

=== Enterprise-wide CI/CD solution caters to the complex problems that project teams face each day, as told by Jenkins user Mark Baumann:

_“Our development teams work in a wide range of projects and domains. We have a very diverse tooling landscape since the projects work with all kinds of different software tools. Of course, projects in the embedded domain will have different toolsets than those working in the automotive domain._

_Each project team created its own CI Toolchain, which caused a lot of work for the developers and the IT department. Each project needed to set up their own virtual machine, install and manage their own CI Server, Version Management, and whatever they needed. Creating such a toolchain could easily take up weeks until it was running because there was no standard solution and each team had to start from scratch.”_

Discover how ITK-Engineering GmbH developed a company-wide, common, internal CI/CD toolchain and increased the number of builds for each project and how nearly all departments are now practicing CI/CD. link:https://jenkinsistheway.io/user-story/to-tackle-any-challenge/[The full Jenkins / ITK Engineering story is here!]

== Story 2: Jenkins is the way to add spicy flavors to agency processes

=== A creative agency start-up simplifies the build, test, and deploy steps, allowing the small team to focus more on the deliverables and less on the process. As told by Jenkins user Erik Woitschig:

_“It was quite a challenge to streamline and combine all the services to build an artifact to deploy. Because of our micro service-oriented and distributed architecture, the most challenging part of rethinking our build, test, and deploy process was to figure out how best to sync the deployment of all services. We also had to retest builds properly to go live or initiate a rollback._

_With Jenkins and some pipelines, it was relatively simple to create a local and distributed artifact of our application to quickly share and deploy across the team, locally and globally.”_

Because Jenkins is simple to install and easy to maintain, Muzkat has increased productivity far beyond that of a 3-person team. Read on to learn how this bootstrapped Berlin-based agency is making a go of it with Jenkins.  link:https://jenkinsistheway.io/user-story/to-add-spicy-flavors-to-muzkats-processes/[The full Jenkins / Muzkat story is here!]

== Story 3: Jenkins is the way to focus on your code

=== As demands for the Wright Medical’s services grew, they required an agile DevOps environment that would grow and scale along with the tech team, as told by Jenkins user Christophe Carpentier:

_“What was critical to our success was the stability of Jenkins and a significant number of reliable plugins! We could take a few plugins, set up our workflow, and add GitLab and SonarQube integration without ever stopping or losing data in over a year. We found that all of the problems we encountered were our own, and that is why it was critical to make Jenkins an essential part of our workflow._

_With this implementation, Jenkins allows more than would be manually possible. It flawlessly updates our staging environments, blocks commits based on the SonarQube analysis, and provides us with near-instant feedback on merge requests.”_

Learn how Wright Medical supports a growing dev team by switching to an agile DevOps process that allows for automatic daily releases — versus weekly manual builds. Best of all, it’s letting the developers focus on building great code rather than infrastructure. link:https://jenkinsistheway.io/user-story/to-focus-on-your-code/[The full Jenkins / Wright Medical story is here!]

=== What are you building?

Hope you enjoy these Jenkins user stories. You’ll find that “Jenkins Is The Way” website is a global showcase of how developers and engineers build, deploy, and automate great stuff with Jenkins. If you want to link:https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/JenkinsIsTheWay[share your story], we’ll send you a free Jenkins Is The Way T-Shirt in return. Hope to hear from you soon!
