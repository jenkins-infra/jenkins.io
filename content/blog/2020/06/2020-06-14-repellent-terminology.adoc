We have to talk, a real conversation about the power of words, honest talk about hurtful words, and the energy they hold.

As a community, we cannot turn a blind eye to what is happening in the world. 
What transpired on May 25th, 2020, and witnessed around the world has forever changed me as a person. 
George Floyd was a human and did not deserve what happened. Many before him did not deserve what happened.

Injustice must be addressed in every action. It must be at the forefront of our minds. We must do better.

In 2016, the Jenkins community decided to start removing offensive terminology within the project. Offensive language was deprecated in Jenkins 2.0.
In 2017, the project began tracking areas for correction link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-42816[tracking areas for correction].
This year, a group of core contributors continued addressing this critical link:https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2020/05/06/docker-agent-image-renaming/[work]. 

The Advocacy & Outreach SIG met to discussed and prioritize the continued work. 
This week we took another step towards removing offensive terminology within the project by updating previous blog posts and link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/pull/3447[removing offensive terminology].
There is more link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/CLR55wMZwZ8[work to do].

I am sorry these hurtful words exist in our community. I am sorry for the hurt they have caused.

Sincerely,
Marky
