=== Read-only Jenkins Configuration



=== Dark Theme


=== Jenkins Configuration UI Accessibility

Jenkins Web UI accessibility was one of the suggested topics at the event.
We would like to make Jenkins usable by as many people as possible.
It includes multiple groups of users: people with disabilities, ones using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.
In general, all Jenkins users would benefit from better navigation and layouts.

At the hackfest the major focus was on migrating configuration pages from tables to divs.
This effort will make these pages more friendly on marrow and especially mobile screens.
It will also help users to navigate complex forms with multiple levels of nesting.
Here is an example of a job configuration page using the new layout:


Progress at the hackfest:

* User Experience testing.
  Thanks to the hackfest contributors, we discovered several compatibility issues in plugins.
  Some of them have been already fixes.

there were also many smaller patches in the Jenkins core and various plugins.
