In this article, I would like to share some highlights from the User Interface track of the 
link:/events/online-hackfest/2020-uiux/[Jenkins UI/UX Hackfest] we held on May 25..29.
This blog post has been slightly delayed by the infrastructure issues we had in the project,
but, as for improving the Jenkins UI, it is better late than never.

In total we had link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/ui-ux-hackfest-2020#contributors[54 contributors] during the hackfest.
23 of them have contributed to the user interface track as committers, testers and reviewers.
We would like to thank all the contributors!
Key highlights from the event:

* We delivered a preview of link:/blog/2020/05/25/read-only-jenkins-announcement/[Jenkins read-only configuration].
  During the hackfest we discovered and fixed many compatibility issues.
* We created a new link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/dark-theme-plugin[Dark Theme] for Jenkins.
  We also improved theming support in the core, and fixed compatibility in many plugins.
* We contributed to the Jenkins UI accessibility, including UX testing and fixing the reported issues.
  jira:JENKINS-62437[Configuration UI: Tables to divs migration] testing was the dominant story there.
* We worked on a New Script Security approvals management UI 

See the blog post below to know more about these and other user interface improvements.

=== Read-only Jenkins Configuration

link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/ui-ux-hackfest-2020/tree/master/presentations/05-system-read[presentation materials]

A read-only view of Jenkins configurations, jobs and agents is important to plugin:configuration-as-code[Jenkins Configuration-as-Code] users.
It would allow them to access configuration and diagnostics information about their Jenkins instances while having no opportunity to occasionally change it.
This story is a part of the link:/project/roadmap[Jenkins roadmap],
and it was featured as an area for contribution during the hackfest.

In the beginning of the hackfest, on May 25th, we have released a preview for Read-only Jenkins Configuration.
Read the announcement from Tim Jacomb link:/blog/2020/05/25/read-only-jenkins-announcement/[in this blogpost].
During the hackfest we kept testing the change and fixing compatibility in the Jenkins plugins.

We would appreciate feedback and testing from the Jenkins users! See the blogpost for the guidelines.

=== Dark Theme

Dark user interface themes are very popular among developers: in IDE, communication tools, etc.
And there is an interest to have one for Jenkins.
There were a few of implementations before the hackfest, most notably link:https://github.com/camalot/jenkins-dark-stylish[camalot/jenkins-dark-stylish] and a dark version of the link:https://github.com/TobiX/jenkins-neo2-theme[Neo2 Theme].
These themes were difficult to maintain, and finally they were either removed or abandoned. 
What if Jenkins had an official theme?

During the hackfest a group of contributors focused on creating a new link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/dark-theme-plugin[Dark Theme] for Jenkins.
This effort included:

* Patches to the Jenkins core which simplified development and maintenance of UI themes.
  Support for CSS variables was added, as well as PostCSS processing which helps to simplify browser compatibility.
* link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/dark-theme-plugin[Dark Theme] itself.
* UI Testing and compatibility fixes in the core and multiple Jenkins plugins.
* link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/dark-theme-plugin/tree/master/demo[Dark theme demo] with support for the development mode.

You can try out this theme starting from Jenkins 2.239.
It is also available as a plugin:dark-theme[plugin] from the Jenkins Update Center.

=== Jenkins Configuration UI Accessibility

Jenkins Web UI accessibility was one of the suggested topics at the event.
We would like to make Jenkins usable by as many people as possible.
It includes multiple groups of users: people with disabilities, ones using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.
In general, all Jenkins users would benefit from better navigation and layouts.

At the hackfest the major focus was on migrating configuration pages from tables to divs
(jira:JENKINS-62437[]).
This effort will make these pages more friendly on marrow and especially mobile screens.
It will also help users to navigate complex forms with multiple levels of nesting.
Here is an example of a job configuration page using the new layout:

Progress at the hackfest:

* User Experience testing.
  Thanks to the hackfest contributors, we discovered several compatibility issues in plugins.
* Bug fixes in several plugins
* A link:https://github.com/oleg-nenashev/jenkins-tables-to-divs-config-migration-testenv[Dockerized demo] which allows to evaluate the change with a set of pre-configured plugins.

We will keep working on this change in the coming weeks,
and we invite Jenkins users and Contributors to help us with testing the change!
Testing guidelines are available in the jira:JENKINS-62437[] ticket.

=== New Script Security approvals management UI

During the hackfest link:https://github.com/wadeck[Wadeck Follonier] redesigned the script approval interface in the plugin:script-security[Script Security Plugin].
The new UI allows to view the list of approved scripts, shows the last access timestamp, and allows managing the approvals individually.
Before that it was not possible to do it from the Web interface.

there were also many smaller patches in the Jenkins core and various plugins.
