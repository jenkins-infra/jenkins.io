== How-To Introduction

Jenkins is an open source automation server written in Java. It is used to continuously build and test software projects, enabling developers to set up a CI/CD environment.
This How-To Guide is dedicated to the first part of CI/CD - to Continuous Integration

== How-To Do Continuous Integration with Jenkins

Purpose of this overview is to show how to automate the process of
building, testing and deploying your java and python apps using Jenkins

Wait until entire pipeline will be completed. +
In case the color of the header will change to ``green'' you will know
that the pipeline completed successfully. You may also verify that your
app is ready for demo or deployment.
