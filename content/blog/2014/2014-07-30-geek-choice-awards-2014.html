RebelLabs started annual <a href="https://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/10-kick-ass-technologies-modern-developers-love/12/">Geek Choice Awards</a>, and Jenkins was one of the 10 winners. See <a href="https://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/10-kick-ass-technologies-modern-developers-love/6/">the page they talk about Jenkins</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
My favorite part is, to quote, "Jenkins has an almost laughably dominant position in the CI server segment", and "With 70% of the CI market on lockdown and showing an increasing rate of plugin development, Jenkins is undoubtably the most popular way to go with CI servers."<br/>
