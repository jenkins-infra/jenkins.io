Jesse and I will walk through the source code of https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin[the workflow plugin], highlights key abstractions and extension points, and discuss how they are put together.

If you are interested in developing or retrofitting plugins to work with workflows, I think you'll find this session interesting.

The event will be on https://plus.google.com/events/cojjhg4kkpffkbpakj723fdht9k[Google Hangout] tomorrow. The time of the day is the same as usual https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Workflow+walk-through&iso=20140829T11&p1=224&ah=1&sort=1[office hours].
