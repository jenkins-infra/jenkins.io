<p><br/>
Over the past three years, the Jenkins User Conference is held annually in the <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc2013/juc2013-palo-alto-abstracts.cb#FlorianLier">Bay Area</a> with a few events in different locations around the world. The Jenkins User Conference has established a reputation as a focal point for the Jenkins community to come together to share new ideas and best practices. Each year we have experienced the growth and expansion within the Jenkins community. This year we are taking this platform to other regions of the world, offering regional gatherings of Jenkins users and developers.<br/>
