I'll be visiting London in early September, and if possible I'd love to organize some get together of Jenkins users/devs. I wonder if anyone is interested in hosting the event?<br/>
<br/>

I think it just needs to fit 20 or so people, so all we need is a single conference room somewhere in London. If you think you might be able to help, please drop us a note at <a href="http://lists.jenkins-ci.org/pipermail/jenkins-events/">the events list</a>.
