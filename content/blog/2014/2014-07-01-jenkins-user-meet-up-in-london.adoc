I'll be visiting London in early September, and if possible I'd love to organize some get together of Jenkins users/devs. I wonder if anyone is interested in hosting the event? +

I think it just needs to fit 20 or so people, so all we need is a single conference room somewhere in London. If you think you might be able to help, please drop us a note at http://lists.jenkins-ci.org/pipermail/jenkins-events/[the events list].
