As the Jenkins project grows, https://jenkins-ci.org/content/come-join-infra-team[the need for our infrastructure has been growing]. https://ci.jenkins.io/[Our Jenkins-on-Jenkins] needs more build agents, we need more servers to run our infrastructure services. +

And it was https://jenkins-ci.org/content/big-thanks-rackspace[once again] Rackspace who stepped up to the plate; they have kindly donated us more https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/servers/[cloud servers]. I also use Rackspace for one of my personal servers, and when I went back to their admin console this time, I noticed that they've added https://www.rackspace.com/cloud/[a lot more services] to their offering. +

I am setting up these boxes as I write this. A huge thank you for Rackspace for their support of this project. And if you are interested in using Rackspace cloud servers as elastic build agents, https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/JClouds+Plugin[jclouds plugin] is your friend.
