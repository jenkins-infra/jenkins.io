Over the past 30 days or so, https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness/[the acceptance test project] has made a great progress. +

This project consists of a reusable harness that can be used by plugin developers and users to write functional test cases. These tests can be run against Jenkins instances that are deployed in https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness/blob/master/docs/CONTROLLER.md[all sorts of different ways], and can interact with https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness/blob/master/docs/FIXTURES.md[complex real fixtures]. These tests can be also run with specific version of Jenkins core and a combination of plugins. +

The number of tests have https://jenkins.ci.cloudbees.com/job/core/job/acceptance-test-harness/[steadily increased to above 300]. Several of those are by https://github.com/eidottermihi[Michael Prankl], where he tests https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness/blob/master/src/test/java/plugins/LdapPluginTest.java[the LDAP plugin with the real OpenLDAP server instance] that runs inside Docker — a kind of test that just wasn't possible before can be now easily written. +

https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness/graphs/contributors[More than a dozen people] have contributed. https://github.com/jenkinsci/acceptance-test-harness/commits/master[A dozen changes are going in every single day], and more are coming — for example, Stephen is working on modularizing this harness and adding new pieces that allow people to do scalability and load testing. That'll be a part of this effort soon. +

If you are one of the large scale users who are interested in automating some of your Jenkins acceptance testing, please https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-dev[drop us a note at the DEV list] so that we can work together. You can also watch the recording of our last https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Office+Hours[office hours] where I demoed how you'd develop a test on top of this: +

I think we all agree that this is an important effort/ Looking forward to joining the efforts with more people in the community! +
