I've uploaded pictures I've taken during JUC Boston and JUC Berlin.<br/>
<br/>

<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/12508267@N00/sets/72157645016261249/">JUC Berlin pictures</a> starts with pre-conference beer garden meet-up. See <a href="https://github.com/vlatombe">Vincent Latombe</a> gives a talk about <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Literate+Plugin">Literate plugin</a>. I really appreciated his coming to this despite the fact that the event was only a few days before his wedding:<br/>

In <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/12508267@N00/sets/72157645015219907/">JUC Boston pictures</a>, you can see some nice Jenkins lighting effect, as well as my fellow colleague Corey Phelan using World Cup to lure attendees into a booth:<br/>
