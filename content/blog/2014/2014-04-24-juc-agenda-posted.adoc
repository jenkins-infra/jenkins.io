Agenda is posted for Jenkins User Conference https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/boston[Boston] and https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/berlin[Berlin]. +

For Boston, my favorite would be the https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/boston/sessions#JesseGlick[workflow in Jenkins] talk that will cover the new workflow job type Jesse and I are working on. As of this writing it is still very much a work in progress, but that talk is our way of putting a stake on the ground that we WILL have something we can talk about by then. There's also some talks that describes how they've put together pieces (including Jenkins) to create a broad automation, such as https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/boston/sessions#HoiTsang[Distributed Scrum Development with Jenkins, Vagrant, Fabric and Selenium] and https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/boston/sessions#JimCrossley[Moving Existing Enterprise Systems to Continuous Integration and Deployment with Jenkins]. +

For Berlin, it turns out that we have steller line up of the speakers far beyond my expectation. You have a number of key community contributors/developers like https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/berlin/speakers#ChristopherOrr[Christopher Orr] talking about https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/berlin/sessions#ChristopherOrr[how he does mobile build/test/deploy], or https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/berlin/speakers#VincentLatombe[Vincent] talking about https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Literate+Plugin[literate plugin]. I'm also looking forward to the https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/berlin/sessions#JulienPivotto[Puppetizing Jenkins Pipelines] from Julien Pivotto, which (if I understand correctly) is about deploying Jenkins and its jobs through Puppet â€” That is something I notice many people are very interested in nowadays. +

All of them are looking forward to meeting you and hearing your thoughts and feedbacks, and I'm sure this is going to be a great learning/networking opportunities. +
