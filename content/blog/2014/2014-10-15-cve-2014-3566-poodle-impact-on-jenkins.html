Another day, another SSL vulnerability! Google has <a href="https://poodle.io/">announced a vulnerability in SSL v3</a>, and if you are using the "Winstone" servlet container built into Jenkins, and if you are using the HTTPS connector with the <tt>--httpsPort</tt> option (it is off by default), then you are vulnerable to this problem.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
I've just issued <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/SECURITY/Jenkins+Security+Advisory+2014-10-15">a security advisory</a> on this. If you haven't already subscribed to <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Security+Advisories">the Jenkins security advisory mailing list</a>, this is a great opportunity to do so.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
The advisory includes the target delivery vehicles for the fix and how you can address the problem in the mean time. Inside corporate intranet, where Jenkins is typically used, I suppose there's a degree of trust among participants to make this less of a problem. But if you run an internet facing Jenkins, be sure to deploy the fix.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
(And as I write this, I've fixed all the <tt>https://*.jenkins-ci.org</tt> servers to disable SSLv3, so we are covered there)
