I am very much looking forward to the Jenkins User Conference in Berlin next week which I will be attending with a three other members of my team. We are all very passionate about automation, infrastructure-as-code, configuration management and of course… Jenkins. +
 +
My team and I specialize in implementing continuous delivery for large scale transformation deliveries. We work with a wide range of technologies from open source, packaged products, through to software-as-a-service. We work with physical infrastructure, private cloud, public cloud and platforms-as-a-service, but there is one almost uniquely common factor… using Jenkins. +
 +
At the conference I will be expecting to exchange views with others using Jenkins at similar scale and am particularly interested in https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/berlin/sessions#JosefFuchshuber[sessions] covering using Jenkins with Docker and making Jenkins https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/berlin/sessions#HarpreetSingh[more resilient]. +
 +
I am also looking forward to presenting https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/berlin/sessions#MarkRendell[this lightening talk] where I will be demoing ways in which we’ve extended Jenkins to implement complex integrated pipelines for large-scale software implementations. https://markosrendell.wordpress.com/2014/05/28/reducing-continuous-delivery-impedance-part-2-solution-complexity/[See here] for a sneak preview.
