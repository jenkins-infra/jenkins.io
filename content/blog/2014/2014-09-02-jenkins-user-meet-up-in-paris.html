My apologies for the last minute announcement, but there will be a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/203261692/">Jenkins user meet-up in Paris on Sep 10th 7:00pm</a>, which is just next week. The event is hosted by Zenika. You'll hear from <a href="https://twitter.com/gboissinot">Gregory Boissinot</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alecharp">Adrien Lecharpentier</a> about plugin development, and I'll be talking about workflow.<br/>
<br/>

It's been a while we do a meet-up in Paris. Looking forward to seeing as many of you as possible. The event is free, but <a href="https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/203261692/">please RSVP</a> so that we know what to expect.
