https://jenkins-ci.org/content/jenkins-user-meet-london[As I was alluding to earlier], I was hoping to have a meetup of Jenkins users in London for a while. I'm happy to report that https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/198004202/[the agenda is final and RSVP is open]! The date is September 8th. +

I'll talk about my recent chef/puppet integration work in Jenkins. Sven from Perforce will talk about how to leverage Perforce features from Jenkins, and then James Nord will talk about workflow. It will be a worthy 2 hours. +

If the line up of talks will not be enough to sway you, you should also know that I will bring some Jenkins giveaways! +

I'm not sure how many people to expect, but there's a cap at 80 people, so if you are thinking about coming, https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/198004202/[be sure to RSVP]. Looking forward to seeing many of you there! +

Finally, if you are in London, the usual suspects (CloudBees, PuppetLabs, XebiaLabs, MidVision, SOASTA, et al) are doing https://www.eventbrite.com/e/how-to-accelerate-innovation-with-continuous-delivery-london-tickets-12229265061[a free event titled "How To Accelerate Innovation with Continuous Delivery"] that you might also be interested in.
