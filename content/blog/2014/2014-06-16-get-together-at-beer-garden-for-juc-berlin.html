There'll be a number of active community people in the event, so let's take advantages of that and meet up. And there's no better place to do it than a beer garden in summer!<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
If you are coming to <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/berlin">JUC Berlin</a>, I've just set up <a href="https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/189413622/">an RSVP page for a beer garden get together the day before</a>, and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/189405872/">another dinner afterward</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Looking forward to seeing you!
