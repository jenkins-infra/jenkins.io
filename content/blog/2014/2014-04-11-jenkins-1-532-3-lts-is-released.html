Starting with the next 1.554.x LTS, the release model will <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/LTS+Release+Line">switch to the train model</a>, where we commit to dates and get whatever we can ship by that date. <br/>

Backporting window for 1.554.1 is almost closing, so if you want to have your favorite issues nominated for it, please see <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/LTS+Release+Line">the process</a> in the Wiki and hurry!
