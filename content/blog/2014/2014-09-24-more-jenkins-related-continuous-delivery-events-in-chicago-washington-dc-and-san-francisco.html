The usual suspects, such as CloudBees, XebiaLabs, SOASTA, PuppetLabs, et al are <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/cdsummit/">doing a Jenkins-themed continuous delivery event series</a> called "cdSummit." The event is free, has a nice mix of user/vendor talks, and has an appeal to managers and team leads who are working on and struggling with continuous delivery and automation.<br/>
<br/>

I've spoken in the past events, and I enjoyed the high-level pitches from various speakers.<br/>
The last two events at Paris and London filled up completely, so I suspect others have liked them, too.<br/>

If you live near Chicago, Washington DC, or San Francisco, check out the date and see if you can make it. <a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/cdsummit/">RSVP is from here</a>. If you do, be sure to pick up Jenkins stickers and pin badges!
