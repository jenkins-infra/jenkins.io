This year marks the butler’s first conference tour to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England[New England]. He has chosen https://www.seaportboston.com/[the fabulous Seaport hotel] on the waterfront for a venue — a hotel that's far better than what I usually stay in :-). You can even take a water taxi to https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Boston[see the sites] or get to and from the airport. For airport transfers, you can also just hop on https://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/subway/lines/?route=SILVER[the silver line bus] and arrive across the street from the hotel (the stop is called "https://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/subway/lines/stations/?stopId=25092&lat=42.349098&lng=-71.04206[World Trade Center Station]".) +

This year we have https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins/juc-2014/boston[an incredible line-up of speakers]. Attendees will be well fed, caffeinated, and even pickled if they choose... the afternoon break will feature BEvERages. And everyone gets this year’s Jenkins World Tour t-shirt. +

Nothing about conference-throwing is cheap, so we’d like to take a moment to thank our generous JUC US East sponsors. It speaks so well for the JUC community that so many companies have stepped up to support Jenkins and produce a first-class conference. So here is the shout-out for them: +
