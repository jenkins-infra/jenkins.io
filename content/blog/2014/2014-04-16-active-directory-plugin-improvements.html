One of the few plugins that I still personally maintain is <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Active+Directory+plugin">Active Directory plugin</a>. In the past few months, I've been making steady improvements in this plugin, thanks to various inputs and bug reports given to me from the ClodBees customers.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
One of the recent fixes was to get <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-9258">the "remember me" feature</a> finally working for Active Directory. This requires a relatively new Jenkins 1.556, but it eliminates the need to having to constantly type the password in. <br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
Then I've rebumped the version of <a href="https://github.com/kohsuke/com4j">COM4J</a>, which was <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-16429">causing a thread leak</a> when Jenkins runs on Windows. If you are running a Windows deployment with lots of active users, this probably would have contributed to the instability of Jenkins.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
And then lastly, a small but crucial improvement was made to the way we search group membership, so that we can avoid recursively searching AD. This should result in a significant speed improvement when you are logging into Jenkins through AD.<br/>
<br/>
<p><br/>
The latest version of the plugin as of writing is 1.37. I hope you'll have a chance to update the plugin soon.<br/>
