InfoQ has been <a href="https://www.infoq.com/research/ci-server">running a CI server survey</a> for more than a month now, and here is the current result:<br/>

Jenkins has gotten more than 70% of the votes, once again proving the wide adoption among developers. If you are one of those who picked Cruise Control into the "considering" section, I'd encourage you to look around a bit more.<br/>

You can still <a href="https://www.infoq.com/research/ci-server">vote from their website or leave comments if you want</a>.<br/>

By the way, the design of two axes make no sense to me; for example, I'd order the adoption axis to "considering -> migrating to -> using now -> moving away from", and the circle seems to imply two axes are somehow interchangeable, when it should probably be just in a checkerboard to indicate those are independent axes.
