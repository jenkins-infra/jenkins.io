    Have a beer while learning how to write Jenkins plugin. Steve Christou, Jenkins support engineer will lead this lecture from 3:30pm to 6:00pm. He will<br/>
teach everything from how to get started, to techniques like writing a new    <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Jenkins+CLI">CLI Command</a>, to writing your own builder.<br/>
