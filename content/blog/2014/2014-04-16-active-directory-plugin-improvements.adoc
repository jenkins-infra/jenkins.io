One of the few plugins that I still personally maintain is https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Active+Directory+plugin[Active Directory plugin]. In the past few months, I've been making steady improvements in this plugin, thanks to various inputs and bug reports given to me from the ClodBees customers. +
 +

 +
One of the recent fixes was to get https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-9258[the "remember me" feature] finally working for Active Directory. This requires a relatively new Jenkins 1.556, but it eliminates the need to having to constantly type the password in. +
 +

 +
Then I've rebumped the version of https://github.com/kohsuke/com4j[COM4J], which was https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-16429[causing a thread leak] when Jenkins runs on Windows. If you are running a Windows deployment with lots of active users, this probably would have contributed to the instability of Jenkins. +
 +

 +
And then lastly, a small but crucial improvement was made to the way we search group membership, so that we can avoid recursively searching AD. This should result in a significant speed improvement when you are logging into Jenkins through AD. +
 +

 +
The latest version of the plugin as of writing is 1.37. I hope you'll have a chance to update the plugin soon. +
