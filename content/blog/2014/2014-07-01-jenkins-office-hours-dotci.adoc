Tomorrow in Jenkins office hours, Surya Gaddipati will be going over https://github.com/jenkinsci/dotci[DotCi], a package of features that integrates Jenkins closely with GitHub, configuration via .ci.yml file in source tree, built-in Docker support and MongoDB backend. +

I think there's a number of interesting pieces here that could be split into individual plugins for reuse, and possible alignment with existing efforts like https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Script+Security+Plugin[Script Security plugin] or https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Literate+Plugin[Literate plugin]. +

To record the show, https://plus.google.com/events/cmatf87mb6cfo090e063l10709g[this event will be in a different hangout from the usual one], but https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Jenkins+Office+Hours&iso=20140702T11&p1=224&ah=1&sort=1[the time is the same]. Looking forward to seeing you!
