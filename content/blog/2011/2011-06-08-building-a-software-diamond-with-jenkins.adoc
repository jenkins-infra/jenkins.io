Alternatively: *How to make your parallel jobs kick one last job at the end*

Many of us have had occasion to think: "_I could make this project build quicker if I could just run parts in parallel and then one final job to wrap it up._"

Well, good news! Jenkins is here to help!  With the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Join+Plugin[Join Plugin] you can do just that.  Over on the confluence page it's got a number of examples and fancy flow charts.  But the take-away is that if you can describe the flow, you can make it happen.  But you're saying "wait, I need to pass information around between the jobs."

We've got that one covered for you too with the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Parameterized+Trigger+Plugin[Parameterized Trigger Plugin].  And here's the best part, these two can work together!  With both plugins installed you can follow the steps listed in the Build Parameters section of the Join Plugin.+++<center>+++image:https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/join_trigger.png[Click to enlarge,540,link=https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/join_trigger.png]+++</center>+++

And as they say, _now you're cooking with gas!_
