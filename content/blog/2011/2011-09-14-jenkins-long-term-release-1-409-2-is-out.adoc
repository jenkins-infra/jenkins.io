We just posted the updated Long-term Release (LTS) of 1.409.2. +

Just as a recap, with LTS releases, we plan on providing a release train that only has backported changes. 1.409.2 contains https://jenkins-ci.org/changelog-stable[a handful of important bug fixes] since 1.409.1. For more about LTS, https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/LTS+Release+Line[see this wiki page]. +

Thanks to the heroic effort of those who are involved, namely Vojtech Juranek and a bunch of heroes, this release went through a rather rigorous testing, including all the automated tests we have plus https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/LTS+1.409.x+RC+Testing[a considerable number of manual eye-ball tests]. +

To download, click the "Long-Term Support Release" tab from https://jenkins-ci.org/[the top page]. If you've already been using LTS, you should start receiving update notifications soon.
