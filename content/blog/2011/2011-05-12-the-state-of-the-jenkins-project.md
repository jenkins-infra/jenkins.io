A few weeks ago our very own [Kohsuke Kawaguchi](https://www.twitter.com/kohsukekawa) gave a presentation at the [Silicon Valley CI Summit](https://events.linkedin.com/Silicon-Valley-Continuous-Integration/pub/591454) held in Mountain View.

Within the presentation, Kohsuke included a collection of numbers about the vibrancy of the Jenkins project that certainly hasn't gotten enough attention. While the slideshow is embedded below, here's some good high-level points:

 * Over 170 [GitHub](https://github.com/jenkinsci) pull requests in the past four months, with more being sent every day.
 * Formalization of a "Jenkins Stable" branch of development with longer release cycles and back-ported bugfixes.
 * Over 280 tickets in [JIRA](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org) have been resolved.
 * After posting a "special" release of Hudson which presents users with a choice, **87.25%** are choosing to upgrade to Jenkins.
 * Over 500 tickets have been created
 * Roughly 13,000 downloads of `jenkins.war` and native packages a week
 * **New** and vibrant community-driven initiatives like [Frederic Camblor's](https://twitter.com/fcamblor) plugin compatibility tester and [Charles Lowell's](https://twitter.com/cowboyd) JRuby plugin support project.
 * We've crossed 1500 participants on the `jenkinsci-user` mailing list, and are over 900 participants on the `jenkinsci-dev` list.
 * The [@jenkinsci](https://twitter.com/jenkinsci) twitter account recently crossed the 4,000 follower threshold.

On a personal note, I think this speaks all to the level of unbridled enthusiasm about the future of Jenkins by contributors both new and old. 

Without further delay, the slides:
