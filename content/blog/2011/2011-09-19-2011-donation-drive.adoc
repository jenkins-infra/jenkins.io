Since the end of April, Jenkins has been officially part of the
https://www.spi-inc.org[SPI] (Software
in the Public Interest), an umbrella organization which offers a useful level
of legal status for the project.

Up until recently we had not taken proper advantage of this new legal
umbrella, thankfully that's changed as we're now capable of *link:/donate/[accepting
donations!]*

For the project this is a big step forward as it will allow us to offset the
cost of servers for the project, bandwidth, SSL certificates and other costs
incurred as part of running such a large open source project.

Since we're now able to accept donations, we're kicking off a donation drive to
help recover some of the costs incurred this summer (link:/content/mirror-mirror-wall[which I've discussed
previously]). Our immediate goal is to raise $5130
to recoup bandwidth costs, if you can spare some change, head on over to the
https://co.clickandpledge.com/advanced/default.aspx?wid=46160[SPI online donation
page] and help
us out :)
