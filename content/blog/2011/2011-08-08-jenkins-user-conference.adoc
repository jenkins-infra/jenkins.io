image:/images/user.svg[] We've done meetups, we've done sessions, we've done workshops, now it's about time we went ahead and did user conference don't you think?

Our pals over at CloudBees (Harpeet specifically) have taken the initiative in starting to organize just that: a *https://blog.cloudbees.com/2011/08/jenkins-user-conference.html[Jenkins User Conference]* on *October 2nd*.

If you have your calendar at the ready, you'll notice that October 2nd is the Sunday before JavaOne kicks off this year in San Francisco.

The details are still coming together, but a https://blog.cloudbees.com/2011/08/jenkins-user-conference-proposed-agenda.html[proposed agenda] has already been posted by Harpeet.

As this is a community event, I'll be sure to keep the updates coming on this site but you may want to add the https://blog.cloudbees.com/[CloudBees' Blog] to your feed reader just in case (or just follow them on Twitter: https://twitter.com/cloudbees[@CloudBees]).
