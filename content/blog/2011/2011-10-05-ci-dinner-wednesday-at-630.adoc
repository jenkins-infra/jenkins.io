While there are plenty of folks in town for JavaOne, I wanted to host a meetup/dinner at *https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-chaat-san-francisco-4[Cafe Chaat]* here in San Francisco.

If you're coming from JavaOne directly, use https://g.co/maps/dwwzj[these directions]

If you're coming from Oracle OpenWorld, use https://g.co/maps/2db79[these directions]

https://twitter.com/kohsukekawa[Kohsuke] will be in attendance as will some other Jenkins User Conference speakers, so if you still have left-over questions, I'm sure you can get them answered before the last of the https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Lassi#Mango_lassi[Mango Lassi] is finished!

Look forward to seeing you there!
