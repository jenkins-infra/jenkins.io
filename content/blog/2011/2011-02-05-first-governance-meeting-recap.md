As mentioned [on Friday](/content/governance-meeting-today) the Jenkins project held it's first meeting on the [IRC channel](/content/chat) at the request of the interim board. In the interest of transparency, we recorded meeting minutes and tried to involve as many folks as possible.

#### Topics Covered

 * **Proposal/Discussion of Jenkins project governance structure**
 * **What to do about the logo**
 * **Registering the Jenkins trademark**
 * **Moving Jenkins under an umbrella organization**
 * **What shall we do with a new CLA?**
 * **Logistics for the next project meeting**

If you're interested, you can read through the [full logs](https://meetings.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins/2011/jenkins.2011-02-04-23.02.log.html) or just look over the high-level [meeting minutes](https://meetings.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins/2011/jenkins.2011-02-04-23.02.html).

This first meeting went a bit long due to the massive amount of items needing to be discussed, so the project has scheduled another meeting for **Wednesday Feb 9, 11am PST (19:00 UTC)**; mark your calendars!

Thanks to everybody who participated, we'll see you again next time.
