Better late than never right? Back in June, during his world tour, [Andrew Bayer](https://twitter.com/abayer) stopped by Munich to participate in a Jenkins Meetup along with Dr. Ullrich Hafner.

Andrew gave a talk titled "The State of Jenkins" ([slides](https://video.tngtech.com/veranstaltungen/2011/06-30Jenkins/The_State_of_Jenkins.pdf)) and Ullrich talked about "Static Code Analysis with Jenkins" ([slides](https://video.tngtech.com/veranstaltungen/2011/06-30Jenkins/Static_Code_Analysis_With_Jenkins.pdf))

You can view the videos on [this page](https://video.tngtech.com/veranstaltungen/2011/06-30Jenkins/#) hosted by [TNG](https://www.tngtech.com).

*Thanks to Stefan Wolf for the heads up!*
