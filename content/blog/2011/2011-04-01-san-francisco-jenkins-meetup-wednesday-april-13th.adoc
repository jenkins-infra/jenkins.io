The meetup will start at 6:30 - you can find more information https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/17090726/[here]. https://twitter.com/drnic[Dr Nic Williams of Engine Yard] will talk about their use of Jenkins with Ruby, and Kohsuke will give an update on the JRuby plugin development work he and https://twitter.com/cowboyd[cowboyd] have been working on. If you're interesting in giving a short talk on your usage of Jenkins, plugin work, or whatever, there should be time for an open mic. Hope to see you there!
