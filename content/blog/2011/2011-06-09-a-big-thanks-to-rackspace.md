This post is long over-due and I really apologize for that.

Some months ago we put out the call for "more slave machines!" through the
mailing lists, sky-writers and twitter. We had a serious problem, for a
continuous integration project, a **large** number of our plugins and
dependencies weren't being built in a continuous and automated fashion!

We had some builds on a couple of flakey machines on home connections
contributed by various individuals, until Rackspace stepped up in a **big**
way and donated an infrastructure server for the project to use.

For months now, just about all plugins and core have been built and tested on `spinach`,
the always-on machine in the Rackspace Cloud. Dutifully chugging away building
core, plugin after plugin and occasionally getting flooded with work from [Frederic
Camblor's](https://twitter.com/fcamblor) plugin compatibility tester!

In hindsight, having a powerful infrastructure machine for nothing other than
builds has helped us build great software faster; I can't imagine how difficult
things might be otherwise.


I've personally had a lot of interaction with Rackspace engineers through the [OpenStack
project](https://www.openstack.org/) and have a number of friends who operate businesses on
Rackspace/Rackspace Cloud hybrid infrastructures. 

The folks at Rackspace are
top notch and I can't thank them enough for contributing to the Jenkins
project.
