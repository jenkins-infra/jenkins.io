Amongst all the work this week with setting up project infrastructure, http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org/war/1.396/[the first release of Jenkins] and a _flood_ of developer activity https://github.com/jenkinsci[on GitHub], the interim governance board has decided to hold periodic virtual meetings.

The first meeting will be held *today* at 3pm PST (23:00 UTC) in the `#jenkins` channel on IRC (https://jenkins-ci.org/content/chat[more details here]).

In https://twitter.com/kohsukekawa/[Kohsuke's] post to the mailing list, he further explained the goals of such meetings:

____
We can use it to report/discuss various issues of the project (not bugs in code, but more project level stuff.) I also plan to report the infrastructure work that's done thus far.

We'd like to hear from you, and the point is to engage the broader community, so please join us.

This is a new thing, so it's not like we've figured this all out, but let's see how it goes.
____

If you don't have an IRC client, you can use the Freenode https://webchat.freenode.net/[webchat client] to join in, hope to see you there!
