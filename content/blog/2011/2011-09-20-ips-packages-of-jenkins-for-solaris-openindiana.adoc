Image Packaging System (IPS) is a new package manager Sun has developed for OpenSolaris. While I have my doubts about whether a brand-new package manager was a good way of spending engineering resources, OpenSolaris had a number of very nice features that made it a convincing platform to run Jenkins, thanks to SMF, ZFS, and zones. So I used to produce IPS packages for Jenkins. I lost the ability to do this as I left Oracle and lost access to a Solaris system, but https://www.dev-eth0.de/jenkins-continuous-integration-on-opensolaris/[a recent blog post] renewed my interest. +

So I'm happy to announce that the Jenkins project has started producing https://ips.jenkins-ci.org/[IPS packages for the releases]. With this addition, the Jenkins project now produces 9 packages on different platforms (10, if you count https://rubygems.org/gems/jenkins-war[Ruby as a separate platform] :-) +
