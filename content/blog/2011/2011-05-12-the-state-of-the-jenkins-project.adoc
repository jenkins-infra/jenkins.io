A few weeks ago our very own https://www.twitter.com/kohsukekawa[Kohsuke Kawaguchi] gave a presentation at the https://events.linkedin.com/Silicon-Valley-Continuous-Integration/pub/591454[Silicon Valley CI Summit] held in Mountain View.

Within the presentation, Kohsuke included a collection of numbers about the vibrancy of the Jenkins project that certainly hasn't gotten enough attention. While the slideshow is embedded below, here's some good high-level points:

* Over 170 https://github.com/jenkinsci[GitHub] pull requests in the past four months, with more being sent every day.
* Formalization of a "Jenkins Stable" branch of development with longer release cycles and back-ported bugfixes.
* Over 280 tickets in https://issues.jenkins.io[JIRA] have been resolved.
* After posting a "special" release of Hudson which presents users with a choice, *87.25%* are choosing to upgrade to Jenkins.
* Over 500 tickets have been created
* Roughly 13,000 downloads of `jenkins.war` and native packages a week
* *New* and vibrant community-driven initiatives like https://twitter.com/fcamblor[Frederic Camblor's] plugin compatibility tester and https://twitter.com/cowboyd[Charles Lowell's] JRuby plugin support project.
* We've crossed 1500 participants on the `jenkinsci-user` mailing list, and are over 900 participants on the `jenkinsci-dev` list.
* The https://twitter.com/jenkinsci[@jenkinsci] twitter account recently crossed the 4,000 follower threshold.

On a personal note, I think this speaks all to the level of unbridled enthusiasm about the future of Jenkins by contributors both new and old.
