Over drinks this evening [Kohsuke](https://twitter.com/kohsukekawa) pointed out that he never saw a blog post about [PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com).

If you've never worked in a sysadmin role or in any other position that would require an on-call rotation, then you may have never seen PagerDuty.

In essence the service provides a great series of integration points with Pingdom or Nagios for handling monitoring. As an infrastructure guy (part time), I can honestly say it's a great tool and I'm grateful to PagerDuty for supporting Jenkins with our own account to help manage project infrastructure. 

A couple weekends ago I finished setting up [Nagios](https://nagios.jenkins-ci.org/nagios3/) (read-only username/password: `jenkins`/`jenkins`) for critical project services which by itself is a good step forward. Combine that with PagerDuty's Nagios integration and a solid on-call rotation, and I'm more confident than I've ever been that Kohsuke or myself could actually take a vacation!

Check them out, and be sure to thank them on Twitter at [@PagerDuty](https://twitter.com/pagerduty) for supporting Jenkins!
