I've just added three events coming up in the next few weeks to [the Jenkins calendar](/event-calendar). Conveniently, they are all events I'll be attending while traveling around Western Europe!

* [The Cologne JUG](https://jugcologne.org) is having a meetup on Saturday, June 25th, starting at 2pm. We'll be talking about Jenkins, maybe doing some coding, and then heading out for drinks and more talk! You can find more information and sign up at [Xing](https://www.xing.com/events/jugc-jenkins-town-763587).

* A few days later, TNG Technology Consulting is generously hosting a meetup in Munich, on Wednesday, June 30th, starting at 3pm. I'll be giving a quick talk on the state of the Jenkins project, followed by Ullrich Haffner (the author of the static analysis plugins for Jenkins) giving a quick talk on how those plugins are used. After that, we'll be having a hackathon, and then more beer! Again, you can find more information and sign up at [Xing](https://www.xing.com/events/jenkins-treffen-munchen-30-06-2011-776226).

* A week later, the London CI meetup group is hosting a meetup as well, on Wednesday, July 6th, starting at 6:30pm. We'll be meeting up at the Royal Festival Hall for discussion and drinking. You can find more information and sign up at [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Continuous-Integration-London/events/21752121/).

Do you have a Jenkins event you'd like to have added to [our calendar](/event-calendar)? Let us know!
