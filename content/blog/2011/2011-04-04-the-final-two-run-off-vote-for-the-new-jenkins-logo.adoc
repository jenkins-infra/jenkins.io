A https://jenkins-ci.org/content/polls-are-open-jenkins-logo-contest[little over a week ago] we opened the polls to the larger user-base to vote for the *_new and improved_* Jenkins logo. After receiving hundreds of votes, we are now ready to enter the final round of voting (click images to see larger versions in a new window).

Voting will *end* April 9th at 23:59 UTC, so make sure to tell your friends, coworkers and bus drivers to get their votes in as soon as possible!
