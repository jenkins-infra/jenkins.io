Our link:/content/holiday-appeal-please-help-jenkins-pay-project-expense[earlier appeal] for donation was a drastic boost to link:/donate/[our fund-raising drive], (and looking at the twitter reactions, it feels like the Wikipedia parody we put on https://ci.jenkins-ci.org/[Jenkins on Jenkins] helped spread the words &mdash; I guess jokes do work!

And I'm happy to report that we've successfully raised over $12000 as of today. That's more than enough to pay off all the current balance and it should keep the project going for quite a while. I've assembled https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Donors[the donor list] in appreciation.

So once again, thanks everyone for their generous support!
