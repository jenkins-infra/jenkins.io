As if https://jenkins-ci.org/content/report-bugs-and-win-kindle[getting a Kindle for reporting bugs] and https://jenkins-ci.org/content/jenkins-community-survey[getting an AppleTV for filing a survey] aren't enough, you can also https://www.cloudbees.com/jenkins-community-contests.cb#bugbounty[win an iPad for fixing an issue]. +

So if you've been thinking about tinkering with https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/GitHub+Repositories[Jenkins code base] but haven't done so yet, this is a great opportunity to get going. There's https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Extend+Jenkins[documentation about how to get started], and there's https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Office+Hours[Jenkins Office Hours] and https://jenkins-ci.org/content/chat[IRC channel] if you need some interactive help from existing devs. I think new features, not just bug fixes, would qualify, so long as it's recorded in the issue tracker. And similarly, I think the plugins would qualify, not just core. +

Aside from iPad, there's one $50 Amazon gift certificate going out every week, which is almost a steal! So be sure to submit your entry! +
