Thanks to the kindness of https://www.bigpoint.net/[BigPoint GmbH] and Kutzi, we had the first Jenkins Hackathon in Europe, in a very large and airly conference room in their Hamburg campus, on a nice sunny Sunday of May 1st. About 10 people came, including the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Static+Code+Analysis+Plug-ins[static code analysis plugin] fame Ullrich Hafner, https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Android+Emulator+Plugin[Androd emulator plugin] fame https://twitter.com/orrc[Christopher Orr], the https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Instant+Messaging+Plugin[instant messenger plugin] (and others) fame https://twitter.com/#!/kutzi[Christoph Kutzinski]. Some of us came from pretty far away places like Munich, Bonn, and Netherland. There was a good mix of existing developers and new developers, too. +
 +

 +
During the hackathon, new folks developed whopping three plugins â€” a security realm that connects to https://github.com/jenkinsci/kerberos-authenticator-plugin[Kerberos (password entering kind, not SSO)], https://github.com/jenkinsci/builton-column-plugin[a plugin that adds a list view column to show where the last build was done], and https://github.com/jenkinsci/extra-columns-plugin/[another plugin that attempts to collect small list view column implmentations]. German translations were improved, automated installation of Android SDKs are discussed and its implementation strategies explained. I've done my share of contribution by working on https://github.com/jenkinsci/jruby-xstream[XStream support for JRuby], which is one of the ground work necessary for JRuby-based Jenkins plugin development, and I also showed the prototype Groovy-based templating that can potentially supercede Jelly. There were additional exchange of tips and tricks, how you do this and that. +
 +

 +
Strong coffee and engaged conversations kept me awake all day, although German keyboard layout (on top of usual IDE difference + Mac/PC difference) made it hard to code on other people's computers, but all in all it was a very productive hackathon. In fact, the best ever. We wrapped up around 7pm and headed to a seafood restaurant near Elbe river, stayed there until 11pm-ish. +
 +

 +
The next hackathon is planned in Paris toward the end of the month. I'm looking forward to another productive Hackathon, so if you are nearby, please https://www.meetup.com/jenkinsmeetup/events/17178842/[RSVP and join us]. +
