Over drinks this evening https://twitter.com/kohsukekawa[Kohsuke] pointed out that he never saw a blog post about https://www.pagerduty.com[PagerDuty].+++<center>+++image:https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://agentdero.cachefly.net/continuousblog/images/pagerduty_logo.png[pagerduty.com,360,link=https://www.pagerduty.com]+++</center>+++

If you've never worked in a sysadmin role or in any other position that would require an on-call rotation, then you may have never seen PagerDuty.

In essence the service provides a great series of integration points with Pingdom or Nagios for handling monitoring. As an infrastructure guy (part time), I can honestly say it's a great tool and I'm grateful to PagerDuty for supporting Jenkins with our own account to help manage project infrastructure.

A couple weekends ago I finished setting up https://nagios.jenkins-ci.org/nagios3/[Nagios] (read-only username/password: `jenkins`/`jenkins`) for critical project services which by itself is a good step forward. Combine that with PagerDuty's Nagios integration and a solid on-call rotation, and I'm more confident than I've ever been that Kohsuke or myself could actually take a vacation!

Check them out, and be sure to thank them on Twitter at https://twitter.com/pagerduty[@PagerDuty] for supporting Jenkins!
