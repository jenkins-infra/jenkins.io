As you might have noticed [Jenkins](https://twitter.com/jenkinsci/) finally has
a **brand spankin' new logo!** Over the past couple weeks we've run two series
of votes, [one for the initial 11 logo
submissions](https://jenkins-ci.org/content/polls-are-open-jenkins-logo-contest)
and then a final, run-off election, for the [two most popular
choices](https://jenkins-ci.org/content/final-two-run-vote-new-jenkins-logo).
I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everybody that submitted logos! It
is incredibly flattering to have so many people passionate about the project
and willing to spend the time creating new art for us.

At the end of the votes, there was a clear winner though, everybody seems to
really love the submission by the folks over at [The
FrontSide](https://thefrontside.net/) which you can see adorning this very page.

If you'd like to download the SVG version of the logo, or the variants in different sizes, I've gone ahead and uploaded a tarball and all the variants to [this directory](http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org/art/), there is also a good [color palette here](http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org/art/jenkins_colors.pdf) (*obligatory PDF warning*).

Once again, thank you to **everybody** that participated!
