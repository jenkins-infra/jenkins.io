Amongst all the work this week with setting up project infrastructure, [the first release of Jenkins](http://mirrors.jenkins-ci.org/war/1.396/) and a *flood* of developer activity [on GitHub](https://github.com/jenkinsci), the interim governance board has decided to hold periodic virtual meetings.


The first meeting will be held **today** at 3pm PST (23:00 UTC) in the `#jenkins` channel on IRC ([more details here](https://jenkins-ci.org/content/chat)). 

In [Kohsuke's](https://twitter.com/kohsukekawa/) post to the mailing list, he further explained the goals of such meetings:

> We can use it to report/discuss various issues of the project (not bugs in code, but more project level stuff.) I also plan to report the infrastructure work that's done thus far.
> 
> We'd like to hear from you, and the point is to engage the broader community, so please join us.
> 
> This is a new thing, so it's not like we've figured this all out, but let's see how it goes.

If you don't have an IRC client, you can use the Freenode [webchat client](https://webchat.freenode.net/) to join in, hope to see you there!
