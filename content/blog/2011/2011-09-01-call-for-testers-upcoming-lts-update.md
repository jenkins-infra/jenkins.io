A [couple of months
ago](/content/jenkins-long-term-support-release) Jenkins embarked on an new project, the
Jenkins "LTS" (Long Term Support) release line. A LTS branch of development is
common in most major open source projects, especially those with substantial
corporate adoption, so this was a great step for the project as a whole.


We're now coming up on the second LTS release, which will be an incremental
update to the previous one (1.409.1) with only the most important fixes
back-ported to the branch.

**Now** is when we need your help.


We need testers and interested parties from the community to help verify the
stability of the planned LTS update, 1.409.2, which is now in the release
candidate stages.

The testing of 1.409.2 has been spearheaded by community member `vjuranek` who
has created [this **fantastic test
matrix**](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/LTS+1.409.x+RC+Testing) to
help coordinate testing of release candidates.


The LTS project is entirely community driven, so your input is invaluable in making
these releases successful.


If you're interested in helping, speak up on the [-dev mailing
list](/content/mailing-lists) and start pitching in on the test matrix!
