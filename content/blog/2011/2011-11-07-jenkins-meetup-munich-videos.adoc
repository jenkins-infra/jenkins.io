Better late than never right? Back in June, during his world tour, https://twitter.com/abayer[Andrew Bayer] stopped by Munich to participate in a Jenkins Meetup along with Dr. Ullrich Hafner.

Andrew gave a talk titled "The State of Jenkins" (https://video.tngtech.com/veranstaltungen/2011/06-30Jenkins/The_State_of_Jenkins.pdf[slides]) and Ullrich talked about "Static Code Analysis with Jenkins" (https://video.tngtech.com/veranstaltungen/2011/06-30Jenkins/Static_Code_Analysis_With_Jenkins.pdf[slides])

You can view the videos on https://video.tngtech.com/veranstaltungen/2011/06-30Jenkins/#[this page] hosted by https://www.tngtech.com[TNG].

_Thanks to Stefan Wolf for the heads up!_
