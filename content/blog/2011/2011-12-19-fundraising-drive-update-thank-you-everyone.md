Our <a href="/content/holiday-appeal-please-help-jenkins-pay-project-expense">earlier appeal</a> for donation was a drastic boost to <a href="https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Donation">our fund-raising drive</a>, (and looking at the twitter reactions, it feels like the Wikipedia parody we put on <a href="https://ci.jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins on Jenkins</a> helped spread the words &mdash; I guess jokes do work!

And I'm happy to report that we've successfully raised over $12000 as of today. That's more than enough to pay off all the current balance and it should keep the project going for quite a while. I've assembled <a href="https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Donors">the donor list</a> in appreciation.

So once again, thanks everyone for their generous support!
