While there are plenty of folks in town for JavaOne, I wanted to host a meetup/dinner at **[Cafe Chaat](https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-chaat-san-francisco-4)** here in San Francisco.

If you're coming from JavaOne directly, use [these directions](https://g.co/maps/dwwzj)

If you're coming from Oracle OpenWorld, use [these directions](https://g.co/maps/2db79)

[Kohsuke](https://twitter.com/kohsukekawa) will be in attendance as will some other Jenkins User Conference speakers, so if you still have left-over questions, I'm sure you can get them answered before the last of the [Mango Lassi](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Lassi#Mango_lassi) is finished!

Look forward to seeing you there!
