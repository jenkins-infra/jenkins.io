Customized Jenkins+NUT logo derived from NUT resources and

The resulting image comes in a few versions as was needed by
different design consumers (Jenkins banner, Github Auth, etc.)
and include the base image on transparent background trimmed to
the rectangle it occupies, downscaled for 256px listing of logos,
same with padding to be a square canvas (as used in avatars),
and a downscaled image for the Jenkins dashboard banner.

Originally (in the Network UPS Tools project source repos) there
are variants in several resolutions available, and options with
a larger or smaller NUT logo served on the Jenkins butler's plate.
