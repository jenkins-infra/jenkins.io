== Overview

Thanks for your interest in reporting vulnerabilities to the Jenkins project!

Please report them in the issue tracker under the link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/SECURITY[SECURITY project].
This project is configured in such a way that only the reporter and the security team can see the details.
By restricting access to this potentially sensitive information, we can work on a fix and deliver it before the method of attack becomes well-known.

If you are unable to report using our issue tracker, you can also send your report to the private Jenkins Security Team mailing list:
`jenkinsci-cert@googlegroups.com`
We will then file an issue on your behalf.


== Scope

This section aims to clarify the scope of issues handled by the Jenkins security team.
When in doubt, we recommend you report issues to us as described above, and let us evaluate them.

=== Components

Please report issues present in the following components:

* Jenkins, including installers and Docker images published by the Jenkins project
* Jenkins plugins published by the Jenkins project (listed on https://plugins.jenkins.io/[plugins.jenkins.io] and/or hosted in https://github.com/jenkinsci[the jenkinsci GitHub organization])
* Jenkins X (see https://jenkins-x.io/security/[reporting guidelines])
* Additional components published by the Jenkins project for general use, such as Docker images


The following components are out of scope:

* Issues specific to CloudBees Jenkins products https://www.cloudbees.com/security-policy[should be reported to CloudBees directly].

=== Vulnerability Types

We do not consider the following issues to be vulnerabilities in Jenkins:

* Vulnerabilities in dependencies without a plausible or demonstrated exploit will not be treated as vulnerabilities.
  While we inform maintainers about the need to update their dependencies, and may track progress in the SECURITY Jira project, no security advisory will be published for these.
* Cookies not set to `Secure` due to misconfiguration of Jenkins.
  If a cookie is Secure on https://ci.jenkins.io, then it's a matter of configuration.
* Cookies not set to `HttpOnly` when they contain no sensitive information (e.g. "screen size")
* Users with Overall/RunScripts permission (usually implied by Overall/Administer) are able to execute arbitrary code using the Script Console, related APIs (`/eval`, `/script`, `/scriptText`), and many plugins.
  This is a feature.
* Jobs started by a specific user can run on agents where the user lacks Agent/Build permission and can themselves trigger builds of jobs where the user lacks Job/Build permission.

== Issue Handling Process

Once reported, the Jenkins security team will perform an evaluation of the issue to determine affected components and whether the report is a valid security vulnerability.
We endeavour to respond to all reports within three working days (Mon-Fri), with typical response times within one working day.

Please note that we may choose to reject issues as security vulnerabilities while still tracking them in the SECURITY project.
In those cases, the issue type will be changed accordingly.

Once an issue is ready to be published in a security advisory (typically because a fix is available, or a coordinated disclosure deadline approaches), the Jenkins project CNA will assign one or more CVE identifiers for the vulnerability, as applicable, if the issue is in scope of the Jenkins CNA.
Around this time, we will also ask the reporter how they would like to be credited in the security advisory, and post a draft of the description of the vulnerability for review.


== Issues in Plugins

Most plugins are maintained independently by contributors working exclusively on a small number of plugins.
In those cases, the Jenkins security team acts as an intermediary between reporters and maintainers, providing a single point of contact for reporters.
As part of initial issue review, the Jenkins security team will attempt to determine the current maintainer of the plugin to assign the issue to.

While it is the individual plugin maintainer's responsibility to fix security issues in their plugins, the Jenkins security team helps by providing documentation, review, and coordination of the release.

We generally ask maintainers of popular plugins to publish fixes only in coordination with the Jenkins security team to ensure that users are informed immediately about the availability of a security fix.
In plugins with only few installations, we generally recommend that maintainers release the fixes once ready and we will inform users in the next suitable security advisory about the fix.

== Coordinated/Responsible Disclosure

Please let us know in advance if your issue report is subject to a coordinated disclosure deadline.
This allows us to schedule the fix well in advance and ensure a high quality of the fix.
For example, Jenkins core is on a monthly release cadence with several weeks of testing for each release, so we would like to know well in advance when a fix is due.


== Security Advisories

We publish Jenkins core and plugin security advisories link:/security/advisories[on this site] and notify users via link:/security/#security-notifications[various mailing lists] as well as through security warnings on the Jenkins UI.
