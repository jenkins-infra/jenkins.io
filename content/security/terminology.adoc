This page provides a quick overview of commonly used security terms in Jenkins and its documentation.
While not exhaustive, it aims to clarify terminology used in security advisories and security-related documentation on this site.

## General

Attack::
As a noun, an attack is a deliberate attempt to _exploit_ a _vulnerability_ to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a system.
As a verb, it means to perform actions intended to compromise, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a system.
Attacker::
An attacker is an individual, program, or group that attempts to _exploit_ _vulnerabilities_ in a system.
Crafted::
In _vulnerability_ descriptions, "crafted" refers to input or data that has been intentionally designed or manipulated by an _attacker_ to trigger a _vulnerability_.
Exploit::
As a noun, an exploit is software, code, or a sequence of instructions that leverages a _vulnerability_ to perform an _attack_.
As a verb, it means to take advantage of a specific _vulnerability_ in a system.
Fix::
A fix is a code or configuration change that removes a _vulnerability_, thereby preventing it from being _exploited_.
Mitigation::
A mitigation is a security measure or control that reduces the chances of a _vulnerability_ being _exploited_, or lessens the damage if it is.
Unlike a _fix_, a mitigation does not necessarily eliminate the _vulnerability_.
Vulnerability::
A vulnerability is a flaw or weakness that could be leveraged by an _attacker_ to perform unauthorized actions with a security impact.

## Vulnerabilities

Command Injection::
Command injection (or OS command injection) is a _vulnerability_ that occurs when an application constructs and executes OS shell commands using unsafe user input.
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)::
CSRF _attacks_ trick a user's browser into performing unwanted actions in a web application they are logged into, often without the user's knowledge.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)::
XSS _vulnerabilities_ allow an _attacker_ to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
These scripts run within the victim's web browser and can steal sensitive data, hijack sessions, modify content, or perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.

Disclosure::
Disclosure refers to a type of _vulnerability_ where sensitive information becomes accessible to unauthorized actors.
[#pt]
Path Traversal::
A path traversal _vulnerability_ allows an _attacker_ to access files and directories that are stored outside the intended directory.
This is typically achieved by manipulating file path parameters, such as using `../` sequences, to traverse the filesystem and access sensitive resources such as configuration files or cryptographic secrets.

Remote Code Execution (RCE)::
RCE is the ability of an _attacker_ to run arbitrary code on a target system remotely, typically as a result of _exploiting_ a _vulnerability_.
In Jenkins security advisories, this generally refers to executing code inside the Jenkins JVM, as opposed to (OS) command injection, which generally refers to shell command invocations.
Each can usually be used to achieve the other, resulting in an equivalent complete compromise of Jenkins.
Note that Jenkins administrators have access to the link:/doc/book/managing/script-console/[Script Console], a feature of comparable power.
[#ssrf]
Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)::
SSRF is a _vulnerability_ in which an _attacker_ tricks the server into making unauthorized requests to internal resources or third-party services, potentially leading to data exposure or unauthorized access.
XML External Entity (XXE)::
An XXE _vulnerability_ occurs when an XML parser processes an external entity reference within an XML document.
This can enable _attackers_ to read local files (see <<pt,Path Traversal>>), perform server-side request forgery (see <<ssrf,Server-Side Request Forgery>>), or execute denial-of-service _attacks_, depending on the system configuration.
