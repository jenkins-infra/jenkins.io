  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2090 (CSRF), CVE-2020-2091 (missing permission check)
  cvss:
    severity: Low
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.47 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods performing form validation.
    This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL within the AWS region using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method.

    NOTE: This vulnerability might also allow attackers to capture credentials stored in Jenkins. We have not been able to confirm that this is possible.

    Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.48 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation methods.

  - name: ec2

  title: XXE vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2092
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.0.0 and earlier does not configure the XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

    This allows a user able to control the input files for the 'Publish Robot Framework' post-build step to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.0.1 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.

  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2093 (CSRF), CVE-2020-2094 (missing permission check)
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 3.0 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods performing form validation.
    This allows users with Overall/Read access to send an email with fixed content to an attacker-specified recipient.

    Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.0.1 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation methods.

  title: PLUGIN_NAME stored credentials in plain text
  cve: CVE-2020-2095
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.0.4 and earlier stores a NuGet API key unencrypted in job `config.xml` files as part of its configuration.
    This credential could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

    This is due to an incomplete fix of link:/security/advisory/2019-12-17/#SECURITY-1598[SECURITY-1598].

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.0.5 now stores the API key encrypted.
    Existing jobs need to have their configuration saved for existing plain text passwords to be overwritten.

  - name: redgate-sql-ci
    previous: 2.0.4
    fixed: 2.0.5

  title: Reflected XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2096
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.4.2 and earlier does not escape project names in the `build_now` endpoint.
    This results in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

  - name: gitlab-hook
    previous: 1.4.2

  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME allow OS command execution
  cve: CVE-2020-2097 (permission check), CVE-2020-2098 (CSRF)
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 0.5 and earlier does not perform permission checks in URLs performing form validation.
    This allows attackers with Overall/Read access to execute arbitrary OS commands as the OS user account running Jenkins.

    Additionally, these form validation URLs do not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
