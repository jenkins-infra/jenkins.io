  title: Missing permission check in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2024-52549
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1367.vdf2fc45f229c and earlier, except 1365.1367.va_3b_b_89f8a_95b_ and 1362.1364.v4cf2dc5d8776, does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to check for the existence of files on the controller file system.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1368.vb_b_402e3547e7 requires Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation method.

  title: Rebuilding a run with revoked script approval allowed by PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2024-52550
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 3990.vd281dd77a_388 and earlier, except 3975.3977.v478dd9e956c3, does not check whether the main (Jenkinsfile) script for a rebuilt build is approved.

    This allows attackers with Item/Build permission to rebuild a previous build whose (Jenkinsfile) script is no longer approved.

    NOTE: This does not apply to builds whose (Jenkinsfile) script was never approved, but only to builds whose (Jenkinsfile) script got its approval revoked.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3993.v3e20a_37282f8 refuses to rebuild a build whose main (Jenkinsfile) script is unapproved.
  plugins:
  - name: workflow-cps

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.2214.vb_b_34b_2ea_9b_83 and earlier does not check whether the main (Jenkinsfile) script used to restart a build from a specific stage is approved.

    This allows attackers with Item/Build permission to restart a previous build whose (Jenkinsfile) script is no longer approved.

    NOTE: This does not apply to builds whose (Jenkinsfile) script was never approved, but only to builds whose (Jenkinsfile) script got its approval revoked.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.2218.v56d0cda_37c72 refuses to restart a build whose main (Jenkinsfile) script is unapproved.

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2024-52552
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.7.2 and earlier evaluates a string containing the job name with JavaScript on the Authorization view.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.8.0 no longer evaluates a string containing the job name with JavaScript on the Authorization view.
  plugins:
  - name: authorize-project
    previous: 1.7.2

  title: Session fixation vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2024-52553

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 4.418.vccc7061f5b_6d and earlier does not invalidate the existing session on login.

    This allows attackers to use social engineering techniques to gain administrator access to Jenkins.

    PLUGIN_NAME 4.421.v5422614eb_e0a_ invalidates the existing session on login.
  plugins:
  - name: oic-auth

  title: XXE vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2022-46751

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.01 and earlier bundles versions of Apache Ivy vulnerable to CVE-2022-46751.

    This allows attackers able to control the input files for the "IvyTrigger - Poll with an Ivy script" build trigger to have Jenkins parse a crafted XML document that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.02 updates the bundled Apache Ivy version to 2.5.2, which is unaffected by this issue.
  plugins:
  - name: ivytrigger
    previous: '1.01'
    fixed: '1.02'

  title: Script security sandbox bypass vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2024-52554

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 17.v786074c9fce7 and earlier declares folder-scoped library overrides as trusted, so that they're not executed in the Script Security sandbox.

    This allows attackers with Item/Configure permission on a folder to configure a folder-scoped library override that runs without sandbox protection.

    PLUGIN_NAME 19.v3a_c975738d4a_ declares folder-scoped library overrides as untrusted, so that they're executed in the Script Security sandbox.
  plugins:
  - name: shared-library-version-override
    previous: 17.v786074c9fce7
    fixed: 19.v3a_c975738d4a_
