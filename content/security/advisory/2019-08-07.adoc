  title: PLUGIN_NAME failed to mask secrets in system log messages
  cve: CVE-2019-10367
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME logs the changes it applies to the Jenkins system log.
    Secrets such as passwords should be masked (i.e. replaced with asterisks) in that log to prevent accidental disclosure.
    PLUGIN_NAME inspects the type and looks for a field, getter, or constructor argument corresponding to the property, making the secret detection much more robust for the purpose of log message masking.
    This was implemented in the link:https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-07-31/#SECURITY-1279[fix for SECURITY-1279 in the 2019-07-31 security advisory].

    That fix was incomplete and did not cover a log message written to the logger `io.jenkins.plugins.casc.impl.configurators.DataBoundConfigurator`.

    PLUGIN_NAME now uses the same secret detection for these log messages.

    As a workaround, administrators can configure the logging level of the logger `io.jenkins.plugins.casc.impl.configurators.DataBoundConfigurator` to a level that does not include these messages.
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.25 and earlier logs these messages at the `INFO` level, PLUGIN_NAME 1.26 logs them at `FINE`.
    See https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Logging[the logging documentation] for details.

  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in PLUGIN_NAME allowed capturing credentials
  cve: CVE-2019-10368 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10369 (permission check)
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
    This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

    Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

    This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission.

  title: PLUGIN_NAME shows plain text passwords in global configuration form fields
  cve: CVE-2019-10370
  cvss:
    severity: Low
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME allows specifying passwords to be provided to builds in the global Jenkins configuration.

    While the passwords are stored encrypted on disk, they are transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form.
    This can result in exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME does not invalidate the previous session and create a new one upon successful login.
    This allows attackers able to control or obtain another user's pre-login session ID to impersonate them.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME records the HTTP `Referer` header when the authentication process starts and redirects users to that URL when the user has finished logging in.

    This implements an open redirect, allowing malicious sites to implement a phishing attack, with users expecting they have just logged in to Jenkins.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME does not properly escape variables in views, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by users with permission to configure build pipelines.

    This vulnerability is only exploitable on Jenkins releases older than 2.146 or 2.138.2 due to the https://jenkins.io/blog/2018/10/10/security-updates/[security hardening implemented in those releases].

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME uses the PegDown library to implement support for rendering Markdown formatted descriptions in Jenkins.
    It advertises disabling of HTML to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) as a feature.

    PLUGIN_NAME does not prevent the use of `javascript:` scheme in URLs for links.
    This results in an XSS vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure entities with descriptions or similar properties that are rendered by the configured markup formatter.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

    PLUGIN_NAME defines a custom list of pre-approved signatures for scripts protected by the Script Security sandbox.
