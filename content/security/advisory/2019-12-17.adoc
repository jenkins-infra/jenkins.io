  title: XXE vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2019-16549 (XXE), CVE-2019-16550 (CSRF)

    PLUGIN_NAME retrieves XML from Nexus repository manager APIs.
    PLUGIN_NAME 0.16.1 and earlier does not configure the XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.
    While Jenkins users without Overall/Administer permission are not allowed to configure a custom Nexus URL, this could still be exploited via man-in-the-middle attacks, especially if it's not an HTTPS URL.

    Additionally, a connection test form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.
    Combined, these two vulnerabilities allow attackers to have Jenkins parse crafted XML documents that use external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins master, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.16.2 configures its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.
    It also now requires that requests to the connection test form validation method are done via POST, which protects from cross-site request forgery attacks.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.30.1 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods performing form validation.
    This allows users with Overall/Read access to perform connection tests, connecting to an HTTP URL or SSH server using attacker-specified credentials, or determine whether files with an attacker-specified path exist on the Jenkins master file system.

    Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.30.2 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation methods.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.24.1 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method performing form validation.
    This allows users with Overall/Read access to supply a computationally expensive regular expression that will hang the request handling thread.

    Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.24.2 requires POST requests and implements a permission check for the affected form validation methods so that only authorized users are able to submit regular expressions.

    Additionally, the regular expression is implemented in an interruptible way, so that unintentionally expensive regular expression processing can be interrupted.
