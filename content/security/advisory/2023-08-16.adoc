  title: CSRF vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME may approve unsandboxed scripts
  cve: CVE-2023-40336

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 6.846.v23698686f0f6 and earlier does not require POST requests for an HTTP endpoint, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    This vulnerability allows attackers to copy an item, which could potentially automatically approve unsandboxed scripts and allow the execution of unsafe scripts.

    NOTE: An improvement added in Script Security Plugin 1265.va_fb_290b_4b_d34 and 1251.1253.v4e638b_e3b_221 prevents automatic approval of unsandboxed scripts when administrators copy jobs, significantly reducing the impact of this vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 6.848.ve3b_fd7839a_81 requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoint.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.27.5 and earlier does not require POST requests for an HTTP endpoint, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    This vulnerability allows attackers to connect to an attacker-specified URL, capturing GitHub credentials associated with an attacker-specified job.

    This issue is due to an incomplete fix of link:/security/advisory/2022-05-17/#SECURITY-2502[SECURITY-2502].

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.27.5.1 uses the configured SCM URL, instead of a user-specified URL provided as a parameter to the HTTP endpoint.

    PLUGIN_NAME 22.1.38 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

    Additionally, these HTTP endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 22.2.39 requires POST requests and the appropriate permissions for the affected HTTP endpoints.

    PLUGIN_NAME 22.1.38 and earlier does not escape the error message for a form validation method.
    This results in an HTML injection vulnerability.

    NOTE: Since Jenkins 2.275 and LTS 2.263.2, a link:/doc/upgrade-guide/2.263/#formvalidation[security hardening] for form validation responses prevents JavaScript execution, so no scripts can be injected.

    PLUGIN_NAME 22.2.39 removes HTML tags from the error message.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.2.2 and earlier does not escape JUnit test contents when showing them on the Jenkins UI.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.0.2 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.
    Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

    An enumeration of credentials IDs in PLUGIN_NAME 3.0.3 requires the appropriate permissions.

    PLUGIN_NAME provides a webhook endpoint at `/gogs-webhook` that can be used to trigger builds of jobs.
    In PLUGIN_NAME 1.0.15 and earlier, an option to specify a Gogs secret for this webhook is provided, but not enabled by default.

    This allows unauthenticated attackers to trigger builds of jobs corresponding to the attacker-specified job name.

    Additionally, the output of the webhook endpoint includes whether a job corresponding to the attacker-specified job name exists, even if the attacker has no permission to access it.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
