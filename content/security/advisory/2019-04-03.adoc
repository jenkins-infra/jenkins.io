    A missing permission check in a form validation method in PLUGIN_NAME allowed users with Overall/Read permission to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server with attacker-specified API token.

    Additionally, the form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

    The form validation method now performs a permission check for Overall/Administer and requires that requests be sent via POST.
