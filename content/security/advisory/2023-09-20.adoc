  title: Builds can be filtered by values of sensitive build variables
  cve: CVE-2023-43494
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    Jenkins allows filtering builds in the build history widget by specifying an expression that searches for matching builds by name, description, parameter values, etc.

    Jenkins 2.50 through 2.423 (both inclusive), LTS 2.60.1 through 2.414.1 (both inclusive) does not exclude sensitive build variables (e.g., password parameter values) from this search.

    This allows attackers with Item/Read permission to obtain values of sensitive variables used in builds by iteratively testing different characters until the correct sequence is discovered.

    Jenkins 2.424, LTS 2.414.2 excludes sensitive variables from this search.

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability
  cve: CVE-2023-43495
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    `ExpandableDetailsNote` allows annotating build log content with additional information that can be revealed when interacted with.

    Jenkins 2.423 and earlier, LTS 2.414.1 and earlier does not escape the value of the `caption` constructor parameter of `ExpandableDetailsNote`.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to provide `caption` parameter values.

    NOTE: As of publication, the related API is not used within Jenkins (core), and the Jenkins security team is not aware of any affected plugins.

    Jenkins 2.424, LTS 2.414.2 escapes `caption` constructor parameter values.

  title: Temporary plugin file created with insecure permissions
  cve: CVE-2023-43496
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    Jenkins creates a temporary file when a plugin is deployed directly from a URL.

    Jenkins 2.423 and earlier, LTS 2.414.1 and earlier creates this temporary file in the system temporary directory with the default permissions for newly created files.

    If these permissions are overly permissive, they may allow attackers with access to the Jenkins controller file system to read and write the file before it is installed in Jenkins, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution.

    IMPORTANT: This vulnerability only affects operating systems using a shared temporary directory for all users (typically Linux).
    Additionally, the default permissions for newly created files generally only allow attackers to read the temporary file, but not write to it.

    NOTE: This issue complements link:/security/advisory/2023-03-08/#SECURITY-2823[SECURITY-2823], which affected plugins uploaded from an administrator's computer.

    Jenkins 2.424, LTS 2.414.2 creates the temporary file in a subdirectory with more restrictive permissions.

    As a workaround, you can change your default temporary-file directory using the Java system property `java.io.tmpdir`, if you're concerned about this issue but unable to immediately update Jenkins.

  title: Temporary uploaded file created with insecure permissions
  cve: CVE-2023-43497 (Stapler), CVE-2023-43498 (MultipartFormDataParser)
  cvss:
    severity: Low
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    In Jenkins 2.423 and earlier, LTS 2.414.1 and earlier, uploaded files processed via the Stapler web framework and the Jenkins API `MultipartFormDataParser` create temporary files in the system temporary directory with the default permissions for newly created files.

    If these permissions are overly permissive, attackers with access to the system temporary directory may be able to read and write the file before it is used.

    IMPORTANT: This vulnerability only affects operating systems using a shared temporary directory for all users (typically Linux).
    Additionally, the default permissions for newly created files generally only allow attackers to read the temporary file, but not write to it.

    Jenkins 2.424, LTS 2.414.2 creates the temporary files in a subdirectory with more restrictive permissions.

    As a workaround, you can change your default temporary-file directory using the Java system property `java.io.tmpdir`, if you're concerned about this issue but unable to immediately update Jenkins.

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-43499
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.4.1 and earlier does not escape Failure Cause names in build logs.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to create or update Failure Causes.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.4.2 escapes Failure Cause names in build logs.

  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in PLUGIN_NAME allow SSRF
  cve: CVE-2023-43500 (CSRF), CVE-2023-43501 (missing permission check)
  cvss:
    severity: Medium

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.4.1 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a connection test HTTP endpoint.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified hostname and port using attacker-specified username and password.

    Additionally, this HTTP endpoint does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.4.2 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected HTTP endpoint.
