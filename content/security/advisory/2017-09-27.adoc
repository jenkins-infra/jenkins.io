This advisory announces a vulnerability in Jenkins.

*Updated 2017-09-28*:
Clarified which options are disabled by default.
Clarified that it affects only instances that originally installed 2.80.

== Description

=== Unprotected startup
*JENKINS-47139*

Jenkins 2.80 did not correctly initialize the setup wizard on the first startup.
This resulted in the following security settings not being set to the usual strict default:

* No security realm was defined, and no `admin` user was created whose password was written to the Jenkins log or the `initialAdminPassword` file.
* The authorization strategy remained _Anyone can do anything_ rather than _Logged-in users can do anything_.
* _TCP port for JNLP agents_, usually disabled by default, was open, unless a Java system property controlling it was set.
* _CLI over Remoting_ was enabled.
* _CSRF Protection_ was disabled.
* _Agent â†’ Master Access Control_ was disabled.

Affected instances need to be configured to restrict access.

Jenkins instances upgraded from 2.79 or earlier to 2.80 without completing the setup wizard will no longer show the setup wizard, but are locked and need the initial administrator password to unlock.

== Severity

* JENKINS-47139: link:https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H[high]


== Affected versions

* Jenkins 2.80 only
* Jenkins LTS releases are unaffected


== Fix

* Users who originally installed Jenkins 2.80 should review all the options of the _Configure Global Security_ dialog.
* Users should choose Jenkins 2.81, which contains a fix for this issue, for new installations of Jenkins (weekly line).
