  title: Terrapin SSH vulnerability in Jenkins CLI client
  cve: CVE-2023-48795
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N
  description: |-
    The CLI client (`jenkins-cli.jar`) in Jenkins 2.451 and earlier, LTS 2.440.2 and earlier bundles versions of the Apache MINA SSHD library that are susceptible to https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-48795[CVE-2023-48795] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrapin_attack[Terrapin attack]).
    This vulnerability allows a machine-in-the-middle attacker to reduce the security of an SSH connection.

    NOTE: This only affects the Jenkins CLI client when using the `-ssh` connection mode, which is not the default.

    The CLI client (`jenkins-cli.jar`) in Jenkins 2.452, LTS 2.440.3 bundles version 2.12.1 of the Apache MINA SSHD library, which is unaffected by this issue.
