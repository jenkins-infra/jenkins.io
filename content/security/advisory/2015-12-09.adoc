This advisory announces multiple vulnerabilities in Jenkins.

== Description


=== Stored XSS vulnerability through workspace files and archived artifacts
*SECURITY-95 / CVE-2015-7536*

In certain configurations, low privilege users were able to create e.g. HTML files in workspaces and archived artifacts that could result in XSS when accessed by other users. Jenkins now sends `Content-Security-Policy` headers that enables sandboxing and prohibits script execution by default.

NOTE: If you rely on the previous behavior, or in case of compatibility problems with certain plugins, you can modify the header sent by Jenkins.

=== CSRF vulnerability in some administrative actions
*SECURITY-225 / CVE-2015-7537*

Several administration/configuration related URLs could be accessed using `GET`, which allowed attackers to circumvent CSRF protection.


=== CSRF protection ineffective
*SECURITY-233 / CVE-2015-7538*

Malicious users were able to circumvent CSRF protection on any URL by sending specially crafted `POST` requests.


=== Jenkins plugin manager vulnerable to MITM attacks
*SECURITY-234 / CVE-2015-7539*

While the Jenkins update site data is digitally signed, and the signature verified by Jenkins, Jenkins did not verify the provided SHA-1 checksums for the plugin files referenced in the update site data. This enabled MITM attacks on the plugin manager, resulting in installation of attacker-provided plugins.


== Severity

* SECURITY-95 is considered *link:https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N[medium]* as it allows low-privilege users to perform limited XSS in certain configurations.
* SECURITY-225 is considered *link:https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H[high]* as it allows unprivileged attackers to perform some administrative actions via CSRF.
* SECURITY-233 is considered *link:https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H[high]* as it allows unprivileged attackers to circumvent CSRF protection.
* SECURITY-234 is considered *link:https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H[high]* as it allows attackers able to manipulate the network path between Jenkins and the update site to install and run arbitrary code on Jenkins.

== Affected versions

* All Jenkins main line releases up to and including 1.640
* All Jenkins LTS releases up to and including 1.625.2

== Fix

* Jenkins main line users should update to 1.641
* Jenkins LTS users should update to 1.625.3

These versions include fixes to all the vulnerabilities described above. All prior versions are affected by these vulnerabilities.
