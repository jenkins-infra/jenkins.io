  title: CSRF protection for any URL could be bypassed
  cve: CVE-2020-2160
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    An extension point in Jenkins allows selectively disabling cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection for specific URLs.

    Implementations of that extension point received a different representation of the URL path than the Stapler web framework uses to dispatch requests in Jenkins 2.227 and earlier, LTS 2.204.5 and earlier.
    This discrepancy allowed attackers to craft URLs that would bypass the CSRF protection of any target URL.

    Jenkins now uses the same representation of the URL path to decide whether CSRF protection is needed for a given URL as the Stapler web framework uses.

    NOTE: In case of problems, administrators can disable this security fix by setting the system property `hudson.security.csrf.CrumbFilter.UNPROCESSED_PATHINFO` to `true`.

    NOTE: As an additional safeguard, semicolon (`;`) characters in the path part of a URL are now banned by default.
    Administrators can disable this protection by setting the system property `jenkins.security.SuspiciousRequestFilter.allowSemicolonsInPath` to `true`.

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in label expression validation
  cve: CVE-2020-2161
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    Users with Agent/Configure permissions can define labels for nodes.
    These labels can be referenced in job configurations to restrict where a job can be run.

    In Jenkins 2.227 and earlier, LTS 2.204.5 and earlier, the form validation for label expressions in job configuration forms did not properly escape label names, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to define node labels.

    Jenkins now correctly escapes node labels that are shown in form validation on job configuration pages.

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in file parameters
  cve: CVE-2020-2162
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    Jenkins 2.227 and earlier, LTS 2.204.5 and earlier served files uploaded as file parameters to a build without specifying appropriate `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP headers.
    This resulted in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users with permissions to build a job with file parameters.

    Jenkins now sets `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP headers when serving files uploaded via a file parameter to the same value as used for files in workspaces and archived artifacts not served using the Resource Root URL.

    The system property `hudson.model.DirectoryBrowserSupport.CSP` can be set to override the value of `Content-Security-Policy` headers sent when serving these files.
    This is the same system property used for files in workspaces and archived artifacts unless those are served via the link:/doc/upgrade-guide/2.204/#resource-domain-support[Resource Root URL] and works the same way for file parameters.
    See https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/system-administration/security/configuring-content-security-policy[Configuring Content Security Policy] to learn more.

    NOTE: Even when Jenkins is configured to serve files in workspaces and archived artifacts using the Resource Root URL (introduced in Jenkins 2.200), file parameters are not, and therefore still subject to `Content-Security-Policy` restrictions.

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in list view column headers
  cve: CVE-2020-2163
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    Jenkins 2.227 and earlier, LTS 2.204.5 and earlier processed HTML embedded in list view column headers.
    This resulted in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to control the content of column headers.

    The following plugins are known to allow users to define column headers:

    * https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings-ng/[Warnings NG]
    * https://plugins.jenkins.io/maven-info/[Maven Info]
    * https://plugins.jenkins.io/link-column/[Link Column]

    Further plugins may also allow users to define column headers.

    Jenkins no longer processes HTML embedded in list view column headers.

  title: Passwords stored in plain text by Artifactory Plugin
  cve: CVE-2020-2164
  cvss:
    severity: Low
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    Artifactory Plugin 3.5.0 and earlier stores its Artifactory server password in plain text in the global configuration file `org.jfrog.hudson.ArtifactoryBuilder.xml`.
    This password can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins master file system.

    Artifactory Plugin 3.6.0 now stores the Artifactory server password encrypted.
    This change is effective once the global configuration is saved the next time.

  title: Passwords transmitted in plain text by PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2165
  cvss:
    severity: Low
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME stores Artifactory server passwords in its global configuration file `org.jfrog.hudson.ArtifactoryBuilder.xml` on the Jenkins master as part of its configuration.

    While the password is stored encrypted on disk since PLUGIN_NAME 3.6.0, it is transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form by PLUGIN_NAME 3.6.0 and earlier.
    This can result in exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.6.1 transmits the password in its global configuration encrypted.

  - name: artifactory

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.40 and earlier does not configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types.
    This results in a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to provide YAML input files to PLUGIN_NAME's build steps.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.41 configures its YAML parser to only instantiate safe types.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.0.2 configures its YAML parser to only instantiate safe types.

  title: Reflected XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME

  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    A form validation HTTP endpoint in PLUGIN_NAME 1.3 and earlier does not escape a query parameter displayed in an error message.
    This results in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS).

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.4 correctly escapes the query parameter.

    PLUGIN_NAME 4.2 and earlier does not escape package names in its displayed table of packages obtained from a remote server.
    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure jobs.

    PLUGIN_NAME 4.2.1 escapes package names.

  title: XXE vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2171
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 4.2 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

    This allows a user able to control the input files for the 'RapidDeploy deployment package build' build or post-build step to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins master, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

    PLUGIN_NAME 4.2.1 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.
  plugins:
  - name: rapiddeploy-jenkins
    previous: '4.2'
    fixed: 4.2.1
