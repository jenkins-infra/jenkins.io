  title: Sandbox bypass vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-24422
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME provides a sandbox feature that allows low privileged users to define scripts, including Pipelines, that are generally safe to execute.
    Calls to code defined inside a sandboxed script are intercepted, and various allowlists are checked to determine whether the call is to be allowed.

    In PLUGIN_NAME 1228.vd93135a_2fb_25 and earlier, property assignments performed implicitly by the Groovy language runtime when invoking map constructors were not intercepted by the sandbox.

    This vulnerability allows attackers with permission to define and run sandboxed scripts, including Pipelines, to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1229.v4880b_b_e905a_6 intercepts property assignments when invoking map constructors.

    NOTE: As part of this fix, map constructors may only be invoked in the sandbox using the `new` keyword. Attempting to invoke a map constructor using a Groovy cast will fail unconditionally. For example, code such as `[key: value] as MyClass` or `MyClass mc = [key: value]` must be converted to use `new MyClass(key: value)` instead.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME defines a controller/agent message that processes a given file as XML and its XML parser is not configured to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.14 and earlier does not restrict execution of the controller/agent message to agents, and implements no limitations about the file path that can be parsed.
    This allows attackers able to control agent processes to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

    This is due to an incomplete fix of link:/security/advisory/2022-03-15/#SECURITY-2124[SECURITY-2124].

    NOTE: This vulnerability is only exploitable in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier.
    See the link:/doc/upgrade-guide/2.303/#upgrading-to-jenkins-lts-2-303-3[LTS upgrade guide].

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.15 does not allow the affected controller/agent message to be submitted by agents for execution on the controller.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.14 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

    This allows attackers able to control the contents of the version file for the 'Determine Semantic Version' build step to have agent processes parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins agent or server-side request forgery.

    NOTE: Because Jenkins agent processes usually execute build tools whose input (source code, build scripts, etc.) is controlled externally, this vulnerability only has a real impact in very narrow circumstances: when attackers can control XML files, but are unable to change build steps, Jenkinsfiles, test code that gets executed on the agents, or similar.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.15 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.

    Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
