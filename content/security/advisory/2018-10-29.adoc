  description: |
    The Groovy Sandbox library used by Script Security Plugin and Pipeline Groovy Plugin did not apply sandbox restrictions to finalize methods.
    This could be used to invoke arbitrary constructors and methods, bypassing sandbox protection.

    Finalize methods are now prohibited in classes subject to sandbox security.

    NOTE: This may result in existing sandboxed scripts, such as pipelines, starting to fail if they use this language feature.
