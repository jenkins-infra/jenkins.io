  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check allowed changing default graph configuration in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2019-10307 (CSRF) and CVE-2019-10308 (permission check)
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME has the capability to allow other plugins to display trend graphs for their static analysis results.
    PLUGIN_NAME provides the configuration form for the default settings of each graph.

    The configuration form and form submission handler did not perform a permission check, allowing attackers with Job/Read access to change the per-job graph configuration defaults for all users.

    Additionally, the form submission handler did not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME now requires Job/Configure permission and POST requests to configure the per-job graph defaults for all users.

  title: PLUGIN_NAME globally and unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation
  cve: CVE-2019-10317
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation for the entire Jenkins master JVM.

    PLUGIN_NAME no longer does that.
    Instead, it now has an opt-in option to ignore SSL/TLS errors for each site check individually.

  title: XXE vulnerability via UDP broadcast response in PLUGIN_NAME client
  cve: CVE-2019-10309
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:L
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME allows clients to auto-discover Jenkins instances on the same network through a UDP discovery request.
    Responses to this request are XML documents.

    PLUGIN_NAME does not configure the XML parser in a way that would prevent XML External Entity (XXE) processing.
    This allows unauthenticated attackers on the same network to have Swarm clients parse a maliciously crafted XML response that uses external entities to read arbitrary files from the Swarm client or denial-of-service attacks.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in PLUGIN_NAME allowed capturing credentials
  cve: CVE-2019-10310 (CSRF) and CVE-2019-10311 (permission check)
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N # because the second part exists
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
    This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

    Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

    This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions.

  title: Users with Overall/Read access are able to enumerate credential IDs in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2019-10312
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

    This functionality did not check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
    Those could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

    An enumeration of credentials IDs in this plugin now requires Overall/Administer permission.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME stored the client secret unencrypted in the global `config.xml` configuration file on the Jenkins master.
    These credentials could be viewed by users with access to the master file system.

    PLUGIN_NAME now stores the client secret encrypted.

  title: CSRF vulnerability in OAuth callback in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2019-10315
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME did not manage the state parameter of OAuth to prevent CSRF.
    This allowed an attacker to catch the redirect URL provided during the authentication process using OAuth and send it to the victim.
    If the victim was already connected to Jenkins, their Jenkins account would be attached to the attacker's GitHub account.

    The state parameter is now correctly managed.
