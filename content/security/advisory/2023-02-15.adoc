  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-25761

    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1166.va_436e268e972 and earlier does not escape test case class names in JavaScript expressions.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control test case class names in the JUnit resources processed by the plugin.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1166.1168.vd6b_8042a_06de escapes affected test case class names in JavaScript expressions.
  plugins:
  - name: junit

  title: XSS vulnerability in bundled email templates in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-25763
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME bundled multiple preconfigured templates for notification emails.
    The Email Template Testing feature can be used to see what these and other templates would look like based on a given build.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.93 and earlier does not escape various fields included in those email templates, like build display name, user display name, and the names of tests.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control affected fields.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.93.1 escapes affected fields in bundled email templates.
  plugins:
  - name: email-ext
    previous: '2.93'
    fixed: 2.93.1

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in custom email templates in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-25764
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME allows defining custom email templates using https://plugins.jenkins.io/config-file-provider/[Config File Provider plugin] as Jelly or Groovy files.
    The Email Template Testing feature can be used to see what these templates would look like based on a given build by specifying the `managed:` name prefix.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.93 and earlier does not escape, sanitize, or sandbox rendered email template output or log output generated during template rendering.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to create or change custom email templates.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.93.1 renders email template previews inside a sandboxed iframe.
  plugins:
  - name: email-ext
    previous: '2.93'
    fixed: 2.93.1

  title: Script Security sandbox bypass vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-25765
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME allows defining custom email templates using https://plugins.jenkins.io/config-file-provider/[Config File Provider plugin] as Jelly or Groovy files.
    When defined inside a https://plugins.jenkins.io/cloudbees-folder/[folder], email templates need to be subject to Script Security protection (sandboxed execution or full-script approval).

    In PLUGIN_NAME 2.93 and earlier, templates defined inside a folder were not subject to Script Security protection.

    This vulnerability allows attackers able to define email templates in folders to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.

    Email templates defined in folders are subject to sandbox protection in PLUGIN_NAME 2.93.1.
  plugins:
  - name: email-ext
    previous: '2.93'
    fixed: 2.93.1

  title: Missing permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME allow enumerating credentials IDs
  cve: CVE-2023-25766
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 253.v887e0f9e898b and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

    An enumeration of credentials IDs in PLUGIN_NAME 254.v64da_8176c83a requires Overall/Administer permission.
  plugins:
  - name: azure-credentials
    previous: 253.v887e0f9e898b

  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-25767 (CSRF), CVE-2023-25768 (missing permission check)
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 253.v887e0f9e898b and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods implementing form validation.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified web server.

    Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    These form validation methods require POST requests and Overall/Administer permission in PLUGIN_NAME 254.v64da_8176c83a.
  plugins:
  - name: azure-credentials
    previous: 253.v887e0f9e898b

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.0.2 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.
    Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

    An enumeration of credentials IDs in PLUGIN_NAME 3.0.3 requires the appropriate permissions.

  - name: synopsys-coverity
    previous: 3.0.2

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.0.2 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified HTTP server using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

    Additionally, these HTTP endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.0.3 requires POST requests and the appropriate permissions for the affected HTTP endpoints.
  plugins:
  - name: synopsys-coverity
    previous: 3.0.2
    fixed: 3.0.3
