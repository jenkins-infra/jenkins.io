  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME allowed capturing credentials
  cve: CVE-2019-10300 (CSRF) and CVE-2019-10301 (permission check)
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
    This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

    Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

    This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME stored credentials unencrypted in its global configuration file `hudson.plugins.jira.JiraProjectProperty.xml` on the Jenkins master.
    These credentials could be viewed by users with access to the master file system.

    PLUGIN_NAME now stores credentials encrypted.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME stored the service management certificate unencrypted in `credentials.xml` on the Jenkins master.
    These credentials could be viewed by users with access to the master file system.

    PLUGIN_NAME has been deprecated.
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.5 no longer provides any user features and we recommend the plugin be uninstalled.

  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2019-10304 (CSRF) and CVE-2019-10305 (permission check)
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    A missing permission check in a form validation method in PLUGIN_NAME allows users with Overall/Read permission to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server with attacker-specified credentials.

    Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

  title: Sandbox bypass in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2019-10306
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME supports sandboxed Groovy expressions.
    Its sandbox protection could be circumvented during parsing, compilation, and script instantiation by providing a crafted Groovy script.

    This allowed users able to control the pluginâ€™s job-specific configuration to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins master.

    PLUGIN_NAME now uses Script Security APIs that apply sandbox protection during these phases.
