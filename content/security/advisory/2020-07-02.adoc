  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2201
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 3.0.0 and earlier does not escape the file path for the Log file field form validation.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited by users with Job/Configure permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.0.1 escapes the affected part of the error message.

  title: Users with Overall/Read access could enumerate credentials IDs in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2202
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME provides a list of applicable credentials IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

    This functionality does not correctly check permissions in PLUGIN_NAME 6.0.0 and earlier, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
    Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

    An enumeration of credentials IDs in PLUGIN_NAME 6.0.1 now requires the appropriate permissions.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 5.0.1 and earlier does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
    This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to the globally configured Fortify on Demand endpoint using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method.

    Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    This form validation method requires appropriate permission in PLUGIN_NAME 6.0.0.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.25 and earlier does not escape a tool path in the `checkVncServ` form validation endpoint accessed e.g. via job configuration forms.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by Jenkins administrators.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.35 escapes the tool path.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.25 and earlier does not escape a parameter value in the `checkVncServ` form validation endpoint output.

    This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.7 and earlier stores a secret unencrypted in job `config.xml` files as part of its configuration.
    This secret can be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.4.1 and earlier stores a password unencrypted in job `config.xml` files as part of its configuration.
    This password can be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

  title: Passwords transmitted in plain text by PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2210
  cvss:
    severity: Low
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME stores Stash API passwords in its global configuration file `org.jenkinsci.plugins.StashBranchParameter.StashBranchParameterDefinition.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

    While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form by PLUGIN_NAME 0.3.0 and earlier.
    This can result in exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

    This only affects Jenkins before 2.236, including 2.235.x LTS, as Jenkins 2.236 introduces a security hardening that transparently encrypts and decrypts data used for a Jenkins password form field.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.3 and earlier does not configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types.
    This results in a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to provide YAML input files to PLUGIN_NAME's build step.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

    PLUGIN_NAME 19.1.1 and earlier stores credentials in plain text as part of its global configuration file `org.whitesource.jenkins.pipeline.WhiteSourcePipelineStep.xml` and job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller.
    These credentials could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission (in the case of job `config.xml` files) or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

  title: Content-Security-Policy protection for user content disabled by PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2214
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    Jenkins sets the `Content-Security-Policy` header to static files served by Jenkins (specifically `DirectoryBrowserSupport`), such as workspaces, `/userContent`, or archived artifacts.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.9 and earlier globally disables the `Content-Security-Policy` header for static files served by Jenkins.
    This allows cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by users with the ability to control files in workspaces, archived artifacts, etc.

    Jenkins instances with link:/doc/upgrade-guide/2.204/#resource-domain-support[Resource Root URL] configured are largely unaffected.
    A possible exception are file parameter downloads.
    The behavior of those depends on the specific version of Jenkins:

    * Jenkins 2.231 and newer, including 2.235.x LTS, is unaffected, as all resource files from user content are generally served safely from a different domain, without restrictions from `Content-Security-Policy` header.
    * Jenkins between 2.228 (inclusive) and 2.230 (inclusive), as well as all releases of Jenkins 2.222.x LTS and the 2.204.6 LTS release, are affected by this vulnerability, as file parameters are not served via the Resource Root URL.
    * Jenkins 2.227 and older, 2.204.5 and older, don't have XSS protection for file parameter values, see link:/security/advisory/2020-03-25/#SECURITY-1793[SECURITY-1793].

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.5 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.
    This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified host using attacker-specified username and password.

    Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.0 and earlier does not escape the content coming from the MongoDB in the `testConnection` form validation endpoint.
    This allows attackers able to update the configured document in MongoDB to inject the payload.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME allows users with View/Configure permission to add a new column to list views that contains a user-configurable link.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.0 and earlier does not filter the URL for these links, allowing the `javascript:` scheme.
    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure list views.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
