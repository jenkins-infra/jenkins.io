  title: Missing hostname verification in PLUGIN_NAME

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 3.11.0 and earlier does not perform SSH host key verification when connecting to Git repositories via SSH.

    This lack of verification could be abused using a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept these connections.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.11.1 provides strategies for performing host key verification for administrators to select the one that meets their security needs.
    For more information see https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-client-plugin#ssh-host-key-verification[the plugin documentation].

  title: Lack of authentication mechanism in PLUGIN_NAME webhook

    disclosure)

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME provides a webhook endpoint at `/git/notifyCommit` that can be used to notify Jenkins of changes to an SCM repository.
    For its most basic functionality, this endpoint receives a repository URL, and Jenkins will schedule polling for all jobs configured with the specified repository.
    In PLUGIN_NAME 4.11.3 and earlier, this endpoint can be accessed with GET requests and without authentication.

    In addition to this basic functionality, the endpoint also accept a `sha1` parameter specifying a commit ID.
    If this parameter is specified, jobs configured with the specified repo will be triggered immediately, and the build will check out the specified commit.

    Additionally, the output of the webhook endpoint will provide information about which jobs were triggered or scheduled for polling, including jobs the user has no permission to access.

    This allows attackers with knowledge of Git repository URLs to trigger builds of jobs using a specified Git repository and to cause them to check out an attacker-specified commit, and to obtain information about the existence of jobs configured with this Git repository.

    Additionally, this webhook endpoint does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 4.11.4 requires a `token` parameter that authorizes requests to the webhook endpoint.
    While GET requests remain allowed, attackers would need to be able to provide a webhook token.
    For more information see https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-plugin/#push-notification-from-repository[the plugin documentation].

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to check for the existence of an attacker-specified file path on the Jenkins controller file system.
    A sequence of requests can be used to effectively list the Jenkins controller file system.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
