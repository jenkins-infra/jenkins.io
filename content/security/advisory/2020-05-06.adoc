  title: Secrets are not masked by PLUGIN_NAME in builds without build steps
  cve: CVE-2020-2181

    severity: Medium

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.22 and earlier does not mask (i.e., replace with asterisks) secrets in the build log when the build contains no build steps.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.23 now masks secrets when the build contains no build steps.

  title: Improper masking of some secrets in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2182
  cvss:
    severity: Low
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME allows specifying passwords and other secrets as environment variables, and will hide them from console output in builds.
    As a side effect of the fix for link:/security/advisory/2018-02-05/#credentials-binding[SECURITY-698], `$` characters in secrets are escaped to `$$`.
    This will then be expanded to `$` again once the secret is passed to (post) build steps.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.22 and earlier does not mask the escaped form of the secret (containing `$$`).
    This occurs for example in the "Execute Maven top-level targets" build step included in Jenkins.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.23 now masks secrets both in their original form and with escaped `$` characters so they will be masked even if printed before value expansion.

  title: Improper permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2183

    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.43.1 and earlier performs improper permission checks when determining whether a build can copy artifacts from another project build.
    This allows attackers, usually with Job/Configure permission, to configure jobs to copy artifacts from jobs they have no permission to access.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.44 now properly performs permission checks when copying artifacts.
    When updating the plugin from a previous version, the previous behavior is retained ("Migration mode").
    To enable the additional protections, switch to the new "Production mode".
    Doing so may cause existing jobs to fail to copy artifacts.
    For more information see the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/copyartifact-plugin[plugin documentation].

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.15 and earlier does not require POST requests in several HTTP endpoints, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.
    This allows attackers to create and manipulate tags, and to connect to an attacker-specified URL.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.16 now requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoints.

  title: Lack of SSL/TLS certificate and hostname validation in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2187

    PLUGIN_NAME connects to Windows agents via HTTPS.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.50.1 and earlier unconditionally accepts self-signed HTTPS certificates and does not perform hostname validation when connecting to Windows agents.
    This lack of validation could be abused using a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept these connections to build agents.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.50.2 by default no longer accepts self-signed HTTPS certificates and performs hostname validation.
    A new configuration option allows restoring the previous, unsafe behavior.
    For more information see https://github.com/jenkinsci/ec2-plugin/#securing-the-connection-to-windows-amis[the plugin documentation].

  title: Users with Overall/Read access can enumerate credentials IDs in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2188

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME provides a list of applicable credentials IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

    This functionality does not correctly check permissions in PLUGIN_NAME 1.50.1 and earlier, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
    Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

    An enumeration of credentials IDs in PLUGIN_NAME 1.50.2 now requires Overall/Administer permission.

  title: RCE vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 0.2.1 and earlier does not configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types.
    This results in a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure jobs with the filter, or control the contents of a previously configured job's SCM repository.

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.3 configures its YAML parser to only instantiate safe types.

  - name: scm-filter-jervis
