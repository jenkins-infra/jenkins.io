  title: Missing hostname validation in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2252
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.32 and earlier does not perform hostname validation when connecting to the configured SMTP server.
    This lack of validation could be abused using a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept these connections.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.32.1 validates the SMTP hostname when connecting via TLS by default.
    In PLUGIN_NAME 1.32 and earlier, administrators can set the Java system property `mail.smtp.ssl.checkserveridentity` to `true` on startup to enable this protection.

    In case of problems, this protection can be disabled again by setting the Java system property `mail.smtp.ssl.checkserveridentity` to `false` on startup.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.75 and earlier does not perform hostname validation when connecting to the configured SMTP server.
    This lack of validation could be abused using a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept these connections.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.76 validates the SMTP hostname when connecting via TLS by default.
    In PLUGIN_NAME 2.75 and earlier, administrators can set the Java system property `mail.smtp.ssl.checkserveridentity` to `true` on startup to enable this protection.
    Alternatively, this protection can be enabled (or disabled in the new version) via the 'Advanced Email Properties' field in the plugin's configuration in Configure System.

    In case of problems, this protection can be disabled again by setting `mail.smtp.ssl.checkserveridentity` to `false` using either method.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.23.2 and earlier provides an undocumented feature flag, `blueocean.features.GIT_READ_SAVE_TYPE`, that when set to the value `clone` allows an attacker with Item/Configure or Item/Create permission to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.23.3 no longer includes this feature and redirects existing usage to a safer alternative.

    *Updated 2020-09-16:* _This entry previously misidentified the problematic behavior. The HTTP request itself is legitimate, but only authorized users should be able to perform it._

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.23.2 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints implementing connection tests.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.23.3 requires Item/Create permission to perform these connection tests.
