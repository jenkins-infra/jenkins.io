  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21628
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.5 and earlier does not escape parameter names and descriptions.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.5.1 escapes parameter names and descriptions.
  plugins:
  - name: build-with-parameters
    previous: '1.5'
    fixed: 1.5.1
- id: SECURITY-2257

  title: CSRF vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21629
  cvss:
    severity: Low
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.5 and earlier does not require POST requests for its form submission endpoint, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    This vulnerability allows attackers to build a project with attacker-specified parameters.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.5.1 requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoint.
  plugins:
  - name: build-with-parameters
    previous: '1.5'
    fixed: 1.5.1

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21630
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.22 and earlier does not escape parameter values in the build parameters column.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.
    Additionally, a view containing such a job needs to be configured with the build parameters column, or the attacker also needs View/Configure permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.23 escapes parameter values in the build parameters column.
  plugins:
  - name: extra-columns
    previous: '1.22'
    fixed: '1.23'

  title: Missing permission check in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21631
  cvss:
    severity: Low
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 0.26 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission and knowledge of random activity IDs to view related provisioning exception error messages.

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.27 requires Overall/Administer permission to access provisioning exception error messages.
  plugins:
  - name: cloud-stats
    previous: '0.26'
    fixed: '0.27'

  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME allow capturing
    credentials
  cve: CVE-2021-21632 (permission check), CVE-2021-21633 (CSRF)
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 3.1.0 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing "Secret text" credentials stored in Jenkins.
    If no credentials ID is specified, the globally configured credential is used, if set up, and can likewise be captured.

    Additionally, these HTTP endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.1.1 requires POST requests and appropriate permissions for the affected HTTP endpoints.
  plugins:
  - name: dependency-track
    previous: 3.1.0
    fixed: 3.1.1
- id: SECURITY-2162
  reporter: Daniel Beck, CloudBees, Inc.
  title: Passwords stored in plain text by PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21634
  cvss:
    severity: Low
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.41 and earlier stores passwords unencrypted in its global configuration file `hudson.plugins.jabber.im.transport.JabberPublisher.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

    These passwords can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.42 stores passwords encrypted once its configuration is saved again.
  plugins:
  - name: jabber
    previous: '1.41'
    fixed: '1.42'
- id: SECURITY-2261

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21635
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.3.0 and earlier does not escape a parameter name reference in embedded JavaScript.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.3.1 no longer identifies a parameter using user-specified content.
  plugins:
  - name: rest-list-parameter
    previous: 1.3.0
    fixed: 1.3.1

  title: Missing permission check in PLUGIN_NAME allows enumerating credentials IDs
  cve: CVE-2021-21636
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 5.157.1 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.
    Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
