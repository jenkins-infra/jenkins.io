  title: Path traversal allows exploiting XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-41930 (path traversal), CVE-2023-41931 (XSS)
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1227.v7a_79fc4dc01f and earlier does not restrict a `name` query parameter when rendering a history entry.
    This allows attackers to have Jenkins render a manipulated configuration history that was not created by the plugin.

    The history view does not property sanitize or escape the timestamp value from history entries when rendering a history entry.
    This typically isn't a problem, as the value is numeric in genuine history entries.
    Combined with the path traversal vulnerability, this results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with the ability to create a file on the controller (e.g., archived artifacts).

    PLUGIN_NAME 1229.v3039470161a_d restricts the `name` query parameter when rendering a history entry, and escapes the timestamp value from history entries on the history view.

  title: Path traversal allows exploiting XXE vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1227.v7a_79fc4dc01f and earlier does not restrict `timestamp` query parameters in multiple endpoints.
    This allows attackers with Job Config History/DeleteEntry permission to delete attacker-specified directories on the Jenkins controller file system as long as they contain a file called `history.xml`.

    Additionally, PLUGIN_NAME 1227.v7a_79fc4dc01f and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.
    This allows attackers with Item/Configure permission to have Jenkins parse a crafted XML document that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1229.v3039470161a_d restricts `timestamp` query parameters in the affected endpoints, and disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.

    PLUGIN_NAME integrates with https://plugins.jenkins.io/config-file-provider/[Config File Provider] Plugin to specify custom Maven settings, including credentials for authentication.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1330.v18e473854496 and earlier does not properly mask (i.e., replace with asterisks) usernames of credentials specified in custom Maven settings in Pipeline build logs if "Treat username as secret" is checked.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1331.v003efa_fd6e81 masks usernames of credentials specified in custom Maven settings files in Pipeline build logs.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 396.v86ce29279947 and earlier, except 378.380.v545b_1154b_3fb_, does not use a constant-time comparison when checking whether the provided and expected CSRF protection nonce are equal.

    This could potentially allow attackers to use statistical methods to obtain a valid nonce.

    PLUGIN_NAME 397.v907382dd9b_98 uses a constant-time comparison when validating the nonce.

  title: SSRF vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME allows capturing credentials
  cve: CVE-2023-41937
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME provides a webhook endpoint at `/bitbucket-hook/` to receive webhook notifications.

    When acting on these notifications, PLUGIN_NAME 2.4.0 through 2.8.3 (both inclusive) trusts values provided in the webhook payload, including certain URLs, and uses configured Bitbucket credentials to connect to those URLs.
    This allows attackers to capture Bitbucket credentials stored in Jenkins by sending a crafted webhook payload.

    NOTE: Successful exploitation requires that a build is triggered.
    This is the case when the repository has changed since the previous build, or the option "Trigger also if nothing has changed in the repo" is checked.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.8.4 connects to the Bitbucket endpoint configured for the job when acting on a webhook notification.

  title: Incorrect permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.6.2.6 and earlier does not correctly perform a permission check in multiple HTTP endpoints.

    This allows attackers with global Item/Configure permission (while lacking Item/Configure permission on any particular job) to do the following:

    * Enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.
      Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.
    * Connect to an attacker-specified webserver using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.6.2.7 requires global Overall/Administer permission, or Item/Configure permission on a job, to access the affected endpoint.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.5 and earlier bundles versions of Apache Ivy vulnerable to CVE-2022-46751.

    This allows attackers able to control the input file for the "Trigger the build of other projects based on the Ivy dependency management system" post-build step to have Jenkins parse a crafted XML document that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.5 and earlier does not require POST requests for an HTTP endpoint, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.4 and earlier does not verify that permissions configured to be granted are enabled.
    This may allow users formerly granted (typically optional permissions, like Overall/Manage) to access functionality they're no longer entitled to.

    NOTE: As a workaround, administrators can save the permission configuration after disabling a permission, as that will overwrite any permission assignments of disabled permissions.

    The affected features have been removed without replacement in PLUGIN_NAME 1.6.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.0.12 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials IDs of AWS credentials stored in Jenkins.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.0.12 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.0.12 and earlier does not escape the queue name parameter passed to a form validation URL, when rendering an error message.

    This results in an HTML injection vulnerability.

    NOTE: Since Jenkins 2.275 and LTS 2.263.2, a link:/doc/upgrade-guide/2.263/#formvalidation[security hardening] for form validation responses prevents JavaScript execution, so no scripts can be injected.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

    PLUGIN_NAME provides an authorization strategy that defines four levels of access to Jenkins, based on the corresponding permissions in Assembla spaces: ALL, EDIT, VIEW, and NONE.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.14 and earlier does not verify that the permissions it grants are enabled.
    This results in users with EDIT permissions to be granted Overall/Manage and Overall/SystemRead permissions, even if those permissions are disabled and should not be granted.

    NOTE: Additionally, the plugin also grants the deprecated permissions Overall/RunScripts, Overall/UploadPlugins and Overall/ConfigureUpdateCenter to users with EDIT access.
    These permissions allow arbitrary code execution through various means in Jenkins before 2.222.
    Additionally, plugins not yet adapted to the changes in Jenkins 2.222 may also provide access to sensitive features to users with these permissions.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.1 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to do the following:

    * Connect to Frugal Testing using attacker-specified username and password.
    * Retrieve test IDs and names from Frugal Testing, if a valid credential corresponds to the attacker-specified username.

    Additionally, these endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
