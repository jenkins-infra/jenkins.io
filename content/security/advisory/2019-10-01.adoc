  reporter: Nils Emmerich of ERNW Research GmbH
  title: Sandbox bypass vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2019-10431
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    Sandbox protection in PLUGIN_NAME could be circumvented through default parameter expressions in constructors.

    This allowed attackers able to specify and run sandboxed scripts to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.

    These expressions are now subject to sandbox protection.

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2019-10432
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME did not escape the project or build display name shown in the frame HTML page.
    This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the project or build display name, typically users with Job/Configure or Build/Update permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME now escapes the display name displayed in the frame HTML page.

    PLUGIN_NAME stores an LDAP bind password in its global Jenkins configuration.
