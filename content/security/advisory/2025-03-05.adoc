  title: Encrypted values of secrets stored in agent configuration revealed to users
    with Agent/Extended Read permission
  cve: CVE-2025-27622
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    Jenkins 2.499 and earlier, LTS 2.492.1 and earlier does not redact encrypted values of secrets when accessing `config.xml` of agents via REST API or CLI.

    This allows attackers with Agent/Extended Read permission to view encrypted values of secrets.

    NOTE: This issue is related to link:/security/advisory/2016-05-11/#encrypted-secrets-e-g-passwords-were-leaked-to-users-with-permission-to-read-configuration[SECURITY-266 in the 2016-05-11 security advisory].

    Jenkins 2.500, LTS 2.492.2 redacts the encrypted values of secrets stored in agent `config.xml` accessed via REST API or CLI for users lacking Agent/Configure permission.

  title: Encrypted values of secrets stored in view configuration revealed to users
    with View/Read permission
  cve: CVE-2025-27623

  title: CSRF vulnerability
  cve: CVE-2025-27624
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L
  description: |-
    Jenkins 2.499 and earlier, LTS 2.492.1 and earlier does not require POST requests for the HTTP endpoint toggling collapsed/expanded status of sidepanel widgets (e.g., Build Queue and Build Executor Status widgets), resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    This vulnerability allows attackers to have users toggle their collapsed/expanded status of sidepanel widgets.

    Additionally, as the API accepts any string as the identifier of the panel ID to be toggled, attacker-controlled content can be stored in the victim's user profile in Jenkins.

    Jenkins 2.500, LTS 2.492.2 requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoint.

  title: Open redirect vulnerability
  cve: CVE-2025-27625
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    Various features in Jenkins redirect users to partially user-controlled URLs inside Jenkins.
    To prevent open redirect vulnerabilities, Jenkins limits redirections to safe URLs (neither absolute nor scheme-relative/network-path reference).

    In Jenkins 2.499 and earlier, LTS 2.492.1 and earlier, redirects starting with backslash (`\`) characters are considered safe.

    This allows attackers to perform phishing attacks by having users go to a Jenkins URL that will forward them to a different site, because browsers interpret these characters as part of scheme-relative redirects.

    Jenkins 2.500, LTS 2.492.2 considers redirects to URLs starting with backslash (`\`) characters to be unsafe, rejecting such redirects.
