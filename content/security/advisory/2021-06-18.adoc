  title: XXE vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21669
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.72 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

    This allows attackers with the ability to call webhooks configured to extract parameters using XPath to have Jenkins parse a crafted XML request body that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.74 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.
  plugins:
  - name: generic-webhook-trigger
    previous: '1.72'
    fixed: '1.74'
