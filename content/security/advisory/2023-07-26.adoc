  title: Stored XSS vulnerability
  cve: CVE-2023-39151
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    Jenkins applies formatting to the console output of builds, transforming plain URLs into hyperlinks.

    Jenkins 2.415 and earlier, LTS 2.401.2 and earlier does not sanitize or properly encode URLs of these hyperlinks in build logs.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control build log contents.

    Jenkins 2.416, LTS 2.401.3, and LTS 2.414.1 encode URLs of affected hyperlink annotations in build logs.

  title: Incorrect control flow in PLUGIN_NAME breaks credentials masking in the build
    log
  cve: CVE-2023-39152
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.8 improperly invokes APIs available only on the controller from an agent when setting up build log annotations, causing an exception.

    As a result, credentials may not be masked (i.e., replaced with asterisks) in the build log in some circumstances.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.8.1 improves the control flow and handles the exception, so that credentials masking is not affected.

    NOTE: An improvement in https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-api/[Pipeline: API] 1232.v1679fa_2f0f76 prevents issues like this from affecting credentials masking in the future.
    As of the publication of this advisory, the Jenkins security team is not aware of other plugins with a similar issue.

  title: CSRF vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-39153
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.17.1 and earlier does not implement a state parameter in its OAuth flow, a unique and non-guessable value associated with each authentication request.

    This vulnerability allows attackers to trick users into logging in to the attacker's account.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.18 implements a state parameter in its OAuth flow.
  plugins:
  - name: gitlab-oauth
    previous: 1.17.1
    fixed: '1.18'

  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in PLUGIN_NAME allow capturing
    credentials
  cve: CVE-2023-3414 (CSRF), CVE-2023-3442 (missing permission check)
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.38.0 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

    Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.38.1 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation method.

  - name: servicenow-devops
    previous: 1.38.0
    fixed: 1.38.1

  title: Incorrect permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME allow capturing credentials
  cve: CVE-2023-39154
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.0.10 and earlier does not correctly perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

    This allows attackers with global Item/Configure permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.0.11 requires the appropriate permissions for the affected HTTP endpoints.
  plugins:
  - name: qualys-was
    previous: 2.0.10
    fixed: 2.0.11

  title: Secret displayed without masking by PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-39155
  cvss:
    severity: Low
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME stores the user.pem key in its global configuration file `io.chef.jenkins.ChefIdentityBuildWrapper.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

    While this key is stored encrypted on disk, in PLUGIN_NAME 2.0.3 and earlier the global configuration form does not mask the user.pem key form field, increasing the potential for attackers to observe and capture it.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

  title: CSRF vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-39156
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.22 and earlier does not require POST requests for an HTTP endpoint, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    This vulnerability allows attackers to delete previously created Bazaar SCM tags.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
