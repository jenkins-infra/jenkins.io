  title: XXE vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21657
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 0.40 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

    This allows attackers with Job/Configure permission or otherwise able to control the contents of an XML file being polled for changes to have Jenkins parse a crafted XML document that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the polling Jenkins controller or agent, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.41 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.

  title: XXE vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21658

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.0 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.
    This XML parser is used for the "Build on NuGet updates" feature.

    This allows attackers with the ability to control the contents of the `packages.config` file in a workspace to have Jenkins parse a crafted XML document that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.1 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.

  - name: nuget

  title: XXE vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21659

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.48 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

    This allows attackers with Job/Configure permission or otherwise able to control the contents of an URL to an XML document being examined for changes to have Jenkins parse a crafted XML document that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the polling Jenkins controller or agent, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.49 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.
  plugins:
  - name: urltrigger
    previous: '0.48'
    fixed: '0.49'

  title: XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21660
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 0.1.0 and earlier uses a Markdown library to parse Markdown that does not escape crafted link target URLs.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with the ability to edit any description rendered using the configured markup formatter.

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.2.0 uses a different Markdown library that is not affected by this problem.
  plugins:
  - name: markdown-formatter
    previous: 0.1.0
    fixed: 0.2.0
