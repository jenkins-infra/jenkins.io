- id: SECURITY-248
  title: Environment Injector Plugin before 1.91 stored sensitive build variables
  reporter: Jonathan Claudius of Mozilla
  cvss:
    severity: medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  plugins:
    - name: envinject
      fixed: 1.91
      previous: "1.90"
  description: |
    EnvInject plugin stores environment variables in order to visualize them in the "Injected Environment Variables" view.
    Sensitive build variables, typically passwords, are exempt from this behavior.
    Plugin versions older than 1.91 (released on Mar 08, 2015) however did not exempt sensitive variables, and persisted them on disk too.
    Such persisted sensitive variables may be displayed by any release of this plugin for builds run before it was updated to version 1.91 or newer.

    While the bug persisting sensitive build variables has been addressed in release 1.91, there is no fix addressing this problem for historical build data.

    You may be affected by this sensitive data exposure issue if all of the following are true:

    * You define sensitive environment variables globally, per node, or per job.
    * You have ever used Environment Injector Plugin 1.90 or older.
    * You still have build records created while Environment Injector Plugin 1.90 or older was installed and enabled.

    To prevent the further exposure of sensitive build variables, we recommend that you take the following steps if you are affected by this:

    * Disable the visualization of Injected Environment variables in the global configuration.
      After this change the data will be accessible only to those ones who have access to raw build.xml files.
      This is a reversible action that can be applied immediately, and can be reverted once you've purged the data on disk (below).
    * Remove the sensitive data from disk by manually removing corresponding entries from `injectedEnvVars.txt` files, or deleting the `injectedEnvVars.txt` files in old build directories.
    * Rotate all secrets that have potentially been exposed.

  title: Coverity Plugin stored keystore and private key passwords in plain text
  reporter: Steve Marlowe &lt;smarlowe@cisco.com&gt; of Cisco ASIG
  cve: CVE-2018-1000104
  cvss:
    severity: low
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  plugins:
    - name: coverity
      fixed: 1.11.0
      previous: 1.10.0
  description: |
    The Coverity Plugin stored passwords unencrypted as part of its configuration.
    This allowed users with Jenkins master local file system access and Jenkins administrators to retrieve the stored password.
    The latter could result in exposure of the passwords through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

    The Coverity Plugin now integrates with plugin:credentials[Credentials Plugin] to store passwords, and automatically migrates existing passwords.

  title: Improper access control in Gerrit Trigger Plugin allowed unauthorized users to read some server configuration information
  reporter: Daniel Beck, CloudBees, Inc.
  cve: CVE-2018-1000105
  cvss:
    severity: medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  plugins:
    - name: gerrit-trigger
      fixed: 2.27.5
      previous: 2.27.4
  description: |
    Missing permission checks in Gerrit Trigger Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read permission to access a form that showed the configuration of Gerrit servers in Jenkins.
    The key file password was only shown in its encrypted form, if configured.
    Other options were plainly visible.

    The missing permission check has been added.

      fixed: 2.27.5
      previous: 2.27.4
  description: |
    Missing permission checks in Gerrit Trigger Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read permission to perform the following actions:

    - Configure Gerrit servers
    - Connect and disconnect configured Gerrit servers

    The missing permission checks have been added.

  title: Improper access control allowed users without ManageOwnership permission to change job ownership metadata in Job and Node ownership Plugin
  reporter: Oleg Nenashev, CloudBees, Inc.
  cve: CVE-2018-1000107
  cvss:
    severity: medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  plugins:
    - name: ownership
      fixed: 0.12.0
      previous: 0.11.0
  description: |
    Job and Node ownership Plugin did not prevent the ownership metadata being overwritten when a job or node configuration was updated from the CLI or using the remote API (`POST config.xml`).

    This allowed users with Job/Configure permission but without ManageOwnership/Jobs permission to change job ownership metadata, and users with Computer/Configure but without ManageOwnership/Nodes to change node ownership metadata.

    Changes to job or node ownership metadata via remote API now require ManageOwnership/Jobs or ManageOwnership/Nodes permission, respectively.
    Changes to job or node ownership via CLI require Overall/Administer permission.

  title: Azure Slave Plugin bundled outdated httpclient library with denial of service vulnerability
  cve: CVE-2015-5262
  cvss:
    severity: medium
    vector: (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P)
  plugins:
    - name: azure-slave-plugin
      title: Azure Slave
      previous: 0.3.4
  description: |
    The Azure Slave Plugin bundles a version of the httpclient library that is vulnerable to link:https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2015-5262[CVE-2015-5262].

    As the plugin has been deprecated in favor of plugin:azure-vm-agents[Azure VM Agents Plugin] in 2016, there are no plans to release a fix.
    It has been removed from distribution per request by the former maintainers.

  title: Unprivileged users are able to enumerate credential IDs in Google Play Android Publisher Plugin
  reporter: Christopher Orr
  cve: CVE-2018-1000109
  cvss:
    severity: medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  plugins:
    - name: google-play-android-publisher
      fixed: 1.7
      previous: 1.6
  description: |
    Google Play Android Publisher Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring a job to select the one they'd like to use to authenticate with the Google Play API.

    This functionality did not check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credential IDs.
    Those could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

    Additionally, a related form validation function would allow verification whether a specified credential is valid for use with the Google Play API.

    Enumeration of credentials IDs and validation of specified credentials in this plugin now requires the permission to have the ExtendedRead permission (when that permission is enabled; otherwise Configure permission) to the job in whose context credentials are being accessed.

  title: Disclosure of user names and node names to unauthorized users through post-commit hook URL in Git Plugin
  reporter: Spencer Gietzen of Rhino Security Labs
  cve: CVE-2018-1000110
  cvss:
    severity: medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  plugins:
    - name: git
      fixed: 3.8.0
      previous: 3.7.0
  description: |
    The class handling unauthenticated Git post-commit hook notification requests at the `/git/` path unnecessarily extended another type that handled requests to the `…/search/` sub-path.

    This allowed submission of search queries to Jenkins, and getting a list of search results usually available to anyone with Overall/Read permission.
    In current Jenkins releases, those are typically the names of known users (both actual users of Jenkins, and known SCM committers) and nodes (master and agents).

    The class handling requests to `/git/` no longer extends the class handling requests to the `…/search/` sub-path, therefore any such requests will fail.

  title: Promoted Builds Plugin allowed unauthorized users to run some promotion processes
  reporter: Devin Nusbaum, CloudBees, Inc.
  cve: CVE-2018-1000114
  cvss:
    severity: medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  plugins:

      previous: 2.31.1
  description: |
    Users with Job/Read access were able to approve and re-execute promotion processes with a manual promotion condition that did not specify a list of users allowed to manually approve the promotion.

    The plugin now requires users to have the Promotion/Promote permission to be able to approve or re-execute a promotion with manual condition that does not specify a list of users allowed to approve it.

    The following additional changes to permission enforcement were implemented in this update to make condition enforcement consistent for the three actions Approve, Re-Execute, and Force:

    NOTE: Some of these changes allow users to act on some promotions they were not able to act on in 2.x releases of this plugin.

    . Users with just the Promotion/Promote permission are no longer allowed to re-execute or force promotions with a manual condition that specifies a list of users, unless the user is on that list.
    . Administrators are now able to approve any promotion with a manual condition.
    . Users specified in a manual promotion condition are now allowed to force this promotion.
