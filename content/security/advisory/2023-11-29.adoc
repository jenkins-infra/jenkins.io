  title: Exposure of system-scoped credentials in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-49653
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 3.11 and earlier does not set the appropriate context for credentials lookup, allowing the use of system-scoped credentials otherwise reserved for the global configuration.

    This allows attackers with Item/Configure permission to access and capture credentials they are not entitled to.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.12 defines the appropriate context for credentials lookup.

  - name: jira

  title: Incorrect permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-49652
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 4.550.vb_327fca_3db_11 and earlier does not correctly perform permission checks in multiple HTTP endpoints.
    This allows attackers with global Item/Configure permission (while lacking Item/Configure permission on any particular job) to do the following:

    * Enumerate system-scoped credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.
      Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.
    * Connect to Google Cloud Platform using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, to obtain information about existing projects.

    PLUGIN_NAME 4.551.v5a_4dc98f6962 requires Overall/Administer permission for the affected HTTP endpoints.

  title: CSRF vulnerabilities and missing permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME allow XXE
  cve: CVE-2023-49654 (permission checks), CVE-2023-49655 (CSRF), CVE-2023-49656 (XXE)
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME determines whether a user-specified directory on the Jenkins controller is the location of a MATLAB installation by parsing an XML file in that directory.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.11.0 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints implementing related form validation.

    Additionally, these HTTP endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    Additionally, the plugin does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.
    This allows attackers able to create files on the Jenkins controller file system to have Jenkins parse a crafted XML document that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.11.1 configures its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

    Additionally, POST requests and Item/Configure permission are required for the affected HTTP endpoints.

  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-49673 (CSRF), CVE-2023-49674 (missing permission check)

    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.22 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a connection test HTTP endpoint.
    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified hostname and port using attacker-specified username and password.
    Additionally, this HTTP endpoint does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.2 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected HTTP endpoint.
  plugins:
  - name: neuvector-vulnerability-scanner
    previous: '1.22'
    fixed: '2.2'
