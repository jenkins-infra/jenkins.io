  title: Multiple XSS vulnerabilities

    (SECURITY-2776), CVE-2022-34173 (SECURITY-2780)

    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Jenkins 2.355 and earlier, LTS 2.332.3 and earlier allow attackers to inject HTML and JavaScript into the Jenkins UI:

    * SECURITY-2779 (CVE-2022-34170): Since Jenkins 2.320 and LTS 2.332.1, help icon tooltips no longer escape the feature name, effectively undoing the fix for link:/security/advisory/2020-08-12/#SECURITY-1955[SECURITY-1955].
    * SECURITY-2761 (CVE-2022-34171): Since Jenkins 2.321 and LTS 2.332.1, the HTML output generated for new symbol-based SVG icons includes the `title` attribute of `l:ionicon` until Jenkins 2.334 and `alt` attribute of `l:icon` since Jenkins 2.335 without further escaping.
    * SECURITY-2776 (CVE-2022-34172): Since Jenkins 2.340, symbol-based icons unescape previously escaped values of `tooltip` parameters.
    * SECURITY-2780 (CVE-2022-34173): Since Jenkins 2.340, the tooltip of the build button in list views supports HTML without escaping the job display name.

    These vulnerabilities are known to be exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.

    Jenkins 2.356, LTS 2.332.4 and LTS 2.346.1 addresses these vulnerabilities:

    * SECURITY-2779: The feature name in help icon tooltips is now escaped.
    * SECURITY-2761: The `title` attribute of `l:ionicon` (Jenkins LTS 2.332.4) and `alt` attribute of `l:icon` (Jenkins 2.356 and LTS 2.346.1) are escaped in the generated HTML output.
    * SECURITY-2776: Symbol-based icons no longer unescape values of `tooltip` parameters.
    * SECURITY-2780: The tooltip of the build button in list views is now escaped.

    NOTE: No Jenkins LTS release is affected by SECURITY-2776 or SECURITY-2780, as these were not present in Jenkins 2.332.x and fixed in the 2.346.x line before 2.346.1.

  title: Observable timing discrepancy allows determining username validity
  cve: CVE-2022-34174
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    In Jenkins 2.355 and earlier, LTS 2.332.3 and earlier, an observable timing discrepancy on the login form allows distinguishing between login attempts with an invalid username, and login attempts with a valid username and wrong password, when using the Jenkins user database security realm.
    This allows attackers to determine the validity of attacker-specified usernames.

    Login attempts with an invalid username now validate a synthetic password to eliminate the timing discrepancy in Jenkins 2.356, LTS 2.332.4.

  title: Unauthorized view fragment access
  cve: CVE-2022-34175
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    Jenkins uses the Stapler web framework to render its UI views.
    These views are frequently composed of several view fragments, enabling plugins to extend existing views with more content.

    Before link:/security/advisory/2019-07-17/#SECURITY-534[SECURITY-534] was fixed in Jenkins 2.186 and LTS 2.176.2, attackers could in some cases directly access a view fragment containing sensitive information, bypassing any permission checks in the corresponding view.

    In Jenkins 2.335 through 2.355 (both inclusive), the protection added for SECURITY-534 is disabled for some views.
    As a result, attackers could in very limited cases directly access a view fragment containing sensitive information, bypassing any permission checks in the corresponding view.

    NOTE: As of publication, the Jenkins security team is unaware of any vulnerable view fragment across the Jenkins plugin ecosystem.

    Jenkins 2.356 restores the protection for affected views.

    NOTE: No Jenkins LTS release is affected by this issue, as it was not present in Jenkins 2.332.x and fixed in the 2.346.x line before 2.346.1.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1119.va_a_5e9068da_d7 and earlier does not escape descriptions of test results.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Run/Update permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1119.1121.vc43d0fc45561 applies the configured markup formatter to descriptions of test results.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 448.v37cea_9a_10a_70 and earlier allows Pipeline authors to specify `file` parameters for Pipeline `input` steps even though they are unsupported.
    Although the uploaded file is not copied to the workspace, Jenkins archives the file on the controller as part of build metadata using the parameter name without sanitization as a relative path inside a build-related directory.

    This allows attackers able to configure Pipelines to create or replace arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system with attacker-specified content.

    PLUGIN_NAME 449.v77f0e8b_845c4 prohibits use of `file` parameters for Pipeline `input` steps.
    Attempts to use them will fail Pipeline execution.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.0.3 allows specifying a `link` query parameter that build status badges will link to, without restricting possible values.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.0.3 and earlier allows specifying a `style` query parameter that is used to choose a different SVG image style without restricting possible values.

    This results in a relative path traversal vulnerability, allowing attackers without Overall/Read permission to specify paths to other SVG images on the Jenkins controller file system.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.0.4 restricts the `style` query parameter to one of the three legal values.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.0.3 and earlier does not correctly perform the ViewStatus permission check in the HTTP endpoint it provides for "unprotected" status badge access.

    This allows attackers without any permissions to obtain the build status badge icon for any attacker-specified job and/or build.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.0.4 requires ViewStatus permission to obtain the build status badge icon.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.0.8 and earlier implements an agent-to-controller message that creates a user-specified directory if it doesn't exist, and parsing files inside it as test results.

    This allows attackers able to control agent processes to create an arbitrary directory on the Jenkins controller or to obtain test results from existing files in an attacker-specified directory.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.1.0 changes the message type from agent-to-controller to controller-to-agent, preventing execution on the controller.

    Multiple plugins do not escape the name and description of the parameter types they provide:

    * Agent Server Parameter 1.1 and earlier (SECURITY-2731 / CVE-2022-34183)
    * CRX Content Package Deployer 1.9 and earlier (SECURITY-2727 / CVE-2022-34184)

    * Stash Branch Parameter 0.3.0 and earlier (SECURITY-2725 / CVE-2022-34198)

    This results in stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.

    Exploitation of these vulnerabilities requires that parameters are listed on another page, like the "Build With Parameters" and "Parameters" pages provided by Jenkins (core), and that those pages are not hardened to prevent exploitation.
    Jenkins (core) has prevented exploitation of vulnerabilities of this kind on the "Build With Parameters" and "Parameters" pages since 2.44 and LTS 2.32.2 as part of the link:/security/advisory/2017-02-01/#persisted-cross-site-scripting-vulnerability-in-parameter-names-and-descriptions[SECURITY-353 / CVE-2017-2601] fix.
    Additionally, several plugins have previously been updated to list parameters in a way that prevents exploitation by default, see link:/security/advisory/2022-04-12/#SECURITY-2617[SECURITY-2617 in the 2022-04-12 security advisory for a list].

    The following plugins have been updated to escape the name and description of the parameter types they provide in the versions specified:

    * REST List Parameter Plugin 1.6.0
    * Hidden Parameter Plugin 0.0.5

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix available for the following plugins:

    * Agent Server Parameter 1.1 and earlier (SECURITY-2731 / CVE-2022-34183)
    * CRX Content Package Deployer 1.9 and earlier (SECURITY-2727 / CVE-2022-34184)
    * Date Parameter Plugin 0.0.4 and earlier (SECURITY-2711 / CVE-2022-34185)
    * Dynamic Extended Choice Parameter 1.0.1 and earlier (SECURITY-2712 / CVE-2022-34186)
    * Filesystem List Parameter 0.0.7 and earlier (SECURITY-2716 / CVE-2022-34187)
    * Image Tag Parameter 1.10 and earlier (SECURITY-2721 / CVE-2022-34189)
