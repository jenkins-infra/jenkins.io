  title: XXE vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2172
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.1.4 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.
    This allows a user able to control the input files for the "Publish Coverage Report" post-build step to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.1.5 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.
  plugins:
  - name: code-coverage-api
    previous: 1.1.4
    fixed: 1.1.5

  title: XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2173
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.2.7 and earlier serves Gatling reports in a manner that bypasses the `Content-Security-Policy` protection introduced in Jenkins 1.641 and 1.625.3.
    This results in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to change report content.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.3.0 no longer allows viewing Gatling reports directly in Jenkins.
    Instead users need to download an archive containing the report.
  plugins:
  - name: gatling
    previous: 1.2.7
    fixed: 1.3.0

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.3.19 and earlier does not escape various values printed as part of form validation output.

    This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.3.20 escapes the values printed as part of the affected form validation endpoints.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.31 and earlier does not correctly escape report contents before showing them on the Jenkins UI.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to control the XML input files processed by the plugin.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.33 escapes content from XML input files before rendering it on the Jenkins UI.

  - name: fitnesse

  title: XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME

  description: |-
    Multiple form validation endpoints in PLUGIN_NAME 1.4 and earlier do not escape values received from the useMango service.

    This results in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to control the values returned from the useMango service.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.5 escapes all values received from the useMango service in form validation messages.
  plugins:
  - name: usemango-runner
    previous: '1.4'
    fixed: '1.5'
