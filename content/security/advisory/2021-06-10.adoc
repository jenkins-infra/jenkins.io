  title: Missing permission checks allow enumerating credentials IDs in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21661
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.10.0 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.
    Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

    An enumeration of credentials IDs in PLUGIN_NAME 1.10.1 requires the appropriate permissions.

  - name: kubernetes-cli

    PLUGIN_NAME 10.0.1 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

    An enumeration of credentials IDs in PLUGIN_NAME 10.0.2 requires the appropriate permissions.

  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in PLUGIN_NAME allows capturing
    credentials
  cve: CVE-2021-21663 (missing permission check), CVE-2021-21664 (incorrect permission
    check), CVE-2021-21665 (CSRF)
  cvss:
    severity: High

    PLUGIN_NAME 10.0.1 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing Username/password credentials stored in Jenkins.

    Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 10.0.2 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation method.

    NOTE: The permission check was partially fixed in PLUGIN_NAME 7.5.9: A permission check was added, but for the wrong permission, still allowing some non-admin users to access the form validation method.

  - name: deployit-plugin

  title: Reflected XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21666
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.6.0 and earlier does not escape output that can indirectly be controlled through query parameters in an error message for a form validation endpoint.

    This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

    NOTE: Only older releases of Jenkins are affected by this vulnerability. Jenkins 2.275 and newer, LTS 2.263.2 and newer include a protection preventing this from being exploitable.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.6.1 escapes affected parts of the error message in the form validation endpoint.

  - name: kiuwanJenkinsPlugin
