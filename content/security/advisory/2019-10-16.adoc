  title: Arbitrary file read vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2019-10436
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME allowed the creation of credentials based on the content of files on the Jenkins controller through a feature retaining backwards compatibility with earlier plugin releases.
    This allowed users with the permission to configure jobs and credentials to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller by creating a credential referencing an arbitrary file on the Jenkins controller.

    PLUGIN_NAME no longer allows a regular user to create credentials in the legacy format.

  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in PLUGIN_NAME allowed capturing credentials
  cve: CVE-2019-10437 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10438 (permission check)
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
    This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.
    
    Additionally, the form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME now requires POST requests and Item/Configure permission.

  title: Users with Overall/Read access could enumerate credential IDs in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2019-10439
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

    This functionality did not correctly check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
    Those could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

    An enumeration of credentials IDs in PLUGIN_NAME now requires the appropriate permission.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME stored credentials unencrypted in its global configuration file `org.jenkinsci.plugins.neoload.integration.NeoGlobalConfig.xml` and in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller.
    These credentials could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

    PLUGIN_NAME now stores these credentials encrypted.

    PLUGIN_NAME did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
    This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server with attacker-specified access token or username and password.
    
    Additionally, the form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME unconditionally disabled SSL/TLS certificate validation for connections to the HP ALM service.

  cvss:
    severity: Low
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    Missing permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME allowed users with Overall/Read permission to obtain limited information about the scope and access of a credential with an attacker-specified credential ID obtained through another method.

    PLUGIN_NAME now requires Job/Configure permission for these operations.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME unconditionally disabled SSL/TLS certificate validation for the entire Jenkins controller JVM.

    PLUGIN_NAME no longer does that.
    Instead, it now has an opt-in option to ignore SSL/TLS errors for its connections.

  title: Script sandbox bypass vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2019-10458
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME defines a custom list of pre-approved signatures for all scripts protected by the Script Security sandbox.

    This custom list of pre-approved signatures allows the use of methods that can be used to bypass Script Security sandbox protection.
    This results in arbitrary code execution on any Jenkins instance with this plugin installed.

    As of publication of this advisory there is no fix.
