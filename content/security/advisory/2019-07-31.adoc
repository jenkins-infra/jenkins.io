  title: Sandbox bypass through type casts in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2019-10355
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    Sandbox protection in PLUGIN_NAME could be circumvented by casting crafted objects to other types.
    This allowed attackers able to specify sandboxed scripts to invoke constructors that weren't approved.

    Additionally, this could be used to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller.

    Casting collections to other types as an alternative syntax for constructor invocation is now only allowed when the collection type is defined in `java.util`, and prohibited otherwise.
    Casting files and enums to arrays is now intercepted by the sandbox and treated as the invocation of an equivalent method.

    Sandbox protection in PLUGIN_NAME could be circumvented through crafted subexpressions used as arguments to method pointer expressions.
    This allowed attackers able to specify sandboxed scripts to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.

    Method pointer subexpressions are now subject to sandbox protection.

    Missing permission check in PLUGIN_NAME

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME provides form validation to determine whether the revision (e.g. commit, tag, or branch name) specified for a global library exists in the repository.
    This form validation method lacked a permission check, allowing attackers with Overall/Read access to determine whether an attacker-specified revision exists in an SCM repository configured for use in an existing shared library.

    PLUGIN_NAME now performs the appropriate permission check.

  title: PLUGIN_NAME failed to mask secrets in system log messages
  cve: CVE-2019-10343
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME logs the changes it applies to the Jenkins system log.
    Secrets such as passwords should be masked (i.e. replaced with asterisks) in that log to prevent accidental disclosure.

    Between PLUGIN_NAME 0.8-alpha and 1.0, log messages contained values if the values were specified using properties in the YAML file (https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2018-06-25/#SECURITY-929[SECURITY-929]).

    Since PLUGIN_NAME 1.1, log messages in PLUGIN_NAME instead mask values of type `Secret`, which is used in Jenkins to store the values encrypted on disk.
    This did not work in many instances, as plugins could use the jenkinsdoc:Secret[`Secret`] type to store credentials encrypted on disk while not having the `Secret` type appear in their Java API.

    PLUGIN_NAME now inspects the type and looks for a field, getter, or constructor argument corresponding to the property, making the secret detection much more robust for the purpose of log message masking.

    As a workaround, administrators can configure the logging level of the logger `io.jenkins.plugins.casc.Attribute` to a level that does not include `INFO` messages.
    See https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Logging[the logging documentation] for details.

  title: PLUGIN_NAME evaluated variable references when importing a previously exported configuration
  cve: CVE-2019-10362
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME allows exporting the live Jenkins configuration, as well as importing and applying a configuration provided in the same format.
    One of the features of the import is that it allows specifying variable references (e.g. `${VARIABLE_NAME}`) in the configuration YAML file.
    These will be replaced by the value of the corresponding environment variable (or https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin/#handling-secrets[other source of secrets]) during import (interpolation).
    If such a value should not be interpolated, the escape character `^` can be used before (e.g. `^${VARIABLE_NAME}`).

    Exporting did not add `^` escape characters to exported strings, such as various entity descriptions.
    This allowed attackers with permission to configure certain entities, such as credentials or agents, to specify crafted descriptions containing variable references.
    These would be replaced by the corresponding environment variable's value during a subsequent import.

    The export now adds `^` escape characters to exported strings as needed to prevent them from being interpolated during import.
    Previously exported configurations may require manual cleanup by Jenkins admins before being imported.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME allows to export the current Jenkins configuration as a YAML file.
    Secrets such as passwords should be exported in their encrypted form to prevent accidental disclosure.

    PLUGIN_NAME did not reliably detect which values in the exported YAML file need to be considered sensitive (e.g. credentials and other secrets), as plugins could use the jenkinsdoc:Secret[`Secret`] type to store credentials encrypted on disk while not having the `Secret` type appear in their Java API.
    This resulted in credentials being exported in plain text in some cases.

    PLUGIN_NAME now inspects the type and looks for a field, getter, or constructor argument corresponding to the property, making the secret detection much more robust for the purpose of exporting encrypted secrets.
