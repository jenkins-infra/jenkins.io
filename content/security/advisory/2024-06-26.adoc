  title: Exposure of secrets through system log in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2024-39458
  cvss:
    severity: Low
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME provides utility functionality used, e.g., in Pipeline to instantiate and configure build steps, typically before their execution.

    When PLUGIN_NAME 337.v1b_04ea_4df7c8 and earlier fails to configure a build step, it logs a warning message containing diagnostic information that may contain secrets passed as step parameters.

    This can result in accidental exposure of secrets through the default system log.

    PLUGIN_NAME 338.v848422169819 inspects the types of actual parameters before logging these warning messages, and limits detailed diagnostic information to FINE level log messages if secrets are involved.
    These log messages are not displayed in the default Jenkins system log.

  title: Secret file credentials stored unencrypted in rare cases by PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2024-39459
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    When creating secret file credentials PLUGIN_NAME 182.v468b_97b_9dcb_8 and earlier attempts to decrypt the content of the file to check if it constitutes a valid encrypted secret.
    In rare cases the file content matches the expected format of an encrypted secret, and the file content will be stored unencrypted (only Base64 encoded) on the Jenkins controller file system.

    These credentials can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system (global credentials) or with Item/Extended Read permission (folder-scoped credentials).

    NOTE: Secret file credentials stored unencrypted are unusable, as they would be decrypted during their use.
    Any successfully used secret file credentials are therefore unaffected.

    PLUGIN_NAME 183.va_de8f1dd5a_2b_ no longer attempts to decrypt the content of the file when creating secret file credentials.

  title: Bitbucket OAuth access token exposed in the build log by PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2024-39460
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 886.v44cf5e4ecec5 and earlier prints the Bitbucket OAuth access token as part of the Bitbucket URL in the build log in some cases.

    PLUGIN_NAME 887.va_d359b_3d2d8d does not include the Bitbucket OAuth access token as part of the Bitbucket URL in the build log.
