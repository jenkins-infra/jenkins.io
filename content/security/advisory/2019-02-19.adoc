- id: SECURITY-1320
  title: Sandbox Bypasses in Script Security Plugin
  reporter: >
    Daniel Beck, CloudBees, Inc.
  cve: CVE-2019-1003024
  cvss:
    severity: high
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  plugins:
    - name: script-security
      fixed: "1.53"
      previous: "1.52"
  description: |
    The previously implemented script security sandbox protections prohibiting the use of unsafe AST transforming annotations such as `@Grab` (link:../2019-01-08/#SECURITY-1266[2019-01-08 fix for SECURITY-1266]) could be circumvented through use of various Groovy language features:

    * Use of `AnnotationCollector`
    * Import aliasing
    * Referencing annotation types using their full class name

    This allowed users with Overall/Read permission, or the ability to control Jenkinsfile or sandboxed Pipeline shared library contents in SCM, to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins master.

    Using `AnnotationCollector` is now newly prohibited in sandboxed scripts such as Pipelines.
    Importing any of the annotations considered unsafe will now result in an error.
    During the compilation phase, both simple and full class names of prohibited annotations are rejected for element annotations.

  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Cloud Foundry Plugin allowed capturing credentials
  reporter: >
    Thomas de Grenier de Latour
  cve: CVE-2019-1003025
  cvss:
    severity: medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  plugins:
    - name: cloudfoundry
      fixed: "2.3.2" # Released 2019-02-19
      previous: "2.3.1"
  description: |
    Cloud Foundry Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
    This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

    Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

    This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer (for global configuration) or Item/Configure permissions (for job configuration).

  title: SSRF vulnerability due to missing permission check in Mattermost Notification Plugin

    Viktor Gazdag
  cve: CVE-2019-1003026
  cvss:
    severity: medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  plugins:
    - name: mattermost
      fixed: "2.6.3" # Released 2019-02-12
      previous: "2.6.2"
  description: |
    A missing permission check in a form validation method in Mattermost Notification Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read permission to initiate a connection test, connecting to an attacker-specified Mattermost server and room and posting a message.

    Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

    This form validation method now requires POST requests and performs a permission check.

  cve: CVE-2019-1003027
  cvss:
    severity: medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

    - name: octopusdeploy
      fixed: "1.9.0" # Released 2018-11-05
      previous: "1.8.1"
  description: |
    A missing permission check in a form validation method in OctopusDeploy Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read permission to initiate a connection test, sending an HTTP HEAD request to an attacker-specified URL, returning HTTP response code if successful, or exception error message otherwise.

    Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

    This form validation method now requires POST requests and performs a permission check.

      previous: "1.0.0"
  description: |
    A missing permission check in a form validation method in Acunetix Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read permission to initiate a connection test, sending an HTTP GET request to an attacker-specified URL, adding a `/me` suffix, returning whether the connection could be established and whether the HTTP response code is 200.

    Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

    This form validation method now requires POST requests and performs a permission check.

  cvss:
    severity: medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

    - name: ease-plugin
      fixed: "2.0" # Released 2018-11-14
      previous: "1.2.12"
  description: |
    Arxan MAM Publisher Plugin stored the username and password connection credentials in its configuration unencrypted in jobs' `config.xml` files on the Jenkins master.
    This key could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission, or access to the master file system.

    While masked from view using a password form field, the password was transferred in plain text to users when accessing the job configuration form.

    The plugin now integrates with plugin:credentials[Credentials Plugin].
