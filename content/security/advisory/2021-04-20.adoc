  title: Denial of service vulnerability in bundled Jetty
  cve: CVE-2021-28165
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
  description: |-
    Jenkins bundles Winstone-Jetty, a wrapper around Jetty, to act as HTTP and servlet server when started using `java -jar jenkins.war`.
    This is how Jenkins is run when using any of the installers or packages, but not when run using servlet containers such as Tomcat.

    Jenkins 2.285 and earlier, LTS 2.277.2 and earlier bundles Jetty 9.4.38 or earlier with multiple security vulnerabilities, including https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-26vr-8j45-3r4w[CVE-2021-28165].
    This vulnerability may allow unauthenticated attackers to cause a denial of service if Winstone-Jetty is configured to handle SSL/TLS connections.

    Jenkins LTS 2.277.3 updates the bundled Jetty to 9.4.39.
    Jetty was already previously updated to 9.4.39 in the 2.286 weekly release.
