  title: Sandbox bypass via default method parameter expression in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2109
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    Sandbox protection in PLUGIN_NAME 2.78 and earlier can be circumvented through default parameter expressions in CPS-transformed methods.

    This allows attackers able to specify and run sandboxed Pipelines to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.

    These expressions are subject to sandbox protection in PLUGIN_NAME 2.79.

  title: Sandbox bypass vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME

  description: |-
    Sandbox protection in PLUGIN_NAME 1.69 and earlier can be circumvented during the script compilation phase by applying AST transforming annotations such as `@Grab` to imports or by using them inside of other annotations.
    This affects both script execution (typically invoked from other plugins like Pipeline) as well as HTTP endpoints providing sandboxed script validation.

    Users with Overall/Read permission can exploit this to bypass sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller.

    This issue is due to an incomplete fix of link:/security/advisory/2019-01-08/#SECURITY-1266[SECURITY-1266].

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.70 disallows all known unsafe AST transformations on imports or when used inside of other annotations.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.13.0 and earlier does not escape the error message for the Project Repository Base URL field form validation.

    PLUGIN_NAME stores a secret key in its global configuration.

    While the credential is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form by PLUGIN_NAME 0.11.4 and earlier.

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.25 and earlier does not configure the XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

    This allows a user able to control the input files for its post-build step to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.26 disables external entity processing for its XML parser.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.0.4 and earlier does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
    This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

    Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

    This form validation method requires POST requests and Item/Configure permission in PLUGIN_NAME 1.0.5.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.0.4 and earlier provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

    This functionality does not correctly check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
    Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

    An enumeration of credentials IDs in PLUGIN_NAME 1.0.5 requires the permission to configure a project.

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.12 and earlier did not escape values received from parsed JSON files when rendering them, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.13 escape affected values from the parsed file as they are recorded.

    NOTE: This fix is only applied to newly recorded data after a fixed version of the plugin is installed; historical data may still contain unsafe values.
