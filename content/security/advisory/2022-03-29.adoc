  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2022-28133
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.0.0 through 3.1.0 (inclusive) does not limit URL schemes for callback URLs on OAuth consumers.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to create BitBucket Server consumers.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.2.0 limits allowed URL schemes to prevent creation of consumers with `javascript:` URL scheme.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.1.0 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to create, view, and delete BitBucket Server consumers.

    PLUGIN_NAME provides a framework for plugins integrating Jenkins with instant messaging services.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.41 and earlier stores passwords for group chats unencrypted in the global configuration file of plugins based on PLUGIN_NAME on the Jenkins controller.

    These passwords can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.42 stores passwords for group chats encrypted once the integrating plugin's configuration is saved again.

    PLUGIN_NAME 165.v817928553942 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials.

    Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    This form validation method requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission in PLUGIN_NAME 166.v0cc6208295b5.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.2.1 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

    This allows attackers with Item/Configure permission to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.2.2 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 0.7.0 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to:

    * connect to an attacker-specified host using attacker-specified username and password, performing a connection test,
    * disable SSL/TLS validation for the entire Jenkins controller JVM as part of the connection test (see SECURITY-2081 / CVE-2022-28142),
    * and test a rollback with attacker-specified parameters.

    Additionally, these endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.7.1 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected HTTP endpoints.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.3 and earlier uses a patched fork of an old version of the file browser for workspaces, archived artifacts, and `userContent/` from Jenkins core (`DirectoryBrowserSupport`) to serve reports.

    This fork removes the `Content-Security-Policy` header functionality introduced for link:/security/advisory/2015-12-09/#stored-xss-vulnerability-through-workspace-files-and-archived-artifacts[SECURITY-95].

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission or otherwise able to control report contents.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.4 uses the built-in Jenkins file browser to serve reports.

    NOTE: Some reports generated by this plugin rely on the ability to execute JavaScript.
    See https://plugins.jenkins.io/ci-with-toad-edge/[the plugin's documentation] for a detailed explanation and options.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.3 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.3 and earlier uses a patched fork of an old version of the file browser for workspaces, archived artifacts, and `userContent/` from Jenkins core (`DirectoryBrowserSupport`) to serve reports.

    The fork did not receive the fix for link:/security/advisory/2021-10-06/#SECURITY-2481[SECURITY-2481] in Jenkins 2.315 and LTS 2.303.2.

    This results in a path traversal vulnerability allowing attackers with Item/Read permission to obtain the contents of arbitrary files on Windows controllers.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.4 uses the built-in Jenkins file browser to serve reports, inheriting the fix in Jenkins core if running on a recent enough version.
