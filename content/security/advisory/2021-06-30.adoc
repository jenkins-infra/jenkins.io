  title: Improper permission checks allow canceling queue items and aborting builds
  cve: CVE-2021-21670
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    Jenkins 2.299 and earlier, LTS 2.289.1 and earlier allows users to cancel queue items and abort builds of jobs for which they have Item/Cancel permission even when they do not have Item/Read permission.

    Jenkins 2.300, LTS 2.289.2 requires that users have Item/Read permission for applicable types in addition to Item/Cancel permission.

    As a workaround on earlier versions of Jenkins, do not grant Item/Cancel permission to users who do not have Item/Read permission.

  title: Session fixation vulnerability
  cve: CVE-2021-21671
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    Jenkins 2.299 and earlier, LTS 2.289.1 and earlier does not invalidate the existing session on login.
    This allows attackers to use social engineering techniques to gain administrator access to Jenkins.

    This vulnerability was introduced in Jenkins 2.266 and LTS 2.277.1.

    Jenkins 2.300, LTS 2.289.2 invalidates the existing session on login.

    NOTE: In case of problems, administrators can choose a different implementation by setting the link:/doc/book/managing/system-properties/#hudson-security-securityrealm-sessionfixationprotectionmode[Java system property `hudson.security.SecurityRealm.sessionFixationProtectionMode`] to `2`, or disable the fix entirely by setting that system property to `0`.

  title: XXE vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21672
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.0 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

    This allows attackers with the ability to control the report files parsed using this plugin to have Jenkins parse a crafted report file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.1 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.

  title: Open redirect vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21673
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.6.0 and earlier improperly determines that a redirect URL after login is legitimately pointing to Jenkins.

    This allows attackers to perform phishing attacks by having users go to a Jenkins URL that will forward them to a different site after successful authentication.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.6.1 only redirects to relative (Jenkins) URLs.

  - name: cas-plugin
    previous: 1.6.0

  title: Missing permission check in PLUGIN_NAME allows viewing pending requests
  cve: CVE-2021-21674
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.2.6 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to view the list of pending requests.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.2.7 requires Overall/Administer permission to view the list of pending requests.

    NOTE: The previous sentence originally stated that Overall/Read permission was newly required. This statement was incorrect and has been fixed on 2021-07-05.
  plugins:
  - name: requests
    previous: 2.2.6
    fixed: 2.2.7

  title: CSRF vulnerabilities in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21675
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.2.12 and earlier does not require POST requests to request and apply changes, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.

    These vulnerabilities allow attackers to create requests and/or have administrators apply pending requests, like renaming or deleting jobs, deleting builds, etc.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.2.13 requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoints.

    This was partially fixed in PLUGIN_NAME 2.2.8 to require POST requests for some of the affected HTTP endpoints, but the endpoint allowing administrators to apply pending requests remained unprotected until 2.2.13.
  plugins:
  - name: requests
    previous: 2.2.12
    fixed: 2.2.13

  title: Missing permission check in PLUGIN_NAME allows sending emails
  cve: CVE-2021-21676
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.2.7 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to send test emails to an attacker-specified email address.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.2.8 requires Overall/Administer permission to send test emails.
  plugins:
  - name: requests
    previous: 2.2.7
    fixed: 2.2.8
