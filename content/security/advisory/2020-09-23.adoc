  title: Sandbox bypass vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2279
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME provides a sandbox feature that allows low privileged users to define scripts, including Pipelines, that are generally safe to execute.
    Calls to code defined inside a sandboxed script are intercepted, and various allowlists are checked to determine whether the call is to be allowed.

    In PLUGIN_NAME 1.74 and earlier, any calls from outside a sandboxed script to code defined inside a sandboxed script were always allowed.
    As sandboxed scripts can communicate their results through script return values and similar mechanisms, this could result in code defined inside of a sandboxed script to be called without sandbox protection.

    This vulnerability allows attackers with permission to define and run sandboxed scripts, including Pipelines, to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.75 will prevent code defined inside a sandbox from being invoked outside a sandboxed script.

    In rare cases, invocations of sandboxed scripts may begin failing if the script return value or script binding include code defined in the sandbox and is further processed by the calling code.
    To resolve this issue, the affected values need to be converted inside the sandboxed script to a known safe type, such as `String`.

    For compatibility with this change, the following plugins should be upgraded to the versions specified:

    * plugin:email-ext[Email Extension Plugin] should be updated to version 2.77 or newer.
    * plugin:warnings-ng[Warnings Next Generation Plugin] should be updated to version 8.4.3 or newer.
    * plugin:warnings[Warnings Plugin] should be updated to version 5.0.2 or newer.

  title: CSRF vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME allows remote code execution
  cve: CVE-2020-2280
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 5.0.1 and earlier does not require POST requests for a form validation method intended for testing custom warnings parsers, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code.

    PLUGIN_NAME 5.0.2 requires POST requests for the affected form validation method.

    This vulnerability was caused by an incomplete fix to link:/security/advisory/2019-01-28/[SECURITY-1295].
  plugins:
  - name: warnings
    previous: 5.0.1
    fixed: 5.0.2

  title: CSRF vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.8 and earlier does not require POST requests for several HTTP endpoints, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    This vulnerability allows attackers to reserve, unreserve, unlock, and reset resources.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.9 requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoints.
  plugins:
  - name: lockable-resources
    previous: '2.8'
    fixed: '2.9'

  title: Missing permission check in PLUGIN_NAME allows reconfiguring the plugin
  cve: CVE-2020-2282

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 0.6 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to configure the plugin.

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.7 requires Overall/Administer permission to configure the plugin.

  - name: implied-labels

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2283
  cvss:
    severity: High

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.4.5 and earlier does not escape changeset contents when showing them on the build page.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to provide Liquibase changesets evaluated by the plugin.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.4.7 no longer supports evaluating changesets.

  - name: liquibase-runner

  title: XXE vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2284
  cvss:
    severity: High

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.4.5 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

    This allows attackers able to provide Liquibase changesets evaluated by the plugin to have Jenkins parse a crafted XML file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.4.7 no longer parses Liquibase changesets.
  plugins:
  - name: liquibase-runner
    previous: 1.4.5
    fixed: 1.4.7

  title: Missing permission check in PLUGIN_NAME allows enumerating credentials IDs
  cve: CVE-2020-2285
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.4.7 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

    An enumeration of credentials IDs in PLUGIN_NAME 1.4.8 requires the appropriate permissions.
  plugins:
  - name: liquibase-runner
    previous: 1.4.7
    fixed: 1.4.8
