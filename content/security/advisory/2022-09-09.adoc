  title: HTTP/2 denial of service vulnerability in bundled Jetty
  cve: CVE-2022-2048
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
  description: |-
    Jenkins bundles Winstone-Jetty, a wrapper around Jetty, to act as HTTP and servlet server when started using `java -jar jenkins.war`.
    This is how Jenkins is run when using any of the installers or packages, but not when run using servlet containers such as Tomcat.

    Jenkins LTS 2.346.3 and earlier, 2.362 and earlier bundle versions of Jetty affected by the security vulnerability https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/security/advisories/GHSA-wgmr-mf83-7x4j[CVE-2022-2048].
    This vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to make the Jenkins UI unresponsive by exploiting Jetty's handling of invalid HTTP/2 requests, causing a denial of service.

    NOTE: This only affects instances that enable HTTP/2, typically using the `--http2Port` argument to `java -jar jenkins.war` or corresponding options in service configuration files.
    It is disabled by default in all native installers and the Docker images provided by the Jenkins project.

    Jenkins LTS 2.361.1 updates the bundled Jetty to version 10.0.11, which is unaffected by this issue.

    Jetty was already previously updated to version 10.0.11 in the 2.363 weekly release.

    Administrators unable to update to these releases of Jenkins (or newer) are advised to disable HTTP/2.

    NOTE: This advisory has been updated to correctly reference Jenkins versions 2.363 and 2.361.1.
