  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in job build time trend
  cve: CVE-2020-2220
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    Jenkins 2.244 and earlier, LTS 2.235.1 and earlier does not escape the agent name on build time trend pages.
    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users with Agent/Configure permission.

    Jenkins 2.245, LTS 2.235.2 escapes the agent name.

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in upstream cause
  cve: CVE-2020-2221
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    Jenkins 2.244 and earlier, LTS 2.235.1 and earlier does not escape the upstream job's display name shown as part of a build cause.
    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users with Job/Configure permission.

    Jenkins 2.245, LTS 2.235.2 escapes the job display name.

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in 'keep forever' badge icons
  cve: CVE-2020-2222
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    Jenkins 2.244 and earlier, LTS 2.235.1 and earlier does not escape the job name in the 'Keep this build forever' badge tooltip.
    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure job names.

    As job names do not generally support the character set needed for XSS, this is believed to be difficult to exploit in common configurations.

    Jenkins 2.245, LTS 2.235.2 escapes the job name in the 'Keep this build forever' badge tooltip.

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in console links
  cve: CVE-2020-2223
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    Jenkins 2.244 and earlier, LTS 2.235.1 and earlier does not escape the `href` attribute of links to downstream jobs displayed in the build console page.
    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users with Job/Configure permission.

    Jenkins 2.245, LTS 2.235.2 escapes the `href` attribute of these links.

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in single axis builds tooltips in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2224
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.16 and earlier does not escape node names shown in tooltips on the overview page of builds with a single axis.
    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users with Agent/Configure permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.17 escapes the node names shown in these tooltips.

  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.16 and earlier does not escape the axis names shown in tooltips on the overview page of builds with multiple axes.
    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users with Job/Configure permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.17 escapes the axis names shown in these tooltips.

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2226
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.6.1 and earlier does not escape user names shown in the permission table.
    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
    When using project-based matrix authorization, this vulnerability can be exploited by a user with Job/Configure or Agent/Configure permission, otherwise by users with Overall/Administer permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.6.2 escapes user names in the permission table.
  plugins:
  - name: matrix-auth
    previous: 2.6.1
    fixed: 2.6.2

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2227
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME is a framework plugin allowing other plugins to provide a way to deploy artifacts.
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.2 and earlier does not escape the URL displayed in the build home page.
    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to provide the location.

    The exploitability of this vulnerability depends on the specific implementation using PLUGIN_NAME.
    The Jenkins security team is not aware of any exploitable implementation.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.3 escapes the URL.
  plugins:
  - name: deployer-framework
    previous: '1.2'
    fixed: '1.3'
- id: SECURITY-1792
  title: Improper authorization of users and groups with the same base name in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2228
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.5 and earlier does not differentiate between user names and hierarchical group names when performing authorization.
    This allows an attacker with permissions to create groups in GitLab to gain the privileges granted to another user or group.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.6 performs user name and group name authorization checks using the appropriate GitLab APIs.
  plugins:
  - name: gitlab-oauth
    previous: '1.5'
    fixed: '1.6'
