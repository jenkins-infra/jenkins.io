  title: Incorrect permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-28668
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    Permissions in Jenkins can be enabled and disabled.
    Some permissions are disabled by default, e.g., Overall/Manage or Item/Extended Read.
    Disabled permissions cannot be granted directly, only through greater permissions that imply them (e.g., Overall/Administer or Item/Configure).

    PLUGIN_NAME 587.v2872c41fa_e51 and earlier grants permissions even after they've been disabled.

    This allows attackers to have greater access than they're entitled to after the following operations took place:

    1. A permission is granted to attackers directly or through groups.
    2. The permission is disabled, e.g., through the script console.

    PLUGIN_NAME 587.588.v850a_20a_30162 does not grant disabled permissions.

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-28669
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 3.3.2 and earlier does not escape class and method names shown on the UI.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control input files for the 'Record JaCoCo coverage report' post-build action.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.3.2.1 escapes class and method names shown on the UI.

  - name: jacoco
    previous: 3.3.2
    fixed: 3.3.2.1

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-28670
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.13 and earlier does not escape a variable representing the current view's URL in inline JavaScript.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by authenticated attackers with Overall/Read permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.14 obtains the current URL in a way not susceptible to XSS.

  title: CSRF vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-28671
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 4.5.0 and earlier does not require POST requests for a connection test HTTP endpoint, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    This vulnerability allows attackers to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

    PLUGIN_NAME 4.5.1 requires POST requests for the affected connection test HTTP endpoint.
  plugins:
  - name: octoperf
    previous: 4.5.0
    fixed: 4.5.1
- id: SECURITY-3067 (2)
  reporter: Yaroslav Afenkin, CloudBees, Inc.
  title: Missing permission check in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-28672
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 4.5.1 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a connection test HTTP endpoint.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

    PLUGIN_NAME 4.5.2 properly performs a permission check when accessing the affected connection test HTTP endpoint.
  plugins:
  - name: octoperf
    previous: 4.5.1
    fixed: 4.5.2

  reporter: Yaroslav Afenkin, CloudBees, Inc.
  title: Missing permission check in PLUGIN_NAME allows enumerating credentials IDs
  cve: CVE-2023-28673
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 4.5.2 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.
    Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

    An enumeration of credentials IDs in PLUGIN_NAME 4.5.3 requires the appropriate permissions.
  plugins:
  - name: octoperf
    previous: 4.5.2
    fixed: 4.5.3

  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-28674 (CSRF), CVE-2023-28675 (missing permission check)
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 4.5.2 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to a previously configured Octoperf server using attacker-specified credentials.

    Additionally, these endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 4.5.3 requires POST requests and the appropriate permissions for the affected HTTP endpoints.
  plugins:
  - name: octoperf
    previous: 4.5.2
    fixed: 4.5.3

  title: CSRF vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME results in RCE
  cve: CVE-2023-28676
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.0 and earlier does not require POST requests for the HTTP endpoint converting a Freestyle project to Pipeline, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    This vulnerability allows attackers to create a Pipeline based on a Freestyle project.
    Combined with SECURITY-2966, this can result in the execution of unsandboxed Pipeline scripts.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

  title: Command injection vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME results in RCE
  cve: CVE-2023-28677
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.0 and earlier uses basic string concatenation to convert Freestyle projects' Build Environment, Build Steps, and Post-build Actions to the equivalent Pipeline step invocations.

    This allows attackers able to configure Freestyle projects to prepare a crafted configuration that injects Pipeline script code into the (unsandboxed) Pipeline resulting from a conversion by PLUGIN_NAME.
    If an administrator converts the Freestyle project to a Pipeline, the script will be pre-approved.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.26 and earlier does not escape file names from Cppcheck report files before showing them on the Jenkins UI.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control report file contents.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.1.2 and earlier provides the "Generic JS Portlet" feature that lets a user populate a portlet using a custom JavaScript expression.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by authenticated attackers with Overall/Read permission.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
