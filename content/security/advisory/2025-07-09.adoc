  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 687.v619cb_15e923f and earlier does not properly mask (i.e., replace with asterisks) credentials present in exception error messages that are written to the build log.

    PLUGIN_NAME 687.689.v1a_f775332fc9 rethrows exceptions that contain credentials, masking those credentials in the error messages.

    PLUGIN_NAME implements a choice build parameter that lists the configured Git SCMâ€™s branches, tags, pull requests, and revisions.

    PLUGIN_NAME 439.vb_0e46ca_14534 and earlier does not validate that the Git parameter value submitted to the build matches one of the offered choices.

    This allows attackers with Item/Build permission to inject arbitrary values into Git parameters.

    PLUGIN_NAME 444.vca_b_84d3703c2 validates that the Git parameter value submitted to the build matches one of the offered choices.
