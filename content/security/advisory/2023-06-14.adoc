  title: CSRF protection bypass vulnerability
  cve: CVE-2023-35141
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    Jenkins provides context menus for various UI elements, like links to jobs and builds, or breadcrumbs.

    In Jenkins 2.399 and earlier, LTS 2.387.3 and earlier, POST requests are sent in order to load the list of context actions.
    If part of the URL includes insufficiently escaped user-provided values, a victim may be tricked into sending a POST request to an unexpected endpoint (e.g., the Script Console) by opening a context menu.

    As of publication of this advisory, we are aware of insufficiently escaped context menu URLs for label expressions, allowing attackers with Item/Configure permissions to exploit this vulnerability.

    Jenkins 2.400, LTS 2.401.1 sends GET requests to load the list of context actions.

  title: SSL/TLS certificate validation disabled by default in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-35142
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME allows to globally enable or disable SSL/TLS validation for connections to the Checkmarx server.
    PLUGIN_NAME 2022.4.3 and earlier disables it by default.
    Unless changed by an administrator, it would cause all connections to the Checkmarx server to ignore SSL/TLS validation, thereby enabling potential man-in-the-middle attacks.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2023.2.6 enables SSL/TLS validation by default.
    Administrators who do not want SSL/TLS validation for connections to the Checkmarx server to be disabled are advised to review their configuration.

  title: Missing permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-3315
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.4.1 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods implementing form validation.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to check for the existence of an attacker-specified file path on the Jenkins controller file system.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.4.2 requires Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation methods.

  title: Missing permission check in PLUGIN_NAME allows enumerating credentials IDs
  cve: CVE-2023-32261
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 0.9.3 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.
    Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

    An enumeration of credentials IDs in PLUGIN_NAME 0.9.3.1 requires the appropriate permissions.

  title: Exposure of system-scoped credentials in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-32262
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 0.9.3 and earlier does not set the appropriate context for credentials lookup, allowing the use of System-scoped credentials otherwise reserved for the global configuration.

    This allows attackers with Item/Configure permission to access and capture credentials they are not entitled to.

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.9.3.1 defines the appropriate context for credentials lookup.

  - name: dimensionsscm

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-35143

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.10 and earlier does not escape the versions of build artifacts on the Build Artifacts As Maven Repository page.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control maven project versions in `pom.xml`.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.10 and earlier does not escape project and build display names on the Build Artifacts As Maven Repository page.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to change project or build display names.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 5.0.1 and earlier does not correctly escape the file path and the project name for the Log file field form validation.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.

    NOTE: This issue is caused by an incomplete fix of link:/security/advisory/2020-07-02/#SECURITY-1775[SECURITY-1775].

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 41.v32d86a_313b_4a and earlier does not escape names of jobs used as buildings blocks for Template Workflow Job.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to create jobs.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

  title: Arbitrary file read vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-35147

    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME allows downloading activity logs of AWS Simple Queue Service (SQS) queues.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.0.12 and earlier does not restrict the queue name path parameter in the corresponding HTTP endpoint, allowing attackers with Item/Read permission to obtain the contents of arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.6 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

    Additionally, these HTTP endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
