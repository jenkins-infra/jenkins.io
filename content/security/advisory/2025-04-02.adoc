  title: Missing permission check allows retrieving agent configurations
  cve: CVE-2025-31720
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    Jenkins 2.503 and earlier, LTS 2.492.2 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

    This allows attackers with Agent/Create permission but without Agent/Extended Read permission to copy an agent, gaining access to its configuration.

    Jenkins 2.504, LTS 2.492.3 requires Agent/Extended Read permission to copy an agent.

  title: Missing permission check allows retrieving secrets from agent configurations
  cve: CVE-2025-31721
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    Jenkins 2.503 and earlier, LTS 2.492.2 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

    This allows attackers with Agent/Create permission but without Agent/Configure permission to copy an agent, gaining access to encrypted secrets in its configuration.

    NOTE: This is due to an incomplete fix of link:/security/advisory/2025-03-05/#SECURITY-3495[SECURITY-3495].

    Jenkins 2.504, LTS 2.492.3 requires Agent/Configure permission to copy an agent containing secrets.

  title: Script Security sandbox bypass vulnerability through folder-scoped libraries
    in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2025-31722
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME allows defining libraries both in the global configuration, as well as scoped to folders containing the pipelines using them.
    While libraries in the global configuration can only be set up by administrators and can therefore be trusted, libraries defined in folders can be configured by users with Item/Configure permission.

    In PLUGIN_NAME 2.5.3 and earlier, libraries defined in folders are not subject to sandbox protection.
    This vulnerability allows attackers with Item/Configure permission to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.

    In PLUGIN_NAME 2.5.4, libraries defined in folders are subject to sandbox protection.

  - name: templating-engine

  title: CSRF vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2025-31723
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.4.6 and earlier does not require POST requests for multiple HTTP endpoints, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.

    These vulnerabilities allow attackers to change and reset the build queue order.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.4.7 requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoints.

    NOTE: Administrators can enable equivalent HTTP endpoints without CSRF protection via the global configuration.

  - name: simple-queue

  title: API keys stored in plain text by PLUGIN_NAME

    PLUGIN_NAME 4.0.0-282.v5096a_c2db_275 and earlier stores Verisium Manager vAPI keys unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

    These API keys can be viewed by users with Item/Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

    PLUGIN_NAME 4.0.1-286.v9e25a_740b_a_48 stores Verisium Manager vAPI keys encrypted once affected job configurations are saved again.

  - name: vmanager-plugin

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.0 stores passwords unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

    These passwords can be viewed by users with Item/Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.1.1 and earlier stores AsakusaSatellite API keys unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

    These API keys can be viewed by users with Item/Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

    Additionally, the job configuration form does not mask these API keys, increasing the potential for attackers to observe and capture them.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
