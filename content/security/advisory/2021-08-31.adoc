  title: RCE vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21677
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.4.0 and earlier does not apply https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/tree/master/jep/200[JEP-200 deserialization protection] to Java objects it deserializes from disk.

    This results in a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control agent processes.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.4.1 configures its Java object deserialization to only deserialize safe types.
  plugins:
  - name: code-coverage-api
    previous: 1.4.0
    fixed: 1.4.1

  title: PLUGIN_NAME allows bypassing CSRF protection for any URL
  cve: CVE-2021-21678
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    An extension point in Jenkins allows selectively disabling cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection for specific URLs.
    PLUGIN_NAME implements this extension point for the URL that users are redirected to after login.

    In PLUGIN_NAME 2.0.7 and earlier this implementation is too permissive, allowing attackers to craft URLs that would bypass the CSRF protection of any target URL.

    This vulnerability was originally introduced in PLUGIN_NAME 1.1.3.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.0.8 restricts which URLs it disables cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection for to the one URL that needs it.

  title: PLUGIN_NAME allows bypassing CSRF protection for any URL
  cve: CVE-2021-21679
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    An extension point in Jenkins allows selectively disabling cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection for specific URLs.
    PLUGIN_NAME implements this extension point for URLs used by a JavaScript component.

    In PLUGIN_NAME 179.vf6841393099e and earlier this implementation is too permissive, allowing attackers to craft URLs that would bypass the CSRF protection of any target URL.

    This vulnerability was originally introduced in PLUGIN_NAME 164.v5b48baa961d2.

    PLUGIN_NAME 180.v8b1e80e6f242 no longer allows bypassing CSRF protection for URLs used by the JavaScript component.
    Instead, that component was reconfigured to pass the expected CSRF token.

  title: XXE vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21680
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.20 and earlier does not configure its XML transformer to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

    This allows attackers able to configure views to have Jenkins parse a crafted view XML definition that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.21 disables external entity resolution for its XML transformer.
  plugins:
  - name: nested-view
    previous: '1.20'
    fixed: '1.21'

  title: Password stored in plain text by PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21681
  cvss:
    severity: Low
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 0.7.4 and earlier stores the passwords to authenticate against the Docker registry unencrypted in the global `config.xml` file on the Jenkins controller as part of its worker templates configuration.

    These passwords can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.7.5 stores the Docker passwords encrypted.
    This change is effective after Jenkins restarts.
  plugins:
  - name: nomad
    previous: 0.7.4
    fixed: 0.7.5
