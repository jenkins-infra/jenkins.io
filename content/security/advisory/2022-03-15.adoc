  title: Sensitive parameter values captured in build metadata files by PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2022-27195
  cvss:
    severity: Low
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.43 and earlier captures environment variables passed to builds triggered using PLUGIN_NAME, including password parameter values, in their `build.xml` files.
    These values are stored unencrypted and can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.43.1 does not store captured environment variables in `build.xml` files.

    NOTE: Existing `build.xml` files are not automatically updated to remove captured environment variables.
    They need to be manually cleaned up.
    To help with this, the plugin will report environment variables stored in `build.xml` as unloadable data in the Old Data Monitor, that allows discarding this data.
    Build records are only loaded from disk when needed however, so some builds stored in Jenkins may not immediately appear there.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.4.0 and earlier does not escape the names of jobs in the favorite column.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure or Item/Create permissions.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.18 and earlier does not perform URL validation for the Iframe Portlet's Iframe source URL.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to configure views.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.18.1 performs URL validation for the Iframe Portlet's Iframe source URL.

    Additionally, PLUGIN_NAME 2.18.1 sets the `sandbox` attribute for the iframe to restrict the included page.

    NOTE: In case of problems, the link:/doc/book/managing/system-properties/[Java system property] `hudson.plugins.view.dashboard.core.IframePortlet.sandboxAttributeValue` can be used to customize the `sandbox` attribute value.
    The Java system property `hudson.plugins.view.dashboard.core.IframePortlet.doNotUseSandbox` can be used to disable the sandbox completely.

    PLUGIN_NAME 189.v3551d5642995 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an AWS service using an attacker-specified token.

    Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    This form validation method requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission in PLUGIN_NAME 191.vcb_f183ce58b_9.

  title: Agent-to-controller security bypass in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2022-27201
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME defines a controller/agent message that processes a given file as XML and returns version information.
    The XML parser is not configured to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks, which is only a problem if XML documents are parsed on the Jenkins controller.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.13 and earlier does not restrict execution of the controller/agent message to agents, and implements no limitations about the file path that can be parsed.
    This allows attackers able to control agent processes to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

    NOTE: This vulnerability is only exploitable in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier.
    See the link:/doc/upgrade-guide/2.303/#upgrading-to-jenkins-lts-2-303-3[LTS upgrade guide].

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.14 does not allow the affected controller/agent message to be submitted by agents for execution on the controller.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.3.1 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.
    Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.
