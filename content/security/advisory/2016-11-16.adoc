This advisory announces the fix for a previously disclosed zero-day vulnerability in Jenkins.

== Description


=== Remote code execution vulnerability in remoting module
*SECURITY-360 / CVE-2016-9299*

An unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability allowed attackers to transfer a serialized Java object to the Jenkins CLI, making Jenkins connect to an attacker-controlled LDAP server, which in turn can send a serialized payload leading to code execution, bypassing existing protection mechanisms.

== Severity

* SECURITY-360 is considered *link:http://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H[critical]* as it allows unprivileged attackers to execute arbitrary code.

== Affected versions

* All Jenkins main line releases up to and including 2.31
* All Jenkins LTS releases up to and including 2.19.2

== Fix

* Jenkins main line users should update to 2.32
* Jenkins LTS users should update to 2.19.3

These versions include fixes to all the vulnerabilities described above. All prior versions are affected by these vulnerabilities.

== Notes

As part of this fix, a number of other so-called "gadgets" were reviewed and are now also being prohibited. We tracked this activity as SECURITY-317.
