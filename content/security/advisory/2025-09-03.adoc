  title: File system information disclosure vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2025-58458
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 6.3.2 and earlier, except 6.1.4 and 6.2.1, allows specifying the experimental `amazon-s3` protocol for use with the bundled JGit library.
    This protocol authenticates against Amazon S3 based on contents of the file whose path is provided as the authority part of the URL (`amazon-s3://path-to-file@bucketname/folder`).

    While use of this protocol in PLUGIN_NAME to perform any actions always fails due to a bug in the plugin, error messages can be used to determine whether the specified file path exists on the controller.

    This allows attackers to check for the existence of an attacker-specified file path on the Jenkins controller file system.
    Whether an attacker has the permissions to exploit this vulnerability depends on the installed plugins that expose PLUGIN_NAME functionality to users.
    For example, attackers with Credentials/Use Item permission (implied by Item/Configure) can use form field validation responses of URL fields in Git Plugin.

    NOTE: Jenkins instances using command line Git exclusively (the default) are unaffected by this vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 6.3.3 prohibits use of the `amazon-s3` protocol for use with JGit.
  plugins:
  - name: git-client
    previous: 6.3.2
    fixed: 6.3.3

  title: SMTP command injection vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2025-7962
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.1.3-2 and earlier bundles versions of Angus Mail vulnerable to https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-7962[CVE-2025-7962].

    This allows attackers able to control recipient email addresses of emails sent by Jenkins to send emails with arbitrary contents to arbitrary recipients.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.1.3-3 updates Angus Mail to version 2.0.4, which is unaffected by this issue.
  plugins:
  - name: jakarta-mail-api
    previous: 2.1.3-2
    fixed: 2.1.3-3

  title: Missing permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME allow enumerating graph IDs
  cve: CVE-2025-58459
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 322.v22f4db_18e2dd and earlier does not perform permission checks in its REST API endpoints.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate graph IDs.
    These IDs can be used to access those graphs.

    PLUGIN_NAME 347.v32a_eb_0493c4f requires Overall/Administer permission to access its REST API endpoints.
  plugins:
  - name: global-build-stats
    previous: 322.v22f4db_18e2dd
    fixed: 347.v32a_eb_0493c4f

  title: Missing permission check in PLUGIN_NAME allows capturing credentials
  cve: CVE-2025-58460
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 3.1543.v8446b_92b_cd64 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.1543.1545.vf5a_4ec123769 requires Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation method.
  plugins:
  - name: opentelemetry
    previous: 3.1543.v8446b_92b_cd64
    fixed: 3.1543.1545.vf5a_4ec123769
