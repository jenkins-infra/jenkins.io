  title: Persisted XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2019-10325
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME rendered the name of a custom warnings parser unescaped on Jenkins web pages.
    This allowed attackers with Job/Configure permission to define a custom parser whose name included HTML and JavaScript, resulting in a persisted cross-site scripting vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME now properly escapes custom warnings parser names.
  plugins:
  - name: warnings-ng
    previous: 5.0.0
    fixed: 5.1.0

  title: CSRF vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2019-10326
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME did not require that requests sent to the endpoint used to reset warning counts use POST.
    This resulted in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability that allows attackers to reset warning counts for future builds.

    PLUGIN_NAME now requires that these requests be sent via POST.
  plugins:
  - name: warnings-ng
    previous: 5.0.0
    fixed: 5.1.0

  title: XML External Entity processing vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2019-10327
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:L
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME did not configure its XML parser in a way that would prevent XML External Entity (XXE) processing.

    This allowed attackers able to control the contents of a temporary directory on the agent that the Maven build is executing on to have Jenkins parse a maliciously crafted XML file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins master, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

    PLUGIN_NAME no longer processes XML External Entities in XML documents.

  title: Unsafe entry in Script Security list of approved signatures in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2019-10328
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME provides a custom list of pre-approved signatures for Script Security.
    Those entries apply to all scripts with sandbox protection, such as Pipeline.

    One entry provided here was unsafe, as it allowed invoking arbitrary methods, bypassing sandbox protection.

    The unsafe pre-approved entry has been removed.

  title: PLUGIN_NAME stored credentials in plain text
  cve: CVE-2019-10329
  cvss:
    severity: Low
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME stored target passwords unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins master.
    These credentials could be viewed by users with access to the master file system.

    PLUGIN_NAME now stores its passwords encrypted.
  plugins:
  - name: influxdb
    previous: 1.21
    fixed: 1.22

  title: Improper handling of untrusted branches in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2019-10330
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L
  description: |-
    Multibranch pipelines are typically configured so that only committers to the repository are able to effectively propose changes to Jenkinsfiles.
    Changes to Jenkinsfiles in pull requests created by other users would not be trusted, and the target branch's Jenkinsfile content is used instead.

    PLUGIN_NAME did not implement this behavior.
    Attackers without commit access to the Git repository could therefore propose changes to Jenkinsfiles and have those be applied for PR builds despite the configuration declaring them to be untrusted.

    PLUGIN_NAME now implements the desired behavior of only trusting pull request content when those are trusted.
  plugins:
  - name: gitea
    previous: 1.1.1
    fixed: 1.1.2

    CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in PLUGIN_NAME allow capturing credentials
  cve: CVE-2019-10321 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10322 (missing permission check)
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
    This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

    Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

    As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is available.

  title: >
    Users with Overall/Read access could enumerate credential IDs in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2019-10323
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

    This functionality does not correctly check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
    Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

    As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is available.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME implements a number of API endpoints allowing users to trigger various actions related to releasing and promotion.

    These endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

    As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is available.
