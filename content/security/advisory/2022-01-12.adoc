    Jenkins 2.329 and earlier, LTS 2.319.1 and earlier does not require POST requests for the HTTP endpoint handling manual build requests when no security realm is set, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    This vulnerability allows attackers to trigger build of job without parameters.

    Jenkins 2.330, LTS 2.319.2 requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoint.

    This access key can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

    PLUGIN_NAME 4.0.2.8.1 stores access key encrypted once its configuration is saved again.

  title: User passwords transmitted in plain text by PLUGIN_NAME

    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME implements two separate modes: integration with ADSI on Windows, and an OS agnostic LDAP-based mode.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.25 and earlier does not encrypt the transmission of data between the Jenkins controller and Active Directory servers unless it is configured to use the OS agnostic LDAP mode and the system property `hudson.plugins.active_directory.ActiveDirectorySecurityRealm.forceLdaps` is set to `true`.

    This allows attackers able to capture network traffic between the Jenkins controller and Active Directory servers to obtain credentials of users logging into Jenkins, as well as credentials of the manager DN (LDAP mode) or the Windows/Active Directory user Jenkins is running as (ADSI mode).

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.25.1 adds an option to only connect to Active Directory via TLS/SSL to both modes (ADSI and LDAP).
    This option is enabled by default for new installations and is now the recommended way to enforce TLS/SSL for connections to Active Directory.
    Unlike the existing StartTLS option for the LDAP-based mode, it will not proceed using an insecure connection if establishing a TLS/SSL connection fails.

    Administrators upgrading from previous versions of the plugin will be shown a warning on the Jenkins UI requesting they update the plugin configuration unless the (now otherwise obsolete) flag `hudson.plugins.active_directory.ActiveDirectorySecurityRealm.forceLdaps` was set to `true`.

    NOTE: The plugin exposes configuration of the ADSI flags implementing the TLS/SSL requirement via the system properties `hudson.plugins.active_directory.ActiveDirectoryAuthenticationProvider.ADSI_FLAGS_OVERRIDE` and `hudson.plugins.active_directory.ActiveDirectoryAuthenticationProvider.ADSI_PASSWORDLESS_FLAGS_OVERRIDE`.
    See the plugin documentation for further details.

    NOTE: Care needs to be taken when reconfiguring the security realm to not accidentally lock yourself out.
    See link:/doc/book/security/access-control/disable/[the documentation] for advice how to resolve this problem if it occurs.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.55 and earlier does not use a constant-time comparison when checking whether two authentication tokens are equal.

    PLUGIN_NAME 9.10.2 and earlier does not restrict the name of a file when configuring a custom ID.

    PLUGIN_NAME 9.10.3 checks for the presence of prohibited directory separator characters in the custom ID.

    PLUGIN_NAME allows adding custom build badges with a custom description and optionally a link to a URL.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.9 and earlier does not escape the description and does not check for allowed protocols when creating a badge.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.9.1 escapes the description and check for allowed protocols when creating a badge.

  title: Improper credentials masking in PLUGIN_NAME

  description: |-
    Pipelines display commands executed in their Pipeline step descriptions and their output in build logs.
    To mask sensitive output, plugin:workflow-cps[Pipeline: Groovy Plugin] 2.84 and earlier specified an allowlist of known non-sensitive variables and masked everything else.
    This caused problems, so Pipeline: Groovy Plugin 2.85 and newer expects pipeline steps to explicitly specify that variables are to be treated as sensitive and should be removed from output.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.7.0 and earlier relied on the previous behavior and did not explicitly declare variables as sensitive or redacted them.

    This can result in exposure of Vault credentials in Pipeline build logs and Pipeline step descriptions.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.8.0 explicitly masks Vault credentials in build logs and Pipeline step descriptions.

    This fix only applies to new builds.
    Administrators are advised to review build logs and Pipeline metadata files created before PLUGIN_NAME 3.8.0 for the presence of Vault credentials.
