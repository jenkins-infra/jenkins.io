  title: Terrapin SSH vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-48795
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME bundles the https://github.com/jenkinsci/trilead-ssh2/[Jenkins project's fork of the Trilead SSH2 library] for use by other plugins.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.133.vfb_8a_7b_9c5dd1 and earlier, except 2.84.86.vf9c960e9b_458, bundles versions of Jenkins/Trilead SSH2 that are susceptible to https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-48795[CVE-2023-48795] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrapin_attack[Terrapin]).
    This vulnerability allows a machine-in-the-middle attacker to reduce the security of an SSH connection.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.141.v284120fd0c46 updates the bundled Jenkins/Trilead SSH2 library to version `build-217-jenkins-274.276.v58da_75159cb_7`, which by default removes the affected ciphers and encryption modes.

  title: Improper input sanitization in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2024-28149

  description: |-
    link:/security/advisory/2018-04-16/#SECURITY-784[SECURITY-784 / CVE-20218-1000175] is a path traversal vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME 1.15 and earlier.
    The fix for it retained compatibility for older reports as a fallback.

    In PLUGIN_NAME 1.16 through 1.32 (both inclusive) this fallback for reports created in PLUGIN_NAME 1.15 and earlier does not properly sanitize input.
    This allows attackers with Item/Configure permission to do the following:

    * Implement stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
    * Determine whether a path on the Jenkins controller file system exists, without being able to access it.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.32.1 removes support for reports created before PLUGIN_NAME 1.15.
    Those reports are retained on disk, but may no longer be accessible through the Jenkins UI.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.32 and earlier does not escape job names, report names, and index page titles shown as part of the report frame.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.32.1 escapes job names, report names, and index page titles when creating a new report.
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.32.1 checks reports created in earlier releases for the presence of unsafe characters in the report frame, and refuses to show these frames if unsafe characters are identified.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.32 and earlier archives invalid symbolic links in report directories on agents and recreates them on the controller.
    Attackers with Item/Configure permission can use them to determine whether a path on the Jenkins controller file system exists, without being able to access it.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.32.1 does not archive symbolic links.

  title: Incorrect trust policy behavior for pull requests from forks in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2024-28152
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L
  description: |-
    Multibranch Pipelines with Bitbucket branch source can be configured to discover pull requests from forks.
    The trust policy is set to "Forks in the same account" by default.

    In PLUGIN_NAME 866.vdea_7dcd3008e and earlier, except 848.850.v6a_a_2a_234a_c81, this trust policy allows changes to Jenkinsfiles from users without write access to the project when using Bitbucket Server.
    This allows attackers able to submit pull requests from forks to change the Pipeline behavior.

    In PLUGIN_NAME 871.v28d74e8b_4226, the "Forks in the same account" trust policy does not extend trust to Jenkinsfiles modified by users without write access to the project.

    NOTE: Pipelines using Bitbucket Cloud are unaffected by this issue.

    PLUGIN_NAME 5.4.5 and earlier does not escape vulnerability metadata from Dependency-Check reports on the Jenkins UI.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control workspace contents or CVE metadata.

    PLUGIN_NAME 5.4.6 escapes vulnerability metadata from Dependency-Check reports.

  title: Sensitive information exposure in build logs by PLUGIN_NAME

    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME has a global option to log the JSON payload it sends to RabbitMQ in the build log.
    This includes the build parameters, some of which may be sensitive, and they are not masked.

    In PLUGIN_NAME 1.4.0 and earlier, this option is enabled by default.
    This results in unwanted exposure of sensitive information in build logs.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.4.1 disables the global option to log the JSON payload it sends to RabbitMQ by default.
    This option is disabled when updating from a previous release and needs to be re-enabled by administrators who want to use this feature.

    PLUGIN_NAME provides a global option for administrators to enable or disable SSL/TLS certificate validation for Data Control Tower (DCT) connections.

    In PLUGIN_NAME 3.0.1 this option is set to disable SSL/TLS certificate validation by default.

    In PLUGIN_NAME 3.0.2 this option is set to enable SSL/TLS certificate validation by default.

    NOTE: PLUGIN_NAME 3.0.2 inverts the semantics of the existing option.
    Administrators who update from version 3.0.1 to 3.0.2 will need to toggle this option to have the previously configured behavior.

    PLUGIN_NAME provides a global option for administrators to enable or disable SSL/TLS certificate validation for Data Control Tower (DCT) connections.

    In PLUGIN_NAME 3.0.1 through 3.1.0 (both inclusive) an option change from disabled validation to enabled validation fails to take effect until Jenkins is restarted.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.1.1 applies the configuration change immediately when switching from disabled validation to enabled validation.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.11 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint implementing a connection test.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified TCP or Unix socket URL.
    Additionally, the plugin reconfigures itself using the provided connection test parameters, affecting future build step executions.

    Additionally, this endpoint does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
