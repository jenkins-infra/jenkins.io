  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21699
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.5.6 and earlier does not escape the parameter name of reactive parameters and dynamic reference parameters.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.5.7 escapes references to parameter names.

  - name: uno-choice
    previous: 2.5.6
    fixed: 2.5.7

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21700
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 3.3 and earlier does not escape the name of scripts on the UI when asking to confirm their deletion.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to create Scriptler scripts.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.4 escapes the name of scripts on the UI when asking to confirm their deletion.
  plugins:
  - name: scriptler

  title: XXE vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21701
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 3.20 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

    This allows attackers able to control workspace contents to have Jenkins parse a crafted XML report file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

  title: XXE vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-43576
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.2 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read and Item/Read permissions to have Jenkins parse a crafted XML file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 5.1.1 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

    This allows attackers able to control workspace contents to have Jenkins parse a crafted XML file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

  title: Agent-to-controller security bypass in PLUGIN_NAME allows writing arbitrary files
  cve: CVE-2021-43578
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.0.0 and earlier implements an agent-to-controller message that does not implement any validation of its input.

    This allows attackers able to control agent processes to replace arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system with an attacker-controlled JSON string.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
