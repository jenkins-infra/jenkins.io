- id: SECURITY-915
  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in GitHub Plugin allowed capturing credentials
  reporter: Orange Tsai(@orange_8361) from DEVCORE
  cve: CVE-2018-1000600
  cvss:
    severity: medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
  plugins:
    - name: github
      fixed: 1.29.2
      previous: 1.29.1
  description: |
    A form action method in GitHub Plugin did not check the permission of the user accessing it, allowing anyone with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to cause Jenkins to send a GitHub API request to create an API token to an attacker-specified URL.

    This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

    Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

    The form validation method now requires POST requests and the Overall/Administer permission.

  title: Arbitrary file read vulnerability in SSH Credentials Plugin with Credentials Binding Plugin
  reporter: Jesse Glick, CloudBees, Inc.
  cve: CVE-2018-1000601
  cvss:
    severity: medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
  plugins:
    - name: ssh-credentials
      fixed: 1.14
      previous: 1.13
  description: |
    SSH Credentials Plugin allowed the creation of SSH credentials with keys "From a file on Jenkins controller".
    Credentials Binding Plugin 1.13 and newer allows binding SSH credentials to environment variables.
    In combination, these two features allow users with the permission to configure a job to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller by creating an SSH credential referencing an arbitrary file on the Jenkins controller, and binding it to an environment variable in a job.

    SSH Credentials Plugin no longer supports SSH credentials from files on the Jenkins controller file system, neither user-specified file paths nor `~/.ssh`.
    Existing SSH credentials of these kinds are migrated to "directly entered" SSH credentials.

    NOTE: If plugin:blueocean[Blue Ocean] is installed, it needs to be updated to 1.5.1 or 1.6.1, or the creation of pipelines for plain Git will not work anymore after installing the fix for this issue.

  title: HTTP session fixation vulnerability in SAML Plugin
  cve: CVE-2018-1000602
  cvss:
    severity: medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
  plugins:
    - name: saml
      fixed: 1.0.7
      previous: 1.0.6
  description: |
    SAML Plugin did not invalidate the previous session and create a new one upon successful login, allowing attackers able to control or obtain another user's pre-login session ID to impersonate them.

    SAML Plugin now invalidates the previous session during login and creates a new one.

  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Openstack Cloud Plugin allowed capturing credentials
  reporter: Thomas de Grenier de Latour
  cve: CVE-2018-1000603
  cvss:
    severity: medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
  plugins:
    - name: openstack-cloud
      fixed: 2.36
      previous: 2.35
  description: |
    Openstack Cloud Plugin did not perform permission checks on methods implementing form validation.
    This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins, and to cause Jenkins to submit HTTP requests to attacker-specified URLs.

    Additionally, these form validation methods did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

    These form validation methods now require POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions.

  title: AWS CodeDeploy Plugin persisted possibly sensitive environment variables in job configuration
  reporter: Oleg Nenashev, CloudBees, Inc.
  cve: CVE-2018-1000402
  cvss:
    severity: medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  plugins:
    - name: codedeploy
      fixed: "1.20"
      previous: 1.19
  description: |
    AWS CodeDeploy Plugin could persist environment variables from the last run of any project with the post-build step configured in the job's `config.xml` file.

    In some cases, this allowed users with file system access or Extended Read permission to obtain those potentially sensitive environment variables by accessing the project's `config.xml`.

    AWS CodeDeploy Plugin 1.20 and newer no longer stores build environment variables on disk.
    Existing job `config.xml` will retain the stored environment variables until the job configuration is saved again.

  title: AWS CodeDeploy Plugin stored AWS Secret Key in plain text
  reporter: Viktor Gazdag
  cve: CVE-2018-1000403
  cvss:
    severity: medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  plugins:
    - name: codedeploy
      fixed: "1.20"
      previous: 1.19
  description: |
    AWS CodeDeploy Plugin stored the AWS Secret Key in its configuration unencrypted in jobs' `config.xml` files and its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller.
    This key could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission, or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

    While masked from view using a password form field, the AWS Secret Key was transferred in plain text to users when accessing the job configuration form.

    AWS CodeDeploy Plugin 1.20 and newer stores the AWS Secret Key encrypted in the configuration files on disk and no longer transfers it to users viewing the configuration form in plain text.
    Existing jobs need to have their configuration saved for existing plain text secret keys to be overwritten.

  title: CollabNet Plugin globally and unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation
  reporter: Daniel Beck, CloudBees, Inc.
  cve: CVE-2018-1000605
  cvss:
    severity: medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
  plugins:
    - name: collabnet
      fixed: 2.0.5
      previous: 2.0.4
  description: |
    CollabNet Plugin disabled SSL/TLS certificate validation for the entire Jenkins controller JVM by default.

    CollabNet Plugin 2.0.5 and newer no longer does that.
    It instead requires users to opt in to disabling SSL/TLS certificate validation by setting the system property `hudson.plugins.collabnet.CollabNetPlugin.skipSslValidation` to `true`.
    This feature applies to connections by this plugin only.

      fixed: 0.42
      previous: 0.41
  description: |
    A form validation method in URLTrigger Plugin did not check the permission of the user accessing them, allowing anyone with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to cause Jenkins to send a GET request to a specified URL.

    Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

    This form validation method now no longer connects to a user provided URL.
