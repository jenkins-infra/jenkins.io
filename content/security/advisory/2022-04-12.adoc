  description: |-
    Multiple plugins do not escape the name and description of the parameter types they provide:

    * Credentials Plugin 1111.v35a_307992395 and earlier (SECURITY-2690 / CVE-2022-29036)
    * CVS Plugin 2.19 and earlier (SECURITY-2700 / CVE-2022-29037)
    * Extended Choice Parameter Plugin 346.vd87693c5a_86c and earlier (SECURITY-2704 / CVE-2022-29038)
    * Gerrit Trigger Plugin 2.35.2 and earlier (SECURITY-2703 / CVE-2022-29039)
    * Git Parameter Plugin 0.9.15 and earlier (SECURITY-2699 / CVE-2022-29040)
    * Jira Plugin 3.7 and earlier (SECURITY-2691 / CVE-2022-29041)
    * Job Generator 1.22 and earlier (SECURITY-2263 / CVE-2022-29042)
    * Mask Passwords Plugin 3.0 and earlier (SECURITY-2701 / CVE-2022-29043)
    * Node and Label parameter Plugin 1.10.3 and earlier (SECURITY-2702 / CVE-2022-29044)
    * promoted builds Plugin 873.v6149db_d64130 and earlier (SECURITY-2692 / CVE-2022-29045)
    * Subversion Plugin 2.15.3 and earlier (SECURITY-2698 / CVE-2022-29046)

    This results in stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.

    Exploitation of these vulnerabilities requires that parameters are listed on another page, like the "Build With Parameters" and "Parameters" pages provided by Jenkins (core), and that those pages are not hardened to prevent exploitation.
    Jenkins (core) has prevented exploitation of vulnerabilities of this kind on the "Build With Parameters" and "Parameters" pages since 2.44 and LTS 2.32.2 as part of the link:/security/advisory/2017-02-01/#persisted-cross-site-scripting-vulnerability-in-parameter-names-and-descriptions[SECURITY-353 / CVE-2017-2601] fix.
    Additionally, the following plugins have been updated to list parameters in a way that prevents exploitation by default.

    * plugin:m2release[Maven Release Plugin] 0.16.3 (SECURITY-2669)
    * plugin:pipeline-build-step[Pipeline: Build Step Plugin] 2.17 and 2.15.2 (SECURITY-2611)
    * plugin:pipeline-input-step[Pipeline: Input Step Plugin] 447.v95e5a_6e3502a_ and 2.12.1 (SECURITY-2674)
    * plugin:promoted-builds[promoted builds Plugin] 876.v99d29788b_36b_ and 3.10.1 (SECURITY-2670)
    * plugin:rebuild[Rebuilder Plugin] 1.33.1 (SECURITY-2671)
    * plugin:release[Release Plugin] 2.14 (SECURITY-2672)

    Older releases of these plugins allow exploitation of the vulnerabilities listed above.

    As of publication of this advisory, the following plugins have not yet been updated to list parameters in a way that prevents exploitation of these vulnerabilities:

    * plugin:coordinator[Coordinator Plugin] (SECURITY-2668)
    * plugin:show-build-parameters[Show Build Parameters Plugin] (SECURITY-2325)
    * plugin:unleash[Unleash Maven Plugin] (SECURITY-2673)

    These are not vulnerabilities in these plugins.
    Only plugins defining parameter types can be considered to be vulnerable to this issue.

    NOTE: Some plugins both define parameter types and implement a page listing parameters, so they can appear in multiple lists and may have both a security fix and a security hardening applied.

    The following plugins have been updated to escape the name and description of the parameter types they provide in the versions specified:

    * Credentials Plugin 1112.vc87b_7a_3597f6, 1087.1089.v2f1b_9a_b_040e4, 1074.1076.v39c30cecb_0e2, and 2.6.1.1
    * CVS Plugin 2.19.1
    * Gerrit Trigger Plugin 2.35.3
    * Git Parameter Plugin 0.9.16
    * Jira Plugin 3.7.1 and 3.6.1
    * Mask Passwords Plugin 3.1
    * Node and Label parameter Plugin 1.10.3.1
    * promoted builds Plugin 876.v99d29788b_36b_ and 3.10.1
    * Subversion Plugin 2.15.4

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix available for the following plugins:

    * Extended Choice Parameter Plugin (SECURITY-2704 / CVE-2022-29038)
    * Job Generator (SECURITY-2263 / CVE-2022-29042)

  title: Untrusted users can modify some Pipeline libraries in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2022-29047
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L
  description: |-
    Multibranch Pipelines by default limit who can change the Pipeline definition from the Jenkinsfile.
    This is useful for SCMs like GitHub:
    Jenkins can build content from users without commit access, but who can submit pull requests, without granting them the ability to modify the Pipeline definition.
    In that case, Jenkins will just use the Pipeline definition in the pull request's destination branch instead.

    In PLUGIN_NAME 564.ve62a_4eb_b_e039 and earlier the same protection does not apply to uses of the `library` step with a `retriever` argument pointing to a library in the current build's repository and branch (e.g., `library(â€¦, retriever: legacySCM(scm))`).
    This allows attackers able to submit pull requests (or equivalent), but not able to commit directly to the configured SCM, to effectively change the Pipeline behavior by changing the library behavior in their pull request, even if the Pipeline is configured to not trust them.

    PLUGIN_NAME 566.vd0a_a_3334a_555 and 2.21.3 aborts library retrieval if the library would be retrieved from the same repository and revision as the current build, and the revision being built is untrusted.

  title: CSRF vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2022-29048

    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.15.3 and earlier does not require POST requests for several form validation methods, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.

    These vulnerabilities allow attackers to connect to an attacker-specified URL.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.15.4 requires POST requests for the affected form validation methods.

  - name: subversion
    previous: 2.15.3

  title: Promotion names in PLUGIN_NAME are not validated when using Job DSL
  cve: CVE-2022-29049
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME provides dedicated support for defining promotions using plugin:job-dsl[Job DSL Plugin].

    PLUGIN_NAME 873.v6149db_d64130 and earlier does not validate the names of promotions defined in Job DSL.
    This allows attackers with Job/Configure permission to create a promotion with an unsafe name.
    As a result, the promotion name could be used for cross-site scripting (XSS) or to replace other `config.xml` files.

    PLUGIN_NAME 876.v99d29788b_36b_ and 3.10.1 validates the name of promotions.
  plugins:
  - name: promoted-builds
    previous: 873.v6149db_d64130

  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2022-29050 (CSRF), CVE-2022-29051 (missing permission check)

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.16 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods implementing form validation.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an FTP server using attacker-specified credentials.

    Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.17 requires POST requests and appropriate permissions for the affected form validation methods.

  title: Private key stored in plain text by PLUGIN_NAME

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 4.3.8 and earlier stores private keys unencrypted in cloud agent `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

    These private keys can be viewed by users with Agent/Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

    PLUGIN_NAME 4.3.9 stores private keys encrypted.
  plugins:
  - name: google-compute-engine
    previous: 4.3.8
    fixed: 4.3.9
