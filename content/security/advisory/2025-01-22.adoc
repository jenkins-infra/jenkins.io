  title: Incorrect permission check in PLUGIN_NAME allows enumerating credentials
    IDs
  cve: CVE-2025-24397
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.9.6 and earlier does not correctly perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

    This allows attackers with global Item/Configure permission (while lacking Item/Configure permission on any particular job) to enumerate credential IDs of GitLab API token credentials and Secret text credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

    An enumeration of credential IDs in PLUGIN_NAME 1.9.7 requires Overall/Administer permission.
  plugins:
  - name: gitlab-plugin
    previous: 1.9.6
    fixed: 1.9.7

  title: PLUGIN_NAME allows bypassing CSRF protection for any URL
  cve: CVE-2025-24398
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    An extension point in Jenkins allows selectively disabling cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection for specific URLs.
    PLUGIN_NAME implements this extension point to support OAuth 1.0 authentication.

    In PLUGIN_NAME 2.1.0 through 4.1.3 (both inclusive) this implementation is too permissive, allowing attackers to craft URLs that would bypass the CSRF protection of any target URL.

    PLUGIN_NAME 4.1.4 restricts which URLs it disables cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection for to the URLs that needs it.

  title: Improper handling of case sensitivity in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2025-24399
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 4.452.v2849b_d3945fa_ and earlier, except 4.438.440.v3f5f201de5dc, treats usernames as case-insensitive.

    On a Jenkins instance configured with a case-sensitive OpenID Connect provider, this allows attackers to log in as any user by providing a username that differs only in letter case, potentially gaining administrator access to Jenkins.

    PLUGIN_NAME 4.453.v4d7765c854f4 introduces an advanced configuration option to manage username case sensitivity, with default to case-sensitive.

    NOTE: Upgrading to the fixed version does not modify the default behavior from case-insensitive to case-sensitive.
    To enable case-sensitivity, this must be explicitly configured in the plugin settings.
  plugins:
  - name: oic-auth
    previous: 4.452.v2849b_d3945fa_

  title: Tokens stored in plain text by PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2025-0142
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.3 and earlier stores Zoom integration tokens unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

    These tokens can be viewed by users with Item/Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.4 stores Zoom integration tokens encrypted once job configurations are saved again.
  plugins:
  - name: zoom
    previous: '1.3'
    fixed: '1.4'
- id: SECURITY-3292 (2)
  title: Tokens displayed without masking by PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2025-0148
  cvss:
    severity: Low
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME requires Zoom integration tokens for Zoom Build Notifier post-build actions.

    In PLUGIN_NAME 1.5 and earlier the job configuration form does not mask these tokens, increasing the potential for attackers to observe and capture them.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.6 masks Zoom integration tokens displayed on the job configuration form.

  - name: zoom
    previous: '1.5'
    fixed: '1.6'

  title: Cache confusion in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2025-24400
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME allows events published to RabbitMQ to be signed using certificate credentials.
    To improve performance, the plugin caches some data from the credential.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.8.0 through 2.10.2 (both inclusive) uses the credential ID as the cache key.
    This allows attackers able to create a credential with the same ID as a legitimate one in a different credentials store, to sign an event published to RabbitMQ with the legitimate certificate credentials.

    NOTE: Signing is disabled by default, only instances explicitly configured to enable it are affected.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.10.3 removes the cache.

  - name: eiffel-broadcaster
    previous: 2.10.2

  title: Disabled permissions can be granted by PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2025-24401
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 217.vd5b_18537403e and earlier does not verify that permissions configured to be granted are enabled.
    This may allow users formerly granted (typically optional permissions, like Overall/Manage) to access functionality they're no longer entitled to.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2025-24402 (CSRF), CVE-2025-24403 (missing permission check)
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.6 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials IDs of Azure credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

    Additionally, those HTTP endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability, allowing attackers to connect to a previously configured Service Fabric URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
