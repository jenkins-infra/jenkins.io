  title: XXE vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-37942
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 206.v9a_94ff0b_4a_10 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

    This allows attackers with Item/Build permission to have Jenkins parse a crafted HTTP request with XML data that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

    PLUGIN_NAME 207.v98a_a_37a_85525 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME allows testing a new, unsaved configuration by performing a connection test (the button labeled "Test Domain").

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.30 and earlier ignores the "Require TLS" and "StartTls" options and always performs the connection test to Active directory unencrypted.
    This allows attackers able to capture network traffic between the Jenkins controller and Active Directory servers to obtain Active Directory credentials.

    NOTE: This only affects the connection test. Connections established during the login process are encrypted if the corresponding TLS option is enabled.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.30.1 considers the "Require TLS" and "StartTls" options for connection tests.

  title: Missing permission check in PLUGIN_NAME allows capturing credentials

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 5.4.1 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

    PLUGIN_NAME 5.4.2 requires Overall/Administer permission to access the affected HTTP endpoint.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.3.0 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to download a string representation of the current security realm (Java `Object#toString()`), which potentially includes sensitive information.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.3.1 requires Overall/Administer permission to access the affected HTTP endpoint, and only allows downloading a string representation if the current security realm is this plugin's.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.1.0.227.v27e08dfb_1a_20 and earlier does not invalidate the existing session on login.

    This allows attackers to use social engineering techniques to gain administrator access to Jenkins.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.1.0.230.v5d7030b_f5432 invalidates the existing session on login.
  plugins:
  - name: openshift-login

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.1.0.227.v27e08dfb_1a_20 and earlier improperly determines that a redirect URL after login is legitimately pointing to Jenkins.

    This allows attackers to perform phishing attacks by having users go to a Jenkins URL that will forward them to a different site after successful authentication.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.1.0.230.v5d7030b_f5432 only redirects to relative (Jenkins) URLs.

  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.0.16 and earlier does not perform SSH host key validation when connecting to OCI clouds.

    This lack of validation could be abused using a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept these connections to OCI clouds.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.0.17 provides strategies for performing host key validation for administrators to select the one that meets their security needs.

    For more information see https://github.com/jenkinsci/oracle-cloud-infrastructure-compute-plugin#add-oci-template[the plugin documentation].

    NOTE: The Jenkins security team has been unable to confirm the exploitability and resolution of this vulnerability.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 0.0.46 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.
    Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

    An enumeration of credentials IDs in PLUGIN_NAME 0.0.47 requires the appropriate permissions.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 0.0.46 and earlier does not set the appropriate context for credentials lookup, allowing the use of System-scoped credentials otherwise reserved for the global configuration.

    This allows attackers with Item/Configure permission to access and capture credentials they are not entitled to.

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.0.47 defines the appropriate context for credentials lookup.

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.0.46 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

    Additionally, these HTTP endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.0.47 requires POST requests and the appropriate permissions for the affected HTTP endpoints.
