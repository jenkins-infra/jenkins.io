  title: PLUGIN_NAME stored webhook endpoint token in plain text
  cve: CVE-2019-10459
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    Mattermost allows the definition of incoming (from the perspective of the service) webhook URLs.
    These contain what is effectively a secret token as part of the URL.

    PLUGIN_NAME stored these webhook URLs as part of its global configuration file `jenkins.plugins.mattermost.MattermostNotifier.xml` and job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller.
    These URLs could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission (in the case of job `config.xml` files) or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

    PLUGIN_NAME now stores these URLs encrypted.
    As they combine configuration and secret token, they are still shown on the UI.

    PLUGIN_NAME stored a credential unencrypted in the global `config.xml` configuration file on the Jenkins controller.
    This credential could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

    PLUGIN_NAME now stores this credential encrypted.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME stored a credential unencrypted in its global configuration file `jenkins.plugins.zulip.ZulipNotifier.xml`, as well as in the legacy configuration file `hudson.plugins.humbug.HumbugNotifier.xml` on the Jenkins controller.
    This credential could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

    PLUGIN_NAME now stores this credential encrypted in its global configuration file.
    The legacy configuration file is deleted when saving the plugin configuration.

    PLUGIN_NAME stored a credential unencrypted in its global configuration file `com.dynatrace.jenkins.dashboard.TAGlobalConfiguration.xml` on the Jenkins controller.
    This credential could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

  title: CSRF vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2019-10462
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME did not require POST requests on a method implementing form validation.
    This CSRF vulnerability allowed attackers to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server with attacker-specified username and password.

    PLUGIN_NAME now requires POST requests for this form validation method.
  plugins:
  - name: dynatrace-dashboard
    previous: 2.1.3
    fixed: 2.1.4

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
    This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server with attacker-specified username and password.

# Plugins with unfixed issues

  reporter: Thomas de Grenier de Latour
  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2019-10464 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10465 (permission check)
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
    This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to send an HTTP HEAD request to a user-specified URL, or confirm the existence of any file or directory on the Jenkins controller.

    Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
  plugins:
  - name: weblogic-deployer-plugin

  reporter: Thomas de Grenier de Latour
  title: XXE vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2019-10466
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME accepts XML for part of its configuration.
    It does not configure the XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

    A form validation method that accepts XML does not perform permission checks.
    This allows users with Overall/Read permission to have Jenkins parse a crafted XML file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins agent, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME stores a credential unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller if the 'Override Credentials' option is used.
    This credential can be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME allowed capturing credentials
  cve: CVE-2019-10468 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10469 (permission check)
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
    This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

    Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

  title: Users with Overall/Read access could enumerate credential IDs in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2019-10470
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

    This functionality does not correctly check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
    Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
    This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified SSH server using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.
