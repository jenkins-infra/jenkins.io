  title: Improper masking of credentials in multiple plugins
  cve: CVE-2023-30513 (Kubernetes), CVE-2023-30514 (Azure Key Vault), CVE-2023-30515
    (Thycotic DevOps Secrets Vault)
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    Multiple plugins do not properly mask (i.e., replace with asterisks) credentials printed in the build log from Pipeline steps like `sh` and `bat`, when both of the following conditions are met:

    * The credentials are printed in build steps executing on an agent (typically inside a `node` block).
    * Push mode for durable task logging is enabled.
      This is a hidden option in https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-durable-task-step/[Pipeline: Nodes and Processes] that can be enabled through the https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/system-properties/[Java system property] `org.jenkinsci.plugins.workflow.steps.durable_task.DurableTaskStep.USE_WATCHING`.
      It is also automatically enabled by some plugins, e.g., https://plugins.jenkins.io/opentelemetry/[OpenTelemetry] and https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-cloudwatch-logs/[Pipeline Logging over CloudWatch].

    The following plugins are affected by this vulnerability:

    * Kubernetes 3909.v1f2c633e8590 and earlier (SECURITY-3079 / CVE-2023-30513)
    * Azure Key Vault 187.va_cd5fecd198a_ and earlier (SECURITY-3051 / CVE-2023-30514)
    * Thycotic DevOps Secrets Vault 1.0.0 (SECURITY-3078 / CVE-2023-30515)

    The following plugins have been updated to properly mask credentials in the build log when push mode for durable task logging is enabled:

    * Kubernetes 3910.ve59cec5e33ea_ (SECURITY-3079 / CVE-2023-30513)
    * Azure Key Vault 188.vf46b_7fa_846a_1 (SECURITY-3051 / CVE-2023-30514)

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix available for the following plugin:

    * Thycotic DevOps Secrets Vault 1.0.0 (SECURITY-3078 / CVE-2023-30515)

    NOTE: An improvement in https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials-binding/[Credentials Binding] 523.525.vb_72269281873 implements a workaround that applies build log masking even in affected plugins.
    This workaround is temporary and potentially incomplete, so it is still recommended that affected plugins be updated to resolve this issue.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.0 improperly introduces an option to opt out of SSL/TLS certificate validation when connecting to Docker registries.

    Job configurations using Image Tag Parameters that were created before 2.0 will have SSL/TLS certificate validation disabled by default.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.0.2 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.
    Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.
