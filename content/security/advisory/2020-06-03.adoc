  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2190
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.72 and earlier does not correctly escape pending or approved classpath entries on the In-process Script Approval page.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure sandboxed scripts.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.73 escapes pending and approved classpath entries before rendering them in the Jenkins UI.

  - name: script-security

  title: CSRF vulnerability and improper permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2191 (permission checks), CVE-2020-2192 (CSRF)
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME adds API endpoints to add or remove agent labels.
    In PLUGIN_NAME 3.20 and earlier these only require a global Swarm secret to use, and no regular permission check is performed.
    This allows users with Agent/Create permission to add or remove labels of any agent.

    Additionally, these API endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.21 requires POST requests and Agent/Configure permission for the affected agent to these endpoints.
    It no longer uses the global Swarm secret for these API endpoints.

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 4.7.0-3 and earlier does not escape the parser identifier when rendering charts.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited by users with Job/Configure permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME 4.7.0-4 escapes the parser identifier.

  - name: echarts-api
    previous: 4.7.0-3
    fixed: 4.7.0-4

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2194

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 4.7.0-3 and earlier does not escape the display name of the builds in the trend chart.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited by users with Run/Update permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME 4.7.0-4 escapes the display name.

  - name: echarts-api

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2195
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.11 and earlier displays the unprocessed job description in tooltips.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability that can be exploited by users with Job/Configure permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.12 applies the configured markup formatter to the job description shown in tooltips.

  - name: compact-columns
    previous: '1.11'
    fixed: '1.12'

  title: Complete lack of CSRF protection in PLUGIN_NAME can lead to OS command injection
  cve: CVE-2020-2196
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 3.141.59 and earlier has no CSRF protection for its HTTP endpoints.

    This allows attackers to perform the following actions:

    * Restart the Selenium Grid hub.
    * Delete or replace the plugin configuration.
    * Start, stop, or restart Selenium configurations on specific nodes.

    Through carefully chosen configuration parameters, these actions can result in OS command injection on the Jenkins master.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

  title: Missing permission check in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2197 (permission check), CVE-2020-2198 (unredacted encrypted secrets)
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    Jenkins limits access to job configuration XML data (`config.xml`) to users with Job/ExtendedRead permission, typically implied by Job/Configure permission.
    PLUGIN_NAME has several job inspection features, including the API URL `/job/.../getConfigAsXML` for its Inheritance Project job type that does something similar.

    PLUGIN_NAME 19.08.02 and earlier does not check permissions for this new endpoint, granting access to job configuration XML data to every user with Job/Read permission.

    Additionally, the encrypted values of secrets stored in the job configuration are not redacted, as they would be by the `config.xml` API for users without Job/Configure permission.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

  - name: project-inheritance

  title: XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2199
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.0.1 and earlier does not escape the error message for the repository URL field form validation.

    This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can also be exploited similar to a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability by users with Job/Configure permission.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
  plugins:
  - name: svn-partial-release-mgr
    previous: 1.0.1

  title: OS command injection vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2200
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    A form validation endpoint in PLUGIN_NAME executes the `play` command to validate a given input file.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.0.2 and earlier lets users specify the path to the `play` command on the Jenkins master.
    This results in an OS command injection vulnerability exploitable by users able to store such a file on the Jenkins master (e.g. through archiving artifacts).

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
  plugins:
  - name: play-autotest-plugin
    title: Play Framework
