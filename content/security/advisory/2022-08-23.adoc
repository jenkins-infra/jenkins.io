  title: Improper masking of credentials in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2022-38663
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 4.11.4 and earlier does not properly mask (i.e., replace with asterisks) credentials in the build log provided by the Git Username and Password (`gitUsernamePassword`) credentials binding.
    Usernames are masked instead of passwords in cases when usernames are not set to be treated as secret.

    PLUGIN_NAME 4.11.5 properly masks credentials in the build log provided by the Git Username and Password (`gitUsernamePassword`) credentials binding.
    As a side effect of the fix, usernames currently set to be not masked will lose their current (unintentional) masking.
  plugins:
  - name: git
    previous: 4.11.4
    fixed: 4.11.5

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2022-38664
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1165.v8cc9fd1f4597 and earlier does not escape the job name on the System Configuration History page.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to configure job names.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1166.vc9f255f45b_8a escapes the job name on the System Configuration History page.

  title: RabbitMQ password stored in plain text by PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2022-38665
  cvss:
    severity: Low
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.0.8 and earlier stores a RabbitMQ password unencrypted in its global configuration file `hudson.plugins.collabnet.share.TeamForgeShare.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

    This password can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.0.9 no longer includes the EventQ feature that accepts RabbitMQ credentials.
    The RabbitMQ password will be removed from the configuration file once it is saved again.
  plugins:
  - name: collabnet
    previous: 2.0.8
    fixed: 2.0.9

  title: RCE vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-25738
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.3.1 and earlier bundles a version of Kubernetes Java Client library with the vulnerability https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-25738[CVE-2021-25738] that does not configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types.

    This results in a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to provide YAML input files to PLUGIN_NAME's build step.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
