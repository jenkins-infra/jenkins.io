  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in PLUGIN_NAME allowed capturing credentials
  cve: CVE-2019-10340 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10341 (permission check)
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
    This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

    Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

    This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer or Item/Configure permission, as appropriate.

  title: Users with Overall/Read access could enumerate credential IDs in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2019-10342
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

    This functionality did not correctly check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
    Those could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

    An enumeration of credentials IDs in this plugin now requires the appropriate permission, typically Overall/Administer or Item/Configure.
