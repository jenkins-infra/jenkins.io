  title: Jenkins accepted cached legacy CLI authentication
  cve: CVE-2019-1003049
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    The fix for https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-01-16/[SECURITY-901] in Jenkins 2.150.2 and 2.160 did not reject existing remoting-based CLI authentication caches.

    This means that users who cached their CLI authentication before Jenkins was updated to 2.150.2 and newer, or 2.160 and newer, would remain authenticated.

    Support for the remoting-based CLI was dropped in Jenkins 2.165, so newer weekly releases are not affected.
    Jenkins 2.164.2 no longer supports legacy CLI authentication caches from before 2.150.2/2.160, and these users will be considered logged out.

  title: XSS vulnerability in form validation button
  cve: CVE-2019-1003050
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    The `f:validateButton` form control for the Jenkins UI did not properly escape job URLs.
    This resulted in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users with the ability to control job names.

    The affected form control has been rewritten to no longer need to escape job URLs.
