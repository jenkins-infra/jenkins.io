  title: XXE vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2022-46682
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.1.11 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

    This allows attackers able to control XML input files for the 'Plot build data' build step to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.1.12 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.
  plugins:
  - name: plot
    previous: 2.1.11
    fixed: 2.1.12

  title: Open redirect vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2022-46683
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.4 through 1.6 (both inclusive) improperly determines that a redirect URL after login is legitimately pointing to Jenkins.

    This allows attackers to perform phishing attacks by having users go to a Jenkins URL that will forward them to a different site after successful authentication.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.7 only redirects to relative (Jenkins) URLs.
  plugins:
  - name: google-login
    previous: '1.6'
    fixed: '1.7'

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2022-46684
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME processes Checkmarx service API responses and generates HTML reports from them for rendering on the Jenkins UI.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2022.3.3 and earlier does not escape values returned from the Checkmarx service API before inserting them into HTML reports.
    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

    NOTE: While Jenkins users without Overall/Administer permission are not allowed to configure the URL to the Checkmarx service, this could still be exploited via man-in-the-middle attacks.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2022.4.3 escapes values returned from the Checkmarx service API before inserting them into HTML reports.
  plugins:
  - name: checkmarx
    previous: 2022.3.3
    fixed: 2022.4.3

  title: Improper credentials masking in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2022-46685
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME support authentication with Gitea personal access tokens.

    In PLUGIN_NAME 1.4.4 and earlier, the implementation of these tokens did not support credentials masking.
    This can expose Gitea personal access tokens in the build log, e.g., when printed as part of repository URLs.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.4.5 adds support for masking of Gitea personal access tokens.

    Administrators unable to update are advised to use SSH checkout instead.
  plugins:
  - name: gitea
    previous: 1.4.4
    fixed: 1.4.5

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.79.vc095ccc85094 and earlier does not escape property values and build display names on the Custom Build Properties and Build Summary pages.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to set or change these values.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.82.v16d5b_d3590c7 escapes property values and build display names on the Custom Build Properties and Build Summary pages.
  plugins:
  - name: custom-build-properties
    previous: 2.79.vc095ccc85094
    fixed: 2.82.v16d5b_d3590c7

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.0.0 and earlier does not escape build display names shown on the Spring Config view.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to change build display names.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.0.1 escapes build display names shown on the Spring Config view.
  plugins:
  - name: spring-config
    previous: 2.0.0

  title: CSRF vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2022-46688
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 377.v8f3808963dc5 and earlier does not require POST requests for an HTTP endpoint, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    This allows attackers to have Jenkins connect to Gerrit servers (previously configured by Jenkins administrators) using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, potentially capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
