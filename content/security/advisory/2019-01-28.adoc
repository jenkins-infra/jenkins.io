  title: Sandbox Bypass in Script Security Plugin
  reporter: Mikhail Egorov, security researcher, https://twitter.com/0ang3el
  cve: CVE-2019-1003005
  cvss:
    severity: high
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  plugins:
    - name: script-security
      fixed: "1.51"
      previous: "1.50"
  description: |
    Script Security sandbox protection could be circumvented during the script compilation phase by applying AST transforming annotations such as `@Grab` to source code elements.

    This affected an HTTP endpoint used to validate a user-submitted Groovy script that was not covered in the link:../2019-01-08/#SECURITY-1266[2019-01-08 fix for SECURITY-1266] and allowed users with Overall/Read permission to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller.

    The affected HTTP endpoint now applies a safe Groovy compiler configuration prohibiting unsafe AST transforming annotations.

      previous: "5.0.0"
  description: |
    Warnings Plugin has a form validation HTTP endpoint used to validate a user-submitted Groovy script through compilation, which was not subject to sandbox protection.
    The endpoint checked for the Overall/RunScripts permission, but did not require POST requests, so it was vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
    This allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller by applying AST transforming annotations such as `@Grab` to source code elements.

    The affected HTTP endpoint now applies a safe Groovy compiler configuration preventing the use of unsafe AST transforming annotations.
    Additionally, the form validation HTTP endpoint now requires that requests be sent via POST to prevent CSRF.

  title: Improper certificate validation with StartTLS in Active Directory Plugin
  reporter: Chris Jacobs, Comscore, Inc., Systems Engineer
  cve: CVE-2019-1003009
  cvss:
    severity: high
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
  plugins:
    - name: active-directory
      fixed: "2.11"
      previous: "2.10"
  description: |
    Active Directory Plugin performs TLS upgrade (StartTLS) after connecting to domain controllers through insecure LDAP.
    In this mode, certificates were not properly validated, effectively trusting all certificates, allowing man-in-the-middle attacks.

    This only affected TLS upgrades.
    The LDAPS mode, available by setting the system property `hudson.plugins.active_directory.ActiveDirectorySecurityRealm.forceLdaps` to `true`, was unaffected.

    The plugin now properly validates certificates according to the TLS trust configuration when performing a TLS upgrade.

  title: Recursive token expansion results in information disclosure and DoS in Token Macro Plugin
  reporter: Andy Caldwell and Chris Swindle, Metaswitch Networks
  cve: CVE-2019-1003011
  cvss:
    severity: medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
  plugins:
    - name: token-macro
      fixed: "2.6"
      previous: "2.5"
  description: |
    Token Macro Plugin recursively applied token expansion.

    This could be used by users able to affect input to token expansion (such as change log messages), to inject additional tokens into the input, which would then be expanded, resulting in information disclosure (for example values of environment variables), or denial of service.

    Most tokens have been changed to no longer recursively apply token expansion.

  title: XXE vulnerability in Job Import Plugin
  reporter: Thomas Chauchefoin and Julien Szlamowicz of Synacktiv
  cve: CVE-2019-1003015
  cvss:
    severity: high
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L
  plugins:
    - name: job-import-plugin
      fixed: "3.0" # originally released 2018-05-30
      previous: "2.1"
  description: |
    Job Import Plugin allows to import jobs from other Jenkins instances.
    As a first step in this process, Job Import Plugin sends a request to another Jenkins instance, parsing XML REST API output to obtain a list of jobs that could be imported.

    Job Import Plugin did not configure the XML parser in a way that would prevent XML External Entity (XXE) processing.
    This allowed attackers able to control either the server Jenkins will query, or the URL Jenkins queries, to have it parse a maliciously crafted XML response that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

    External entity resolution has been disabled for the XML parser used in Job Import Plugin 3.0.

- id: SECURITY-905 (2)
  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Job Import Plugin allowed capturing credentials
  reporter: Thomas Chauchefoin and Julien Szlamowicz of Synacktiv
  cve: CVE-2019-1003016
  cvss:
    severity: medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  plugins:
    - name: job-import-plugin
      fixed: "3.0" # originally released 2018-05-30
      previous: "2.1"
  description: |
    Job Import Plugin did not check user permissions on its API endpoint used to access remote Jenkins instances.
        This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

    Job Import Plugin 3.0 will only access Jenkins instances using credentials defined in the global configuration.

- id: SECURITY-1302
  title: CSRF vulnerability in Job Import Plugin allowed creating and overwriting jobs, installing some plugins
  reporter: Daniel Beck, CloudBees, Inc.
  cve: CVE-2019-1003017
  cvss:
    severity: medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L
  plugins:
    - name: job-import-plugin
      fixed: "3.1"
      previous: "3.0"
  description: |
    Job Import Plugin did not require that POST requests are sent to its `/import` URL, which processes requests to import jobs.
    This resulted in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability that could be exploited to create or replace jobs on the local instance if the remote Jenkins instance has different ones with the same name, or to install additional plugins, if jobs on the remote Jenkins instance reference them in their configuration.

    Job Import Plugin 3.0 restricted which remote Jenkins instances jobs can be imported from, limiting how this can be exploited.
    From Job Import Plugin 3.1, the `/import` URL requires that requests are sent via POST.

  cve: CVE-2019-1003018
  cvss:
    severity: low
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  plugins:
    - name: github-oauth
      fixed: "0.31" # originally released 2018-12-07
      previous: "0.29"
  description: |
    GitHub Authentication Plugin stores the client secret in the global Jenkins configuration.

    While the client secret is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form and displayed without masking.
    This could result in exposure of the client secret through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

    GitHub Authentication Plugin now encrypts the client secret transmitted to administrators viewing the global security configuration form.

- id: SECURITY-797
  title: Session fixation vulnerability in GitHub Authentication Plugin

  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in Kanboard Plugin allowed server-side request forgery
  reporter: Thomas de Grenier de Latour
  cve: CVE-2019-1003020
  cvss:
    severity: medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  plugins:
    - name: kanboard
      fixed: "1.5.11" # originally released 2018-09-25
      previous: "1.5.10"
  description: |
    Kanboard Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
    This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to submit a GET request to an attacker-specified URL.

    Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

    This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions.

  title: Monitoring Plugin did not apply CSRF protection even if enabled in Jenkins
  reporter: Daniel Beck, CloudBees, Inc.
  cve: CVE-2019-1003022
  cvss:
    severity: medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L
  plugins:
    - name: monitoring
      fixed: "1.75.0" # originally released 2018-12-09
      previous: "1.74.0"
  description: |
    Monitoring Plugin provides a standalone JavaMelody servlet with an independent CSRF protection configuration.
    Even if Jenkins had CSRF protection enabled, Monitoring Plugin may not have it enabled.

    Monitoring Plugin now checks on startup whether Jenkins has CSRF protection enabled and enables its own CSRF protection accordingly.

    NOTE: Monitoring Plugin does not take into account configuration changes applied after Jenkins startup or after Monitoring Plugin finishes loading.
    Administrators need to restart Jenkins when enabling or disabling the CSRF protection configuration to apply the change to Monitoring Plugin.
