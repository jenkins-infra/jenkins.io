  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21616
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.5.2 and earlier does not escape reference parameter values.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.5.3 escapes reference parameter values.

  - name: uno-choice
    previous: 2.5.2
    fixed: 2.5.3

  title: CSRF vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21617
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:L
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.51 and earlier does not require POST requests for the form submission endpoint reconfiguring slices, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    This vulnerability allows attackers to apply different slice configurations to attacker-specified jobs.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.52 requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoint.
  plugins:
  - name: configurationslicing
    previous: '1.51'
    fixed: '1.52'

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21618

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.0.2 and earlier does not escape parameter names and descriptions for past builds.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.0.3 escapes parameter names and descriptions when creating new parameters.
  plugins:
  - name: repository-connector
    previous: 2.0.2
    fixed: 2.0.3

  title: XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21619
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.18.1 and earlier does not escape the user display name shown in claims.

    This results in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers who are able to control the display names of Jenkins users, either via the security realm, or directly inside Jenkins.

    NOTE: Everyone with a Jenkins account can change their own display name.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.18.2 escapes the user display name shown in claims.
  plugins:
  - name: claim
    previous: 2.18.1
    fixed: 2.18.2

  title: CSRF vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21620
  cvss:
    severity: High

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.18.1 and earlier does not require POST requests for the form submission endpoint assigning claims, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    This vulnerability allows attackers to change claims.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.18.2 requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoint.
  plugins:
  - name: claim
    previous: 2.18.1
    fixed: 2.18.2

  title: Support bundles can include user session IDs in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21621
  cvss:
    severity: Low
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.72 and earlier provides the serialized user authentication as part of the "About user (basic authentication details only)" information (`user.md`).

    In some configurations, this can include the session ID of the user creating the support bundle.
    Attackers with access to support bundle content and the Jenkins instance could use this information to impersonate the user who created the support bundle.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.72.1 no longer provides the serialized user authentication as part of the "About user (basic authentication details only)" information.

    As a workaround, deselecting "About user (basic authentication details only)" before creating a support bundle will exclude the affected information from the bundle.
  plugins:
  - name: support-core
    previous: '2.72'
    fixed: 2.72.1

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.0.0 and earlier does not escape parameter names and descriptions.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.0.1 escapes parameter names and descriptions.
  plugins:
  - name: artifact-repository-parameter
    previous: 1.0.0
    fixed: 1.0.1
