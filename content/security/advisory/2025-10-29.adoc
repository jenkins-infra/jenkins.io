  title: Replay vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2025-64131
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 4.583.vc68232f7018a_ and earlier does not implement a replay cache.

    This allows attackers able to obtain information about the SAML authentication flow between a user's web browser and Jenkins to replay those requests, authenticating to Jenkins as that user.

    PLUGIN_NAME 4.583.585.v22ccc1139f55 implements a replay cache that rejects replayed requests.

  title: Missing permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2025-64132
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 0.84.v50ca_24ef83f2 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several MCP tools.

    This allows to do the following:

    * Attackers with Item/Read permission can obtain information about the configured SCM in a job despite lacking Item/Extended Read permission (`getJobScm`).
    * Attackers with Item/Read permission can trigger new builds of a job despite lacking Item/Build permission (`triggerBuild`).
    * Attackers without Overall/Read permission can retrieve the names of configured clouds (`getStatus`).

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.86.v7d3355e6a_a_18 performs permission checks for the affected MCP tools.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.3.1 and earlier includes an outdated version of JDepend Maven Plugin that does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

    This allows attackers able to configure input files for the "Report JDepend" step to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.0.1.301.v963cffe8ddb_8 and earlier sets the Java system property `jdk.http.auth.tunneling.disabledSchemes` to an empty value as part of applying a proxy configuration.

    This disables https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/8u111-relnotes.html[a protection mechanism of the Java runtime] addressing CVE-2016-5597.
