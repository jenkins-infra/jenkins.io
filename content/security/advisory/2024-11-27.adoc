  title: Denial of service vulnerability in bundled json-lib
  cve: CVE-2024-47855
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
  description: |-
    Jenkins uses the library https://github.com/jenkinsci/json-lib[`org.kohsuke.stapler:json-lib`] to process JSON.
    This library is the Jenkins project's fork of https://search.maven.org/artifact/net.sf.json-lib/json-lib[`net.sf.json-lib:json-lib`], which has since been renamed to https://search.maven.org/artifact/org.kordamp.json/json-lib-core[`org.kordamp.json:json-lib-core`].

    Jenkins LTS 2.479.1 and earlier, 2.486 and earlier bundles `org.kohsuke.stapler:json-lib` 2.4-jenkins-7 or earlier.
    These releases are affected by https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-47855[CVE-2024-47855].

    In Jenkins (without plugins) this allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to keep HTTP requests handling threads busy indefinitely, using system resources and preventing legitimate users from using Jenkins.
    Additionally, the Jenkins security team has identified multiple plugins that allow attackers lacking Overall/Read permission to do the same.
    These plugins include https://plugins.jenkins.io/sonar/[SonarQube Scanner] and https://plugins.jenkins.io/bitbucket/[Bitbucket].
    Additionally, other features of Jenkins or plugins that process user-provided JSON may be affected, resulting in those features being blocked.

    The fix for CVE-2024-47855 in `org.kordamp.json:json-lib-core` has been backported to `org.kohsuke.stapler:json-lib` and released in version 2.4-jenkins-8.
    Jenkins LTS 2.479.2, 2.487 bundles `org.kohsuke.stapler:json-lib` 2.4-jenkins-8.

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2024-54003
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.4.4 and earlier does not escape the view name.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with View/Create permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.4.5 escapes the view name.
  plugins:
  - name: simple-queue
    previous: 1.4.4
    fixed: 1.4.5

  title: Path traversal vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2024-54004
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 0.0.14 and earlier does not restrict the path used for the File system objects list Parameter.

    This allows attackers with Item/Configure permission to enumerate file names on the Jenkins controller file system.

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.0.15 ensures that paths used by the File system objects list Parameter are restricted to an allow list, with the default base directory set to `$JENKINS_HOME/userContent/`.
    The allow list can be configured to include additional custom base directories.
  plugins:
  - name: filesystem-list-parameter-plugin
    previous: 0.0.14
    fixed: 0.0.15
