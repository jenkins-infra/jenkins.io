This advisory announces multiple vulnerabilities in Jenkins.

== Description


=== Remote code execution vulnerability in remoting module
*SECURITY-232 / CVE-2016-0788*

A vulnerability in the Jenkins remoting module allowed unauthenticated remote attackers to open a JRMP listener on the server hosting the Jenkins master process, which allowed arbitrary code execution.


=== HTTP response splitting vulnerability
*SECURITY-238 / CVE-2016-0789*

An HTTP response splitting vulnerability in the CLI command documentation allowed attackers to craft Jenkins URLs that serve malicious content.


=== Non-constant time comparison of API token
*SECURITY-241 / CVE-2016-0790*

The verification of user-provided API tokens with the expected value did not use a constant-time comparison algorithm, potentially allowing attackers to use statistical methods to determine valid API tokens using brute-force methods.


=== Non-constant time comparison of CSRF crumbs
*SECURITY-245 / CVE-2016-0791*

The verification of user-provided CSRF crumbs with the expected value did not use a constant-time comparison algorithm, potentially allowing attackers to use statistical methods to determine valid CSRF crumbs using brute-force methods.


=== Remote code execution through remote API
*SECURITY-247 / CVE-2016-0792*

Jenkins has several API endpoints that allow low-privilege users to POST XML files that then get deserialized by Jenkins. Maliciously crafted XML files sent to these API endpoints could result in arbitrary code execution.



== Severity

* SECURITY-232 is considered *link:http://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H[critical]* as it allows unprivileged attackers to execute arbitrary code in many configurations.
* SECURITY-238 is considered *link:http://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N[medium]* as it allows unprivileged attackers to send maliciously crafted links that result e.g. in XSS to victims.
* SECURITY-241 is considered *link:http://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H[high]* as it allows unprivileged attackers to brute-force valid login credentials.
* SECURITY-245 is considered *link:http://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N[medium]* as it allows unprivileged attackers to brute-force CSRF protection.
* SECURITY-247 is considered *link:http://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H[high]* as it allows low-privilege attackers to execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins master.

== Affected versions

* All Jenkins main line releases up to and including 1.649
* All Jenkins LTS releases up to and including 1.642.1

== Fix

* Jenkins main line users should update to 1.650
* Jenkins LTS users should update to 1.642.2

These versions include fixes to all the vulnerabilities described above. All prior versions are affected by these vulnerabilities.
