  reporter: Matthias Nodeland
  cve: CVE-2018-1000176
  cvss:
    severity: low
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  plugins:
    - name: email-ext
      fixed: 2.62 # originally released 2018-03-23
      previous: 2.61
  description: |
    Email Extension Plugin stores an SMTP password in the global Jenkins configuration.

    While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form.
    This could result in exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

    Email Extension now encrypts the SMTP password transmitted to administrators viewing the global configuration form.

  reporter: Kalle Niemitalo, Procomp Solutions Oy
  cve: CVE-2018-1000175
  cvss:
    severity: medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N
  plugins:
    - name: htmlpublisher
      fixed: 1.16
      previous: 1.15
  description: |
    HTML Publisher Plugin allows specifying a name for the HTML reports it publishes.
    This report name was used in the URL of the report and as a directory name on the Jenkins controller without further processing, resulting in a path traversal vulnerability that allowed overriding files outside the build directory.

    Non-alphanumeric characters in report names are now escaped for use as part of a URL and as a directory name.
