  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2024-28793
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.0.4 and earlier does not escape the Rational Team Concert (RTC) server URI on the build page when showing changes.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to configure jobs.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.0.5 escapes the Rational Team Concert (RTC) server URI on the build page when showing changes.

  title: XXE vulnerabilities in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2024-4189 (LrScriptResultsParser.java), CVE-2024-4184 (XpathReader.java),
    CVE-2024-4690 (others)
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 24.1.0 and earlier does not configure its XML parsers to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

    This allows attackers able to control the input files for PLUGIN_NAME build steps and post-build steps to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

    PLUGIN_NAME 24.1.1-beta disables external entity resolution for its XML parsers.

    NOTE: The fix is currently available only as a beta release.
    Beta releases will not appear in the regular update center but can be found in the experimental update center.
    For more information on how to install a beta release, see this link:/doc/developer/publishing/releasing-experimental-updates/#using-the-experimental-update-center[documentation].

  title: Missing permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2024-4211 (ALM jobs configurations), CVE-2024-4691 (ALM Octane configurations),
    CVE-2024-4692 (Service Virtualization configurations)
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 24.1.0 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate ALM jobs configurations, ALM Octane configurations and Service Virtualization configurations.

    PLUGIN_NAME 24.1.1-beta requires Item/Configure permission to enumerate ALM jobs configurations, ALM Octane configurations and Service Virtualization configurations.

    NOTE: The fix is currently available only as a beta release.
    Beta releases will not appear in the regular update center but can be found in the experimental update center.
    For more information on how to install a beta release, see this link:/doc/developer/publishing/releasing-experimental-updates/#using-the-experimental-update-center[documentation].

  title: Path traversal vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2024-5273
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.2 and earlier does not perform path validation of the workspace directory while serving report files.

    Additionally, PLUGIN_NAME does not support distributed builds.

    This results in a path traversal vulnerability, allowing attackers with Item/Configure permission to retrieve Surefire failures, PMD violations, Findbugs bugs, and Checkstyle errors on the controller file system by editing the workspace path.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
