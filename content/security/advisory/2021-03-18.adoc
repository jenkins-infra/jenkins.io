  title: Incorrect permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME may allow accessing some items
  cve: CVE-2021-21623
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    Items (like jobs) can be organized hierarchically in Jenkins, using the Folders Plugin or something similar.
    An item is expected to be accessible only if all its ancestors are accessible as well.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.6.5 and earlier does not correctly perform permission checks to determine whether an item should be accessible.

    This allows attackers with Item/Read permission on nested items to access them, even if they lack Item/Read permission for parent folders.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.6.6 requires Item/Read permission on parent items to grant Item/Read permission on an individual item.

    As a workaround in older releases, do not grant permissions on individual items to users who do not have access to parent items.

    In case of problems, the link:/doc/book/managing/system-properties/[Java system property] `hudson.security.AuthorizationMatrixProperty.checkParentPermissions` can be set to `false`, completely disabling this fix.

    Items (like jobs) can be organized hierarchically in Jenkins, using the Folders Plugin or something similar.
    An item is expected to be accessible only if all its ancestors are accessible as well.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.1 and earlier does not correctly perform permission checks to determine whether an item should be accessible.

    This allows attackers with Item/Read permission on nested items to access them, even if they lack Item/Read permission for parent folders.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.1.1 requires Item/Read permission on parent items to grant Item/Read permission on an individual item.

    As a workaround in older releases, do not grant permissions on individual items to users who do not have access to parent items.

    In case of problems, the link:/doc/book/managing/system-properties/[Java system property] `com.michelin.cio.hudson.plugins.rolestrategy.RoleMap.checkParentPermissions` can be set to `false`, completely disabling this fix.

  title: Missing permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME allows enumerating credentials IDs
  cve: CVE-2021-21625
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.28 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a helper method for HTTP endpoints.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials IDs of AWS credentials stored in Jenkins if any of the following plugins are installed:

    * plugin:amazon-ecs[Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) / Fargate]
    * plugin:aws-parameter-store[AWS Parameter Store Build Wrapper]
    * plugin:aws-sam[AWS SAM]

    Further plugins may use this helper method as well without performing a permission check themselves.

    Credentials IDs obtained this way can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.28.1 performs permission checks in the helper method for HTTP endpoints.

  - name: aws-credentials

  title: Missing permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME allow listing workspace contents
  cve: CVE-2021-21626
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 8.4.4 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods implementing form validation.

    This allows attackers with Item/Read permission but without Item/Workspace or Item/Configure permission to check whether attacker-specified file patterns match workspace contents.
    A sequence of requests can be used to effectively list workspace contents.

    PLUGIN_NAME 8.5.0 requires Item/Configure permission to validate patterns with workspace contents.

  - name: warnings-ng

  title: CSRF vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME

    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.9.0 and earlier does not require POST requests for a form submission endpoint, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    This vulnerability allows attackers to stop hypervisor domains.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.9.1 requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoint.
  plugins:
  - name: libvirt-slave
    previous: 1.9.0
    fixed: 1.9.1
