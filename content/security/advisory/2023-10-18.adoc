  title: HTTP/2 denial of service vulnerabilities in bundled Jetty
  cve: CVE-2023-36478, CVE-2023-44487
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
  description: |-
    Jenkins bundles Winstone-Jetty, a wrapper around Jetty, to act as HTTP and servlet server when started using `java -jar jenkins.war`.
    This is how Jenkins is run when using any of the installers or packages, but not when run using servlet containers such as Tomcat.

    Jenkins 2.427 and earlier, LTS 2.414.2 and earlier bundles versions of Jetty affected by the security vulnerabilities https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-36478[CVE-2023-36478] and https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-44487[CVE-2023-44487].
    These vulnerabilities allow unauthenticated attackers to cause a denial of service.

    NOTE: This only affects instances that enable HTTP/2, typically using the `--http2Port` argument to `java -jar jenkins.war` or corresponding options in service configuration files.
    It is disabled by default in all native installers and the Docker images provided by the Jenkins project.

    Jenkins 2.428, LTS 2.414.3 updates the bundled Jetty to version 10.0.17, which is unaffected by these issues.

    Administrators unable to update to these releases of Jenkins (or newer) are advised to disable HTTP/2.
