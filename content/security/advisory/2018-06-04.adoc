  title: Server-side request forgery vulnerability in Git Plugin
  reporter: Thomas de Grenier de Latour
  cve: CVE-2018-1000182
  cvss:
    severity: medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
  plugins:
    - name: git
      fixed: 3.9.1
      previous: 3.9.0
  description: |
    Various form validation methods in Git Plugin did not check the permission of the user accessing them, allowing anyone with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to cause Jenkins to send a GET request to a specified URL.

    Additionally, these form validation methods did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

    These form validation methods now require POST requests and the Overall/Administer permission.

  title: Server-side request forgery vulnerability in GitHub Plugin
  reporter: Thomas de Grenier de Latour
  cve: CVE-2018-1000184
  cvss:
    severity: medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
  plugins:
    - name: github
      fixed: 1.29.1
      previous: 1.29.0
  description: |
    A form validation method in GitHub Plugin did not check the permission of the user accessing it, allowing anyone with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to cause Jenkins to send a POST request to a specified URL.

    If that request's HTTP response code indicates success, the form validation is returning a generic success message, otherwise the HTTP status code is returned.

    Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

    The form validation method now requires POST requests and the Overall/Administer permission.

  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in GitHub Plugin allowed capturing credentials
  reporter: Thomas de Grenier de Latour
  cve: CVE-2018-1000183
  cvss:
    severity: medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
  plugins:
    - name: github
      fixed: 1.29.1
      previous: 1.29.0
  description: |
    GitHub Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
    This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

    Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

    This form validation method now requires POST requests and appropriate user permissions.

  title: Kubernetes Plugin printed sensitive build variables to logs
  reporter: Jesse Glick, CloudBees, Inc.
  cve: CVE-2018-1000187
  cvss:
    severity: low
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

      previous: 1.7.0
  description: |
    Kubernetes Plugin printed sensitive build variables, like passwords, to the build log and controller log, when using pipeline steps like `withDockerRegistry`.

    The plugin now applies masking of sensitive build variables to these pipeline steps.

  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in AbsInt Astrée Plugin allowed launching programs on the Jenkins controller
  reporter: Thomas de Grenier de Latour
  cve: CVE-2018-1000189
  cvss:
    severity: high
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

  description: |
    AbsInt Astrée Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
    This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to run a user-specified program on the Jenkins controller.

    Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

    This form validation method no longer implements the validation that required a program to be invoked.
