  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME

  cvss:
    severity: High

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.5.34 and earlier does not escape multiple user-provided values shown as part of the build cause of webhook-triggered builds.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.5.35 does not show user-provided fields in the build cause of webhook-triggered builds.

    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME has options in its post-build step configuration to not escape test descriptions and exception messages.

    If those options are unchecked, PLUGIN_NAME 554.va4a552116332 and earlier renders the unescaped text provided in test results.

    This results in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to configure jobs or control test results.

    PLUGIN_NAME 555.va0d5f66521e3 by default ignores the user-level options to not escape content.

    Administrators who want to restore this functionality must set the link:/doc/book/managing/system-properties/[Java system property] `hudson.plugins.testng.Publisher.allowUnescapedHTML` to `true`.

  title: Missing permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME allow enumerating credentials IDs

  cvss:

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 22.0.0 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.
    Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

    An enumeration of credentials IDs in PLUGIN_NAME 22.0.1 requires Overall/Administer permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME 22.0.0 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods implementing form validation.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified HTTP server using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

    Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 22.0.1 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation methods.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.2 and earlier does not perform a permission check in multiple HTTP endpoints.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to send an HTTP request to an attacker-specified URL and parse the response as XML.

    As the plugin does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks, attackers can have Jenkins parse a crafted XML response that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

    Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    Additionally, the plugin allows users to export the full configuration of jobs as part of a recipe, granting access to job configuration XML data to every user with Item/Read permission.
    The encrypted values of secrets stored in the job configuration are not redacted, as they would be by the config.xml API for users without Item/Configure permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.1.1 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to create and delete XPath expressions.

    Additionally, these HTTP endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix. link:/security/plugins/#unresolved[Learn why we announce this.]

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.2.1 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several views and HTTP endpoints.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to disable jobs.

    Additionally, these endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    NOTE: This CSRF vulnerability is only exploitable in Jenkins 2.286 and earlier, LTS 2.277.1 and earlier.
    See the link:/doc/upgrade-guide/2.277/#upgrading-to-jenkins-lts-2-277-2[LTS upgrade guide].
