This advisory announces two vulnerabilities in Jenkins.

== Description

=== Random failures to initialize the setup wizard on startup
*SECURITY-667 / CVE-2017-1000503*

A race condition during Jenkins startup could result in the wrong order of execution of commands during initialization.

On Jenkins 2.81 and newer, including LTS 2.89.1, this could in rare cases (we estimate less than 20% of new instances) result in failure to initialize the setup wizard on the first startup.
This resulted in the following security settings not being set to their usual strict default:

* No security realm was defined, and no `admin` user was created whose password was written to the Jenkins log or the `initialAdminPassword` file.
* The authorization strategy remained _Anyone can do anything_ rather than _Logged-in users can do anything_.
* _TCP port for JNLP agents_, usually disabled by default, was open, unless a Java system property controlling it was set.
* _CLI over Remoting_ was enabled.
* _CSRF Protection_ was disabled.
* _Agent â†’ Master Access Control_ was disabled.

Affected instances need to be configured to restrict access.


=== CSRF protection delayed after startup
*SECURITY-667 / CVE-2017-1000504*

A race condition during Jenkins startup could result in the wrong order of execution of commands during initialization.

There's a very short window of time after startup during which Jenkins may no longer show the "Please wait while Jenkins is getting ready to work" message, but Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection may not yet be effective.
As of publication of this advisory, we've been unable to confirm this can actually be exploited, but generally recommend that users upgrade to the fixed versions below.


== Severity

* SECURITY-667: link:https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H[high]


== Affected versions

* Random failures to initialize the setup wizard on startup:
** Jenkins 2.81 through 2.94 (inclusive)
** Jenkins LTS 2.89.1
* CSRF protection delayed after startup:
** Jenkins up to and including 2.94
** Jenkins LTS up to and including 2.89.1


== Fix

* Jenkins main line users should update to 2.95
* Jenkins LTS users should update to 2.89.2
* Users who originally installed Jenkins 2.81 through 2.94, or LTS 2.89.1, should review all the options of the _Configure Global Security_ screen.

These versions include fixes to all the vulnerabilities described above.
All prior versions are affected by these vulnerabilities unless otherwise indicated.
