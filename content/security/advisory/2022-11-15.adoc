  title: Whole-script approval in PLUGIN_NAME vulnerable to SHA-1 collisions
  cve: CVE-2022-45379
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1189.vb_a_b_7c8fd5fde and earlier stores whole-script approvals as the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1[SHA-1 hash] of the approved script.
    SHA-1 no longer meets the security standards for producing a cryptographically secure message digest.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1190.v65867a_a_47126 uses SHA-512 for new whole-script approvals.
    Previously approved scripts will have their SHA-1 based whole-script approval replaced with a corresponding SHA-512 whole-script approval when the script is next used.

    NOTE: Whole-script approval only stores the SHA-1 or SHA-512 hash, so it is not possible to migrate all previously approved scripts automatically on startup.

    Administrators concerned about SHA-1 collision attacks on the whole-script approval feature are able to revoke all previous (SHA-1) script approvals on the In-Process Script Approval page.

    PLUGIN_NAME implements a `readProperties` Pipeline step that supports interpolation of variables using the Apache Commons Configuration library.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.13.0 and earlier does not restrict the set of enabled prefix interpolators and bundles versions of this library with the vulnerability https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-configuration/security.html#CVE-2022-33980_prior_to_2.8.0.2C_RCE_when_applied_to_untrusted_input[CVE-2022-33980].

    This vulnerability allows attackers able to configure Pipelines to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.13.1 bundles version 2.8.0 of the Apache Commons Configuration library, which disables the problematic prefix interpolators by default.

    PLUGIN_NAME implements a `readProperties` Pipeline step that supports interpolation of variables using the Apache Commons Configuration library.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.13.1 and earlier does not restrict the set of enabled prefix interpolators and bundles versions of this library that enable the `file:` prefix interpolator by default.

    This allows attackers able to configure Pipelines to read arbitrary files from the Jenkins controller file system.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.13.2 restricts the set of prefix interpolators enabled by default to `base64Decoder:`, `base64Encoder:`, `date:`, `urlDecoder:`, and `urlEncoder:`.

    Administrators can set the link:/doc/book/managing/system-properties/[Java system property] `org.jenkinsci.plugins.pipeline.utility.steps.conf.ReadPropertiesStepExecution.CUSTOM_PREFIX_INTERPOLATOR_LOOKUPS` to customize which prefix interpolators are enabled.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1206.v14049fa_b_d860 and earlier does not correctly perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

    This allows attackers with Support/DownloadBundle permission to download a previously created support bundle containing information limited to users with Overall/Administer permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1206.1208.v9b_7a_1d48db_0f deprecates the Support/DownloadBundle permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME provides several webhook endpoints that can be used to trigger builds when Docker images used by a job have been rebuilt.

    In PLUGIN_NAME 2.6.2 and earlier, these endpoints can be accessed without authentication.

    This allows unauthenticated attackers to trigger builds of jobs corresponding to the attacker-specified repository.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.6.2.1 requires a token as a part of webhook URLs, which will act as authentication for the webhook endpoint.
    As a result, all webhook URLs in the plugin will be different after updating the plugin.

    Administrators can set the link:/doc/book/managing/system-properties/[Java system] property `org.jenkinsci.plugins.registry.notification.webhook.JSONWebHook.DO_NOT_REQUIRE_API_TOKEN` to `true` to disable this fix.

    NOTE: Because Jenkins agent processes usually execute build tools whose input (source code, build scripts, etc.) is controlled externally, this vulnerability only has a real impact in very narrow circumstances: when attackers can control XML files, but are unable to change build steps, Jenkinsfiles, test code that gets executed on the agents, or similar.
