  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2238
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 0.9.12 and earlier does not escape the repository field on the 'Build with Parameters' page.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.9.13 escapes the repository field on the 'Build with Parameters' page.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 3.1.3 and earlier stores a secret unencrypted in its global configuration file `org.jenkinsci.plugins.ParameterizedRemoteTrigger.RemoteBuildConfiguration.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.
    This secret can be viewed by attackers with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.1.4 stores the secret encrypted once its configuration is saved again.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.6 and earlier does not require POST requests for the database console, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL scripts.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.7 removes the database console.

  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2241 (CSRF), CVE-2020-2242 (permission check)
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.6 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified database server using attacker-specified username and password.

    Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.7 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation method.

  - name: database
    previous: '1.6'
    fixed: '1.7'

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 3.0.4 and earlier does not escape build descriptions in tooltips.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Run/Update permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.0.5 removes affected tooltips.
  plugins:
  - name: vmanager-plugin
    previous: 3.0.4

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.27.0 and earlier does not escape matching text in a form validation response.

    This results in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to provide console output for builds used to test build log indications.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.27.1 escapes matching text in the affected form validation response.
  plugins:
  - name: build-failure-analyzer

  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 0.28 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

    This allows a user able to control the input files for the Valgrind plugin parser to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.
    Â 

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 0.28 and earlier does not escape content in Valgrind XML reports.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control Valgrind XML report contents.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2020.2.1 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

    This allows a user able to control the input files for the Klocwork plugin parser to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
  plugins:

    PLUGIN_NAME 5.157.1 and earlier stores a webhook secret unencrypted in its global configuration file `hudson.plugins.tfs.TeamPluginGlobalConfig.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.
    This secret can be viewed by attackers with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

  title: Passwords stored in plain text by PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2250
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.3 and earlier stores project passwords unencrypted in job `config.xml` files as part of its configuration.
    These project passwords can be viewed by attackers with Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.4 stores project passwords encrypted once affected job configurations are saved again.
  plugins:
  - name: soapui-pro-functional-testing
    previous: '1.3'
    fixed: '1.4'
- id: SECURITY-1631 (2)

  title: Passwords transmitted in plain text by PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2251
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME stores project passwords in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

    While these passwords are stored encrypted on disk since PLUGIN_NAME 1.4, they are transmitted in plain text as part of the global configuration form by PLUGIN_NAME 1.5 and earlier.
    These passwords can be viewed by attackers with Extended Read permission.

    This only affects Jenkins before 2.236, including 2.235.x LTS, as Jenkins 2.236 introduces a security hardening that transparently encrypts and decrypts data used for a Jenkins password form field.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

  - name: soapui-pro-functional-testing
