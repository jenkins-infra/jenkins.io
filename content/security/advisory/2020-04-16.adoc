  title: Credentials stored in plain text by PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2177
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 0.3 and earlier stores credentials unencrypted in job `config.xml` files as part of its configuration.
    These credentials can be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the master file system.

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.6.1 stores these credentials encrypted.
    This change is effective once the job configuration is saved the next time.
  plugins:
  - name: copr
    previous: '0.3'
    fixed: 0.6.1

  title: XXE vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2178
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N

    PLUGIN_NAME implements a static analysis parser for various Parasoft products and integrates with plugin:warnings[Warnings Plugin] (10.4.1 and earlier) and plugin:warnings-ng[Warnings NG Plugin] (10.4.2 and newer).

    PLUGIN_NAME 10.4.3 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.
    This allows a user able to control the input files for the Parasoft Findings parser to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins master or server-side request forgery.

    PLUGIN_NAME 10.4.4 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.

  - name: parasoft-findings
    previous: 10.4.3
    fixed: 10.4.4

  title: RCE vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2179
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 0.2.0 and earlier does not configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types.
    This results in a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure a multi-configuration (Matrix) job, or control the contents of a previously configured job's SCM repository.

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.2.1 configures its YAML parser to only instantiate safe types.
  plugins:
  - name: yaml-axis
    previous: 0.2.0
    fixed: 0.2.1
- id: SECURITY-1736
  title: RCE vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2180
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.2.2 and earlier does not configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types.
    This results in a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure a job or control the contents of a previously configured "AWS SAM deploy application" build step's YAML SAM template file (`template.yaml` or equivalent) file.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.2.3 configures its YAML parser to only instantiate safe types.
  plugins:
  - name: aws-sam
    previous: 1.2.2
    fixed: 1.2.3
