  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in expandable textbox form control
  cve: CVE-2019-10401
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    Jenkins form controls include an expandable textbox that can transform from a single-line text box to a multi-line text area.

    The implementation of this transformation interpreted the text content of the form field as HTML.
    This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the contents of such `f:expandableTextbox` form controls.

    Jenkins no longer interprets `f:expandableTextbox` text content as HTML when transforming it.

  reporter: Matt Sicker, CloudBees Inc. and Wadeck Follonier, CloudBees Inc.
  title: XSS vulnerability in combobox form control
  cve: CVE-2019-10402
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    Jenkins interpreted items added to `f:combobox` form controls as HTML.
    This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the contents of `f:combobox` form controls.

    Jenkins no longer interprets items added to a combobox as HTML.

    [NOTE]
    ======
    This might be a breaking change for plugins that relied on the previous, undocumented behavior to add formatting to `f:combobox` elements.
    This has been removed without replacement.
    Plugin developers are advised to only add plain text entries to `f:combobox` controls.

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in SCM tag action tooltip
  cve: CVE-2019-10403
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    Jenkins did not escape the tag name on the tooltip for tag actions shown in the build history.
    This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the SCM tag name for these actions.

    Jenkins now escapes the SCM tag action.

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in queue item tooltip
  cve: CVE-2019-10404
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    Jenkins did not escape the reason a queue item is blocked in tooltips.
    This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the reason a queue item is blocked, for example a label expression that does not match idle executors.

    Jenkins now escapes the reason a queue item is blocked in tooltips.

  title: Diagnostic web page exposed Cookie HTTP header
  cve: CVE-2019-10405
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    Jenkins shows various technical information about the current user on the `/whoAmI` URL.
    The information shown includes HTTP request headers.

    This allowed attackers able to exploit another cross-site scripting vulnerability to obtain the `Cookie` header's value even if the `HttpOnly` flag would prevent direct access via JavaScript.

    Jenkins no longer shows the value of the `Cookie` HTTP header on the `/whoAmI` URL.

  reporter: Katherine Hough &lt;khough2@gmu.edu&gt; and Jonathan Bell &lt;bellj@gmu.edu&gt;
  title: XSS vulnerability in Jenkins URL setting
  cve: CVE-2019-10406
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    Jenkins did not validate or otherwise limit the possible values administrators could specify as Jenkins root URL.

    This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by users with Overall/Administer permission.

    Jenkins now prevents values other than HTTP/HTTPS URLs from being set as Jenkins root URL.
    Existing instances with invalid root URLs will behave as if no root URL was set.

    [NOTE]
    ======
    In case this results in problems, e.g. a valid URL unexpectedly being rejected, set the system property `jenkins.model.JenkinsLocationConfiguration.disableUrlValidation` to `true` to disable this restriction.

    PLUGIN_NAME showed secret environment variables defined in Mask Passwords Plugin
  cve: CVE-2019-10407
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    Mask Passwords Plugin allows users to define secret environment variables (typically passwords) to be passed to builds, both globally, and for specific jobs.
    These environment variables are expected to not be shown.

    PLUGIN_NAME showed the variable values on its _Full Build Flow_ view and included them in the metadata download without masking.

    PLUGIN_NAME no longer shows variables contributed from Mask Password Plugin without masking.

    CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2019-10408 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10409 (permission check)
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME allows the creation of projects based on templates defined in the plugin configuration.

    A missing permission check in the HTTP endpoint triggering project creation allowed users with Overall/Read permission to create these projects.
    Additionally, the HTTP endpoint did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

    The HTTP endpoint triggering project creation now requires Item/Create permission and submission of requests via POST.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME did not escape an error message shown when log parsing patterns are invalid.
    This resulted in a persisted cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the log parsing rules configuration, typically users with Job/Configure permission.

    Jenkins applies the missing escaping by default since 2.146 and LTS 2.138.2, so newer Jenkins releases are not affected by this vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME now escapes all variables displayed in its views.
