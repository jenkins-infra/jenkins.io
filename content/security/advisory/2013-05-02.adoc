This advisory announces multiple security vulnerabilities that were found in Jenkins core.


== Description
=== SECURITY-63 / CVE-2013-2034
This creates a link:https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF)[cross-site request forgery (CSRF)] vulnerability on Jenkins master, where an anonymous attacker can trick an administrator to execute arbitrary code on Jenkins master by having him open a specifically crafted attack URL.

There's also a related vulnerability where the permission check on this ability is done imprecisely, which may affect those who are running Jenkins instances with a jenkinsdoc:AuthorizationStrategy[custom authorization strategy] plugin.

=== SECURITY-67 / CVE-2013-2033
This creates a link:https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)[cross-site scripting (XSS)] vulnerability, where an attacker with a valid user account on Jenkins can execute JavaScript in the browser of other users, if those users are using certain browsers.

=== SECURITY-69 / CVE-2013-2034
This is another CSRF vulnerability that allows an attacker to cause a deployment of binaries to Maven repositories. This vulnerability has the same CVE ID as SEUCRITY-63.

=== SECURITY-71 / CVE-2013-1808
This creates a link:https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)[cross-site scripting (XSS)] vulnerability.


== Severity
SECURITY-63 is rated *critical*, since it enables arbitrary code execution.

SECURITY-71 and SECURITY-69 are rated as *high*, as it allows malicious users to gain unauthorized access to the information and impersonate the administrator of the system. In addition, this allows Jenkins inside a firewall to be attacked from outside. On the other hands, this attack can be only mounted passively, and the attacker needs to know the URL of your Jenkins installations.

SECURITY-67 is rated *medium*, as it requires an attacker to be a valid user of Jenkins with a write access.

== Fix
* Main line users should upgrade to Jenkins 1.514
* LTS users should upgrade to 1.509.1

All the prior versions are affected by these vulnerabilities.
