  title: EdDSA implementation in PLUGIN_NAME exhibits signature malleability
  cve: CVE-2020-36843
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME makes the EdDSA-Java library (`ed25519-java`) available to other plugins.

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.3.0-13.v7cb_69ed68f00 and earlier bundles version 0.3.0 of EdDSA-Java, which exhibits signature malleability and does not satisfy the SUF-CMA (Strong Existential Unforgeability under Chosen Message Attacks) property.
    This allows attackers to create new valid signatures different from previous signatures for a known message.

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.3.0.1-16.vcb_4a_98a_3531c inlines the EdDSA-Java library (`ed25519-java`) directly into the plugin and adds validation to prevent signature malleability and ensure the SUF-CMA property.

  - name: eddsa-api

    fixed: 0.3.0.1-16.vcb_4a_98a_3531c

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2025-30196
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.0 does not limit URL schemes for links it creates based on workspace content, allowing the `javascript:` scheme.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the input file for the Anchor Chain post-build step.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

  title: API key displayed without masking by PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2025-30197
  cvss:
    severity: Low
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME stores the QEngine API Key in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

    While this key is stored encrypted on disk, in PLUGIN_NAME 1.0.29.vfa_cc23396502 and earlier the job configuration form does not mask the QEngine API Key form field, increasing the potential for attackers to observe and capture it.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.0.31.v4a_b_1db_6d6a_f2 masks the QEngine API Key form field.
  plugins:
  - name: zohoqengine
    previous: 1.0.29.vfa_cc23396502
    fixed: 1.0.31.v4a_b_1db_6d6a_f2
