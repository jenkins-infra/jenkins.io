  title: XML External Entity processing vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2019-10337
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:L
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME did not configure its XML parser in a way that would prevent XML External Entity (XXE) processing.

    This allowed attackers able to control the contents of files processed with the `${XML}` macro to have Jenkins parse a maliciously crafted XML file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins agent, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

    PLUGIN_NAME no longer processes XML External Entities in XML documents.

  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2019-10338 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10339 (improper authorization)
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
    This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified Kubernetes server and obtain information about an attacker-specified namespace.
    Doing so might also leak service account credentials used for the connection.
    Additionally, it allowed attackers to obtain the value of any attacker-specified environment variable for the Jenkins controller process.

    Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

    This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions.

  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME allowed SSRF
  cve: CVE-2019-10331 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10332 (missing permission checks)
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    A missing permission check in a form validation method in PLUGIN_NAME allowed users with Overall/Read permission to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server with attacker-specified username and password.

    Additionally, the form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

    This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions.

  title: Missing permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2019-10333
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    Various form validation and form autocompletion methods in PLUGIN_NAME lacked permission checks.
    This allowed attackers with Overall/Read access to obtain information about the configuration of PLUGIN_NAME, as well as the configuration and data of connected ElectricFlow servers.

    These form validation and autocompletion methods now require Overall/Administer or Job/Configure permission, as appropriate for the given method.

  title: PLUGIN_NAME globally and unconditionally disabled SSL/TLS certificate validation
  cve: CVE-2019-10334
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME unconditionally disabled SSL/TLS certificate validation for the entire Jenkins controller JVM during the deployment/publication of an application.

    PLUGIN_NAME no longer does that.
    Instead, the existing opt-in option to ignore SSL/TLS errors is used during deployment for the specific connection.

    This issue was caused by an incomplete fix for link:../2019-02-19/#SECURITY-937[SECURITY-937].

  title: XSS vulnerability in build metadata contributed by PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2019-10335
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    The plugin adds metadata displayed on build pages during its operations.

    Any user content was not escaped, resulting in a cross-site scripting vulnerability allowing users with Job/Configure permission, or attackers controlling API responses received from ElectricFlow to render arbitrary HTML and JavaScript on Jenkins build pages.

    Build metadata is now filtered through a HTML formatter that only allows showing basic HTML, neutralizing any unsafe data.
    Additionally, all builds executed after the security update is applied will now properly escape content received from ElectricFlow.

  - name: electricflow

  title: XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME affecting job configuration forms
  cve: CVE-2019-10336
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    The configuration forms of various post-build steps contributed by PLUGIN_NAME were vulnerable to cross-site scripting.

    This allowed attackers able to control the output of connected ElectricFlow servers' APIs to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript into the configuration form.

    PLUGIN_NAME no longer interprets HTML/JavaScript in responses from ElectricFlow server APIs on job configuration forms.

  - name: electricflow

    fixed: 1.1.7
