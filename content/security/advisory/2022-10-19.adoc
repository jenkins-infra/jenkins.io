  title: 'Sandbox bypass vulnerabilities in Script Security Plugin and in Pipeline:
    Groovy Plugin'
  cve: 'CVE-2022-43401 through CVE-2022-43404'
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    Script Security Plugin provides a sandbox feature that allows low privileged users to define scripts, including Pipelines, that are generally safe to execute.
    Calls to code defined inside a sandboxed script are intercepted, and various allowlists are checked to determine whether the call is to be allowed.

    Multiple sandbox bypass vulnerabilities exist in Script Security Plugin and Pipeline: Groovy Plugin:

    * In Script Security Plugin 1183.v774b_0b_0a_a_451 and earlier and in Pipeline: Groovy Plugin 2802.v5ea_628154b_c2 and earlier, various casts performed implicitly by the Groovy language runtime were not intercepted by the sandbox.
      This includes casts performed when returning values from methods, when assigning local variables, fields, properties, and when defining default arguments for closure, constructor, and method parameters (CVE-2022-43401 in Script Security Plugin and CVE-2022-43402 in Pipeline: Groovy Plugin).
    * In Script Security Plugin 1183.v774b_0b_0a_a_451 and earlier, when casting an array-like value to an array type, per-element casts to the component type of the array are not intercepted by the sandbox (CVE-2022-43403).
    * In Script Security Plugin 1183.v774b_0b_0a_a_451 and earlier, crafted constructor bodies and calls to sandbox-generated synthetic constructors can be used to construct any subclassable type (due to an incomplete fix for SECURITY-1754 in the link:/security/advisory/2020-03-09/#SECURITY-1754[2020-03-09 security advisory]) (CVE-2022-43404).

    These vulnerabilities allow attackers with permission to define and run sandboxed scripts, including Pipelines, to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.

    These vulnerabilities have been fixed:

    * Script Security Plugin 1184.v85d16b_d851b_3 and Pipeline: Groovy Plugin 2803.v1a_f77ffcc773 intercept Groovy casts performed implicitly by the Groovy language runtime (CVE-2022-43401 in Script Security Plugin and CVE-2022-43402 in Pipeline: Groovy Plugin).
    * Script Security Plugin 1184.v85d16b_d851b_3 intercepts per-element casts when casting array-like values to array types (CVE-2022-43403).
    * Script Security Plugin 1184.v85d16b_d851b_3 rejects improper calls to sandbox-generated synthetic constructors (CVE-2022-43404).

    IMPORTANT: Both plugins, Script Security Plugin and Pipeline: Groovy Plugin must be updated simultaneously.
    While Script Security Plugin could be updated independently, doing so would cause errors in Pipeline: Groovy Plugin due to an incompatible API change.

  title: 'Sandbox bypass vulnerability in Pipeline: Groovy Libraries Plugin and Pipeline:
    Deprecated Groovy Libraries Plugin'

  description: |-
    Pipeline: Groovy Libraries Plugin and older releases of the Pipeline: Deprecated Groovy Libraries Plugin (formerly Pipeline: Shared Groovy Libraries Plugin) define the `library` Pipeline step, which allows Pipeline authors to dynamically load Pipeline libraries.
    The return value of this step can be used to instantiate classes defined in the loaded library.

    In Pipeline: Groovy Libraries Plugin 612.v84da_9c54906d and earlier and in Pipeline: Deprecated Groovy Libraries Plugin 583.vf3b_454e43966 and earlier, the `library` step can be used to invoke sandbox-generated synthetic constructors in crafted untrusted libraries and construct any subclassable type.
    This is similar to SECURITY-582 in the link:/security/advisory/2017-08-07/#multiple-groovy-language-features-allowed-script-security-plugin-sandbox-bypass[2017-08-07 security advisory], but in a different plugin.

    This vulnerability allows attackers with permission to define untrusted Pipeline libraries and to define and run sandboxed Pipelines, to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.

    Pipeline: Groovy Libraries Plugin 613.v9c41a_160233f rejects improper calls to sandbox-generated synthetic constructors when using the `library` step.

    Pipeline: Deprecated Groovy Libraries Plugin 588.v576c103a_ff86 no longer contains the `library` step.
    It has been moved into the Pipeline: Groovy Libraries Plugin.

  title: CSRF protection for any URL can be bypassed in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2022-43407
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 451.vf1a_a_4f405289 and earlier does not restrict or sanitize the optionally specified ID of the `input` step.
    This ID is used for the URLs that process user interactions for the given `input` step (proceed or abort) and is not correctly encoded.

    This allows attackers able to configure Pipelines to have Jenkins build URLs from `input` step IDs that would bypass the CSRF protection of any target URL in Jenkins when the `input` step is interacted with.

    PLUGIN_NAME 456.vd8a_957db_5b_e9 limits the characters that can be used for the ID of `input` steps in Pipelines to alphanumeric characters and URL-safe punctuation.
    Pipelines with `input` steps having IDs with prohibited characters will fail with an error.

    NOTE: This includes Pipelines that have already been started but not finished before Jenkins is restarted to apply this update.

    IMPORTANT: https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-model-definition/[Pipeline: Declarative Plugin] provides an `input` directive that is internally using the `input` step, and specifies a non-default ID if not user-defined.
    Pipeline: Declarative Plugin 2.2114.v2654ca_721309 and earlier may specify values incompatible with this new restriction on legal values:
    `input` directives in a `stage` use the stage name (which may include prohibited characters) and `input` directives in a `matrix` will use a value generated from the matrix axis values (which always includes prohibited characters).
    Administrators are advised to update PLUGIN_NAME and Pipeline: Declarative Plugin at the same time, ideally while no Pipelines are running.

    PLUGIN_NAME provides a visualization of Pipeline builds.
    It also allows users to interact with `input` steps from Pipeline: Input Step Plugin.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.26 and earlier does not correctly encode the ID of `input` steps when using it to generate URLs to proceed or abort Pipeline builds.

    This allows attackers able to configure Pipelines to specify `input` step IDs resulting in URLs that would bypass the CSRF protection of any target URL in Jenkins.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.27 correctly encodes the ID of `input` steps when using it to generate URLs to proceed or abort Pipeline builds.

    NOTE: This vulnerability is only exploitable with Pipeline: Input Step Plugin 451.vf1a_a_4f405289 or older due to the fix for link:#SECURITY-2880[SECURITY-2880].

    PLUGIN_NAME provides a feature to add hyperlinks, that send POST requests when clicked, to build logs.
    These links are used by Pipeline: Input Step Plugin to allow users to proceed or abort the build, or by Pipeline: Job Plugin to allow users to forcibly terminate the build after aborting it.

    PLUGIN_NAME 838.va_3a_087b_4055b and earlier does not sanitize or properly encode URLs of these hyperlinks in build logs.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to create Pipelines.

    PLUGIN_NAME provides a webhook endpoint at `/mercurial/notifyCommit` that can be used to notify Jenkins of changes to an SCM repository.
    This endpoint receives a repository URL, and Jenkins will schedule polling for all jobs configured with the specified repository.
    It can be accessed with GET requests and without authentication.

    In PLUGIN_NAME 1251.va_b_121f184902 and earlier, the output of the webhook endpoint will provide information about which jobs were triggered or scheduled for polling, including jobs the user has no permission to access.
    This allows attackers with knowledge of Mercurial repository URLs to obtain information about the existence of jobs configured with this Mercurial repository.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1260.vdfb_723cdcc81 does not provide the names of jobs for which polling is triggered unless the user has the appropriate Item/Read permission.

  cve: CVE-2022-43426
  cvss:
    severity: Low
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME stores AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY in its global configuration file `s3explorer.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

    While this secret is stored encrypted on disk, in PLUGIN_NAME 1.0.8 and earlier the global configuration form does not mask the AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY form field, increasing the potential for attackers to observe and capture it.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.4.8 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.
    Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

  title: Agent-to-controller security bypass vulnerabilities in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2022-43428 (Java system properties), CVE-2022-43429 (read files)
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.4.8 and earlier implements two agent/controller messages that do not limit where they can be executed.

    * `RemoteSystemProperties` allows attackers able to control agent processes to obtain the values of Java system properties from the Jenkins controller process (CVE-2022-43428).
    * `GetRemoteUTF8FileContents` allows attackers able to control agent processes to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system (CVE-2022-43429).

    NOTE: These vulnerabilities are only exploitable in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier.
    See the link:/doc/upgrade-guide/2.303/#upgrading-to-jenkins-lts-2-303-3[LTS upgrade guide].

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.4.8 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

    This allows attackers able to control the input files for the 'Topaz for Total Test - Execute Total Test scenarios' build step to have Jenkins parse a crafted XML document that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

  description: |-
    Jenkins sets the `Content-Security-Policy` header to static files served by Jenkins (specifically `DirectoryBrowserSupport`), such as workspaces, `/userContent`, or archived artifacts, unless a Resource Root URL is specified.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.0.22 and earlier globally disables the `Content-Security-Policy` header for static files served by Jenkins as soon as it is loaded.
    This allows cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by users with the ability to control files in workspaces, archived artifacts, etc.

    NOTE: Jenkins instances with link:/doc/book/security/user-content/#resource-root-url[Resource Root URL] configured are unaffected.

  description: |-
    Jenkins sets the `Content-Security-Policy` header to static files served by Jenkins (specifically `DirectoryBrowserSupport`), such as workspaces, `/userContent`, or archived artifacts, unless a Resource Root URL is specified.

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.7 and earlier programmatically updates link:/doc/book/managing/system-properties/#hudson-model-directorybrowsersupport-csp[the Java system property] allowing administrators to customize the `Content-Security-Policy` header for static files served by Jenkins to include `media-src: 'self'`.
    On a Jenkins instance with default configuration, this effectively disables all other directives in the default rule set, including `script-src`.
    This allows cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by users with the ability to control files in workspaces, archived artifacts, etc.

    NOTE: Jenkins instances with link:/doc/book/security/user-content/#resource-root-url[Resource Root URL] configured are unaffected.
