  title: Sandbox bypass in Script Security Plugin
  reporter: >

  cve: CVE-2019-1003029
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

  description: |
    Script Security sandbox protection could be circumvented during parsing, compilation, and script instantiation by providing a crafted Groovy script.

    Script Security Plugin is now newly applying sandbox protection during these phases.

    This affected both script execution (typically invoked from other plugins) as well as an HTTP endpoint providing script validation and allowed users with Overall/Read permission to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins master.

    The API `GroovySandbox#run(Script, Whitelist)` has been deprecated and now emits a warning to the system log about potential security problems.
    `GroovySandbox#run(GroovyShell, String, Whitelist)` replaces it.
    `GroovySandbox#checkScriptForCompilationErrors(String, GroovyClassLoader)` has been added as a safer method to implement script validation.

  description: |
    A missing permission check in a form validation method in Azure VM Agents Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read access to verify a submitted configuration, obtaining limited information about the Azure account and configuration.

    Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a potential CSRF vulnerability.

    This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions.

  description: |
    A missing permission check in an HTTP endpoint allowed users with Overall/Read access to attach a public IP address to an Azure VM in Azure VM Agents Plugin, making a virtual machine publicly accessible.

    Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability with more limited impact, as the IP address would not be known.

    This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions.

  title: Unprivileged users with Overall/Read access are able to enumerate credential IDs in Azure VM Agents Plugin
  reporter: Daniel Beck, CloudBees, Inc.
  cve: CVE-2019-1003037
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  plugins:

      previous: "0.8.0"
  description: |
    Azure VM Agents Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow administrators configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

    This functionality did not check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
    Those could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

    An enumeration of credentials IDs in this plugin now requires Overall/Administer permission.

  # TODO The code checks AncestorInPath, but I don't see when that would ever be the case.

    AppDynamics Dashboard Plugin now stores the password encrypted in the configuration files on disk and no longer transfers it to users viewing the configuration form in plain text.
    Existing jobs need to have their configuration saved for existing plain text passwords to be overwritten.

  title: SSRF and data modification vulnerability due to missing permission check in Bitbar Run-in-Cloud
  reporter: Viktor Gazdag
  cvss:
    severity: Medium

      previous: "2.69.1"
  description: |
    A missing permission check in a method performing both form validation and saving new configuration in Bitbar Run-in-Cloud Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read permission to have Jenkins master connect to an attacker-specified host with attacker-specified credentials, and, if successful, save that as the new configuration for the plugin. This could then potentially result in future builds submitting their data to an unauthorized remote server.

    Additionally, this method did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

    This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions.
