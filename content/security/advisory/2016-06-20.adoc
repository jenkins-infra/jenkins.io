=== Async HTTP Client Plugin does not properly validate certificates
*SECURITY-305 / CVE-2013-7397 and CVE-2013-7398*

Async HTTP Client Plugin provides the Async HTTP Client Java library to other plugins. It is based on the 1.7.x line of AHC, which by default is vulnerable to link:https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-7397[CVE-2013-7397] and link:https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2013-7398[CVE-2013-7398], allowing man-in-the-middle attacks. The fixes for these vulnerabilities were backported. The system property +jenkins.plugins.asynchttpclient.AHC.acceptAnyCertificate+ can temporarily be set to +true+ to disable these new validity checks. link:https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Features+controlled+by+system+properties[Learn more about system properties in Jenkins].
