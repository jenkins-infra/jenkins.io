  title: Lack of type validation in agent related REST API
  cve: CVE-2021-21639
  cvss:
    severity: Low
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    Jenkins 2.286 and earlier, LTS 2.277.1 and earlier does not validate the type of object created after loading the data submitted to the `config.xml` REST API endpoint of a node.

    This allows attackers with Computer/Configure permission to replace a node with one of a different type.

    Jenkins 2.287, LTS 2.277.2 validates the type of object created and rejects objects of unexpected types.

  title: View name validation bypass
  cve: CVE-2021-21640
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    Jenkins 2.286 and earlier, LTS 2.277.1 and earlier does not properly check that a newly created view has an allowed name.
    When a form to create a view is submitted, the name is included twice in the submission.
    One instance is validated, but the other instance is used to create the value.

    This allows attackers with View/Create permission to create views with invalid or already-used names.

    Jenkins 2.287, LTS 2.277.2 uses the same submitted value for validation and view creation.

  title: CSRF vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21641
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 3.9 and earlier does not require POST requests for HTTP endpoints implementing promotion (regular, forced, and re-execute), resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.

    These vulnerabilities allow attackers to promote builds.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.9.1 requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoints.

    NOTE: A security hardening since Jenkins 2.287 and LTS 2.277.2 prevents exploitation of this vulnerability.

  - name: promoted-builds
    previous: '3.9'
    fixed: 3.9.1

  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-22512 (CSRF), CVE-2021-22513 (permission check)
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 6.7 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods implementing form validation.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to attacker-specified URLs using attacker-specified username and password.

    Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 6.8 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation methods.

  title: Reflected XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-22510
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 6.7 and earlier does not escape user input in a form validation response.

    This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 6.8 escapes user input in the affected form validation response.

    NOTE: A security hardening since Jenkins 2.275 and LTS 2.263.2 prevents exploitation of this vulnerability.

  - name: hp-application-automation-tools-plugin

  title: SSL/TLS certificate validation unconditionally disabled by PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-22511
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 6.7 and earlier unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation for connections to Service Virtualization servers.

    PLUGIN_NAME 6.8 no longer disables SSL/TLS certificate validation unconditionally by default.
    It provides an option to disable SSL/TLS certification validation for connections to Service Virtualization servers.

  - name: hp-application-automation-tools-plugin
