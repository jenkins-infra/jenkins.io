  title: Reflected XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21648
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.3.18 and earlier does not escape user-controlled information on a view it provides.

    This results in a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.3.19 restricts the user-controlled information it provides to a safe subset.
  plugins:
  - name: credentials
    previous: 2.3.18
    fixed: 2.3.19

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21649
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.15 and earlier does not escape URLs referenced in Image Dashboard Portlets.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with View/Configure permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.16 does not render unsafe URLs.

    As part of this fix, the property for image URLs was changed from `url` to `imageUrl`.
    Existing https://plugins.jenkins.io/configuration-as-code/[Configuration as Code] configurations are still supported, but exports will emit the new property.

  title: Missing permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME allow obtaining metadata about artifacts
  cve: CVE-2021-21650
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 0.11.6 and earlier does not perform Run/Artifacts permission checks in various HTTP endpoints and API models.

    This allows attackers with Item/Read permission to obtain information about artifacts uploaded to S3, if the optional Run/Artifacts permission is enabled.

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.11.7 requires Run/Artifacts permission to obtain information about artifacts if this permission is enabled.
  plugins:
  - name: s3
    previous: 0.11.6
    fixed: 0.11.7
- id: SECURITY-2201
  title: Missing permission check in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21651
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 0.11.6 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to obtain the list of configured profiles.

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.11.7 performs permission checks when providing a list of configured profiles.
  plugins:
  - name: s3
    previous: 0.11.6
    fixed: 0.11.7

  title: CSRF vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME allows capturing credentials
  cve: CVE-2021-21652
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.4.0 and earlier does not require POST requests for a connection test method, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    This vulnerability allows attackers to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.4.1 requires POST requests for the affected connection test method.
  plugins:
  - name: xray-connector
    previous: 2.4.0
    fixed: 2.4.1
- id: SECURITY-2251 (2)

  title: Missing permission check in PLUGIN_NAME allows enumerating credentials IDs
  cve: CVE-2021-21653
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.4.0 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.
    Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

    An enumeration of credentials IDs in PLUGIN_NAME 2.4.1 requires the appropriate permissions.
  plugins:
  - name: xray-connector
    previous: 2.4.0
    fixed: 2.4.1

  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21654 (permission check), CVE-2021-21655 (CSRF)
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.11.4 and earlier does not perform permission checks in multiple HTTP endpoints implementing connection tests.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified Perforce server using attacker-specified username and password.

    Additionally, these HTTP endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.11.5 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer for the affected HTTP endpoints.
  plugins:
  - name: p4
    previous: 1.11.4
    fixed: 1.11.5
- id: SECURITY-2335

  title: XXE vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21656
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.0.14 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

    This allows attackers able to control the input files for the Xcode build step to have Jenkins parse a crafted Xcode Workspace File that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.0.15 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.
  plugins:
  - name: xcode-plugin
    previous: 2.0.14
    fixed: 2.0.15
