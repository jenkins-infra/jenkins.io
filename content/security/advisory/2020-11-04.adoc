  title: Login allowed with hardcoded password by PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2299
  cvss:
    severity: Critical
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME implements two separate modes: Integration with ADSI on Windows, and an OS agnostic LDAP-based mode.

    The LDAP-based mode in PLUGIN_NAME 2.19 and earlier shares code between user lookup and user authentication and distinguishes these behaviors through the use of a magic constant used in place of a real password.
    This allows attackers to log in as any user if the magic constant is used as the password in PLUGIN_NAME 2.19 and earlier.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.20 no longer uses a magic constant to distinguish between user lookup and user authentication.

  title: Login allowed with empty password by PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2300
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME implements two separate modes: Integration with ADSI on Windows, and an OS agnostic LDAP-based mode.

    The Windows/ADSI mode does not specifically prohibit use of empty passwords in PLUGIN_NAME 2.19 and earlier.
    If the Active Directory server allows the unauthenticated bind operation, this allows attackers to log in to Jenkins as any user by providing an empty password.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.20 prohibits the use of an empty password to log in.

  title: Authentication cache in PLUGIN_NAME allows logging in with any password
  cve: CVE-2020-2301
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME implements two separate modes: Integration with ADSI on Windows, and an OS agnostic LDAP-based mode.
    Optionally, to reduce lookup time, a cache can be configured to remember user lookups and user authentications.

    In PLUGIN_NAME 2.19 and earlier, when run in Windows/ADSI mode, the provided password was not used when looking up an applicable cache entry.
    This allows attackers to log in as any user using any password while a successful authentication of that user is still in the cache.

    As a workaround for this issue, the cache can be disabled.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.20 includes the provided password in cache entry lookup.

    Additionally, the Java system property `hudson.plugins.active_directory.CacheUtil.noCacheAuth` can be set to `true` to no longer cache user authentications.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.19 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to access the domain health check diagnostic page.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.20 requires Overall/Administer permission to access the domain health check diagnostic page.

  cvss:

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.19 and earlier does not require POST requests for multiple HTTP endpoints implementing connection and authentication tests, resulting in cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.

    This vulnerability allows attackers to perform connection tests, connecting to attacker-specified or previously configured Active Directory servers using attacker-specified credentials.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.20 requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoints.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.13.1 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

    This allows attackers able to control an agent process to have Jenkins parse a crafted changelog file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.13.2 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.27.3 and earlier includes a feature to replace placeholders in pod template and container template fields with environment variable values.

    This feature allows low-privilege users to access possibly sensitive Jenkins controller environment variables.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.27.4 disables this feature.

    NOTE: The Java system property `org.csanchez.jenkins.plugins.kubernetes.PodTemplateUtils.SUBSTITUTE_ENV` can be set to `true` to restore this feature.
