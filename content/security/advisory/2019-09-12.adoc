  title: System command execution vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2019-10392
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME accepts user-specified values as argument to an invocation of `git ls-remote` to validate the existence of a Git repository at the specified URL.
    This was implemented in a way that allowed attackers with Job/Configure permission to execute an arbitrary system command on the Jenkins master as the OS user that the Jenkins process is running as.

    PLUGIN_NAME now rejects repository URLs that do not appear to be valid URLs.
    Additionally, for versions of Git that support it, the repository URL argument is separated from option arguments using the `--` separator to prevent interpretation as an option.

    As of publication of this advisory, no update for users of prerelease versions of 3.x such as 3.0.0-rc is available.
    Users of PLUGIN_NAME 3.0.0-rc are advised to downgrade to 2.8.5 (and downgrade plugin:git[Git Plugin] from 4.0.0-rc to the latest 3.x release to resolve dependency problems).
  plugins:
  - name: git-client
    previous: 2.8.4
    fixed: 2.8.5

  title: Sandbox bypass vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2019-10393, CVE-2019-10394, CVE-2019-10399, CVE-2019-10400
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    Sandbox protection in PLUGIN_NAME could be circumvented through any of the following:

    * Crafted method names in method call expressions (CVE-2019-10393)
    * Crafted property names in property expressions on the left-hand side of assignment expressions (CVE-2019-10394)
    * Crafted property names in property expressions in increment and decrement expressions (CVE-2019-10399)
    * Crafted subexpressions in increment and decrement expressions not involving actual assignment (CVE-2019-10400)

    This allowed attackers able to specify and run sandboxed scripts to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins master JVM.

    These expressions are now subject to sandbox protection.

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2019-10395
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME did not escape values of environment variables shown on its views.
    This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the values of build environment variables, typically users with Job/Configure or Job/Build permission.

    Jenkins applies the missing escaping by default since 2.146 and LTS 2.138.2, so newer Jenkins releases are not affected by this vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME now escapes all variables displayed in its views.

  - name: build-environment
    previous: 1.6
    fixed: 1.7

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2019-10396
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME did not escape the build description on the Latest Builds View.
    This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the description of builds shown on that view.

    PLUGIN_NAME now applies the configured markup formatter to the build description, rendering it as it appears elsewhere in Jenkins.
  plugins:
  - name: dashboard-view
    previous: 2.11
    fixed: 2.12

  title: PLUGIN_NAME showed plain text password in job configuration form fields
  cve: CVE-2019-10397
  cvss:
    severity: Low
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME stores service passwords in job configurations.

    While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form.
    This could result in exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

    PLUGIN_NAME no longer transmits the password form field in plain text.

  title: PLUGIN_NAME stored credentials in plain text
  cve: CVE-2019-10398
  cvss:
    severity: Low
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME stored the Beaker password unencrypted on the Jenkins master.
    This password could be viewed by users with access to the master file system.

    PLUGIN_NAME now stores these credentials encrypted.
  plugins:
  - name: beaker-builder
    previous: 1.9
    fixed: '1.10'
