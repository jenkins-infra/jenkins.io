  description: |-
    Multiple Pipeline-related plugins that perform on-controller SCM checkouts reuse the same workspace directory for checkouts of distinct SCMs in some contexts.

    - plugin:workflow-cps[Pipeline: Groovy Plugin] 2648.va9433432b33c and earlier uses the same checkout directories for distinct SCMs when reading the script file (typically `Jenkinsfile`) for Pipelines.
    - plugin:workflow-cps-global-lib[Pipeline: Shared Groovy Libraries] 552.vd9cc05b8a2e1 and earlier uses the same checkout directories for distinct SCMs for Pipeline libraries.
    - plugin:workflow-multibranch[Pipeline: Multibranch] 706.vd43c65dec013 and earlier uses the same checkout directories for distinct SCMs for the `readTrusted` step.

    This allows attackers with Item/Configure permission to invoke arbitrary OS commands on the controller through crafted SCM contents.

    Affected plugins have been updated to address these issues:

    - plugin:workflow-cps[Pipeline: Groovy Plugin] 2656.vf7a_e7b_75a_457 uses distinct checkout directories per SCM when reading the script file (typically `Jenkinsfile`) for Pipelines.
    - plugin:workflow-cps-global-lib[Pipeline: Shared Groovy Libraries] 561.va_ce0de3c2d69 uses distinct checkout directories per SCM for Pipeline libraries.

    Multiple Pipeline-related plugins follow symbolic links or do not limit path names, resulting in arbitrary file read vulnerabilities:

    - plugin:workflow-cps[Pipeline: Groovy Plugin] 2648.va9433432b33c and earlier follows symbolic links to locations outside of the checkout directory for the configured SCM when reading the script file (typically `Jenkinsfile`) for Pipelines (originally reported as SECURITY-2595).
    - plugin:workflow-cps-global-lib[Pipeline: Shared Groovy Libraries] 552.vd9cc05b8a2e1 and earlier follows symbolic links to locations outside of the expected Pipeline library when reading files using the `libraryResource` step (originally reported as SECURITY-2479).
    - plugin:workflow-cps-global-lib[Pipeline: Shared Groovy Libraries] 552.vd9cc05b8a2e1 and earlier does not restrict the names of resources passed to the `libraryResource` step (originally reported as SECURITY-2476).
    - plugin:workflow-multibranch[Pipeline: Multibranch] 706.vd43c65dec013 and earlier follows symbolic links to locations outside of the checkout directory for the configured SCM when reading files using the `readTrusted` step (originally reported as SECURITY-2491).

    This allows attackers able to configure Pipelines to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system.

    Affected plugins have been updated to address these issues:

    - plugin:workflow-cps[Pipeline: Groovy Plugin] 2656.vf7a_e7b_75a_457 checks that the script file for Pipelines is inside of the checkout directory for the configured SCM.
    - plugin:workflow-cps-global-lib[Pipeline: Shared Groovy Libraries] 561.va_ce0de3c2d69 checks that any resources retrieved by the `libraryResource` step are contained within the expected Pipeline library.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.20 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to have Jenkins send an HTTP request to an attacker-controlled URL and have it parse the response as XML.

    As the plugin does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks, attackers can have Jenkins parse a crafted XML response that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

    Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix. link:/security/plugins/#unresolved[Learn why we announce this.]

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.1 and earlier uses static fields to store job configuration information.

    This allows attackers with Item/Configure permission to capture passwords of the jobs that will be configured.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.2.6 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

    Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
