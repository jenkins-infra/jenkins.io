  title: Sandbox bypass vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2134 (constructors), CVE-2020-2135 (GroovyInterceptable)
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    Sandbox protection in PLUGIN_NAME 1.70 and earlier can be circumvented through:

    * Crafted constructor calls and bodies (due to an incomplete fix of https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2017-08-07/#super-constructor-calls[SECURITY-582])
    * Crafted method calls on objects that implement `GroovyInterceptable`

    This allows attackers able to specify and run sandboxed scripts to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins master JVM.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.71 has additional restrictions and sanity checks to ensure that super constructors cannot be constructed without being intercepted by the sandbox.
    In addition, it also intercepts method calls on objects that implement `GroovyInterceptable` as calls to `GroovyObject#invokeMethod(String, Object)`, which is on the list of dangerous signatures and should not be approved for use in the sandbox.

    This allows a user able to control the input files for the 'Publish Cobertura Coverage Report' post-build step to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins master or server-side request forgery.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.16 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.

    This allows users with Overall/Read access to trigger builds or add labels in the Perforce repository.

    Additionally, these endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.10.11 requires POST requests and appropriate user permissions for the affected HTTP endpoints.

    PLUGIN_NAME stores credentials in its global configuration file `jenkins.plugins.logstash.LogstashConfiguration.xml` on the Jenkins master as part of its configuration.

    This can result in exposure of the credential through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.1.0 and earlier does not use SSH host key validation when connecting to Mac Cloud host launched by the plugin.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.1.0 and earlier does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
    This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified SSH host using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

    Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    This form validation method requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission in PLUGIN_NAME 1.2.0.
