  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in help icons
  cve: CVE-2020-2229
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    Jenkins 2.251 and earlier, LTS 2.235.3 and earlier does not escape the tooltip content of help icons.
    Tooltip values can be contributed by plugins, some of which use user-specified values.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

    Jenkins 2.252, LTS 2.235.4 escapes the tooltip content of help icons.

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in project naming strategy
  cve: CVE-2020-2230
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    Jenkins 2.251 and earlier, LTS 2.235.3 and earlier does not escape the project naming strategy description that is displayed on item creation.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users with Overall/Manage permission.

    Jenkins 2.252, LTS 2.235.4 escapes the project naming strategy description.

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in 'Trigger builds remotely'
  cve: CVE-2020-2231
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    Jenkins 2.251 and earlier, LTS 2.235.3 and earlier does not escape the remote address of the host starting a build via 'Trigger builds remotely'.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users with Job/Configure permission or knowledge of the Authentication Token.

    Jenkins 2.252, LTS 2.235.4 escapes the remote address of the host.

  title: SMTP password transmitted and displayed in plain text by PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2232
  cvss:
    severity: Low
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME stores an SMTP password in its global configuration file `hudson.plugins.emailext.ExtendedEmailPublisher.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

    While this password is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted and displayed in plain text as part of the configuration form by PLUGIN_NAME 2.72 and 2.73.
    This can result in exposure of the password.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.74 transmits the SMTP password in its global configuration encrypted and masks it using a password field.
  plugins:
  - name: email-ext
    previous: '2.73'
    fixed: '2.74'

  title: Missing permission check in PLUGIN_NAME allows enumerating credentials IDs
  cve: CVE-2020-2233
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 3.8.2 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to enumerate credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins. Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

    An enumeration of credentials IDs in PLUGIN_NAME 3.8.3 requires the appropriate permissions.
  plugins:
  - name: pipeline-maven
    previous: 3.8.2
    fixed: 3.8.3
- id: SECURITY-1794 (2)

  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in PLUGIN_NAME allow capturing
    credentials
  cve: CVE-2020-2234 (permission check), CVE-2020-2235 (CSRF)
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 3.8.2 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.

    This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified JDBC URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, potentially capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

    Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.8.3 requires POST requests and Job/Configure permission for the affected form validation method.
  plugins:
  - name: pipeline-maven
    previous: 3.8.2
    fixed: 3.8.3

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2236
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.11 and earlier does not escape tooltip content.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by users with Run/Update permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.12 escapes tooltip content.
  plugins:
  - name: yet-another-build-visualizer
    previous: '1.11'
    fixed: '1.12'
- id: SECURITY-1763
  reporter: Wadeck Follonier, CloudBees, Inc.
  title: CSRF vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2237
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.0.4 and earlier does not require POST requests for the "Deflake this build" feature, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    This vulnerability allows attackers to rebuild a project at a previous git revision where the tests were failing.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
  plugins:
  - name: flaky-test-handler
    previous: 1.0.4
