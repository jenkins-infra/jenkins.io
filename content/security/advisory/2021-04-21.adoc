  title: XXE vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21642
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 3.7.0 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

    This allows attackers with the ability to define Maven configuration files to have Jenkins parse a crafted configuration file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.7.1 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.

  title: Incorrect permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME allow enumerating credentials
    IDs
  cve: CVE-2021-21643
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 3.7.0 and earlier does not correctly perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

    This allows attackers with global Job/Configure permission to enumerate system-scoped credentials IDs of credentials stored in Jenkins.
    Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

    An enumeration of system-scoped credentials IDs in PLUGIN_NAME 3.7.1 requires Overall/Administer permission.

  - name: config-file-provider

  title: CSRF vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME allows deleting configuration files
  cve: CVE-2021-21644
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 3.7.0 and earlier does not require POST requests for an HTTP endpoint, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    This vulnerability allows attackers to delete configuration files corresponding to an attacker-specified ID.

    This is due to an incomplete fix of link:/security/advisory/2018-09-25/#SECURITY-938[SECURITY-938].

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.7.1 requires POST requests for the affected HTTP endpoint.
  plugins:
  - name: config-file-provider
    previous: 3.7.0
    fixed: 3.7.1

  title: Missing permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME allow enumerating configuration
    file IDs
  cve: CVE-2021-21645
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 3.7.0 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate configuration file IDs.

    An enumeration of configuration file IDs in PLUGIN_NAME 3.7.1 requires the appropriate permissions.

  - name: config-file-provider

  title: Remote code execution vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2021-21646
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.1 and earlier does not protect its pipeline configurations using Script Security Plugin.

    This vulnerability allows attackers with Job/Configure permission to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.2 integrates with Script Security Plugin to protect its pipeline configurations.

  - name: templating-engine
    previous: '2.1'
    fixed: '2.2'

  title: Missing permission check in PLUGIN_NAME allows scheduling builds
  cve: CVE-2021-21647
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.1.21 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

    This allows attackers with Item/Read permission to schedule builds of projects without having Item/Build permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.1.22 requires Item/Build permission to schedule builds via its HTTP endpoint.
  plugins:
  - name: electricflow
    previous: 1.1.21
    fixed: 1.1.22
