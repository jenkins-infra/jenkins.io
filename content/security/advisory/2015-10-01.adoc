*Updated 2015-10-13*: The `/script` URL appears to be how machines get infected. Clarified that enabling security isn't enough, anonymous users must not be able to run scripts.

===  Description

The Jenkins project has received multiple credible reports indicating that unsecured, publicly accessible instances of Jenkins are being targeted and infected with malware. This advisory publishes the information we have about this situation and may be updated once we learn more.

By default, Jenkins listens to all interfaces and does not require user authentication, allowing anyone on the network to run arbitrary processes as the user running Jenkins. *If you're running a Jenkins instance on a public network, make sure security is enabled, and that anonymous users have read access at most.* To do this, link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Standard+Security+Setup[follow the instructions in the Jenkins wiki].

While this is not a bug in Jenkins, we are planning to change the Jenkins setup in a future release to be secure by default to prevent something like this from occurring in the future.

===  Infections

Reports indicate that affected machines have one or more of these files in their Jenkins home directory (e.g. `/var/lib/jenkins`):

- RcsHTone
- XiosElom
- XiosElomL

According to some reports, the malware uses the `/script` URL to install the malware on affected machines, i.e. it is using regular Jenkins functionality.

We currently neither know the exact nature of this malware, nor how to remove it.

===  Fix

If you're running a Jenkins instance on a public network, link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Standard+Security+Setup[follow the instructions in the Jenkins wiki] to set up security on your Jenkins instance.

It is important that it is _not_ possible for anonymous users to perform administrative actions or run scripts. This means:

* Do *not* use the _Anyone can do anything_ authorization strategy.
* Do *not* use the _Logged-in users can do anything_ authorization strategy while allowing users to sign up when using _Jenkins’ own user database_.
* Do *not* give significant permissions (beyond read access) to the _authenticated_ group when using a more complex authorization strategy such as _Matrix-based security_ while allowing users to sign up when using _Jenkins’ own user database_.
