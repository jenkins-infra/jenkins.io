  reporter: Nils Emmerich of ERNW Research GmbH
  title: Sandbox bypass vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2019-16538
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    Sandbox protection in PLUGIN_NAME could be circumvented through closure default parameter expressions.

    This allowed attackers able to specify and run sandboxed scripts to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins master JVM.

    These expressions are now subject to sandbox protection.
  plugins:
  - name: script-security
    previous: '1.67'
    fixed: '1.68'

  title: PLUGIN_NAME allowed users with Overall/Read permission to delete arbitrary files
  cve: CVE-2019-16539 (permission check), CVE-2019-16540 (path traversal)
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME did not validate the paths submitted for the "Delete Support Bundles" feature.
    This allowed users to delete arbitrary files on the Jenkins master file system accessible to the OS user account running Jenkins.

    Additionally, this endpoint did not perform a permission check, allowing users with Overall/Read permission to delete support bundles, and any arbitrary other file, with a known name/path.

    PLUGIN_NAME now only allows the deletion of support bundles and related files listed on the UI through this feature.
    It also ensures that only users with "Download Bundle" permission are able to delete support bundles.
  plugins:
  - name: support-core
    previous: '2.63'
    fixed: '2.64'

  title: Folder-scoped Jira sites in PLUGIN_NAME were able to access System-scoped credentials
  cve: CVE-2019-16541
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME allows the definition of per-folder Jira sites.

    The credentials lookup for this feature did not set the appropriate context, allowing the use of System-scoped credentials otherwise reserved for use in the global configuration.
    This allowed users with Item/Configure permission on the folder to access credentials they're not entitled to, and potentially capture them.

    PLUGIN_NAME now defines the appropriate folder context for credential lookup.
    As a side effect, existing per-folder Jira sites may lose access to already configured System-scoped credentials, as if no credential was specified in the first place.
  plugins:
  - name: jira
    previous: '3.0.10'
    fixed: '3.0.11'


# Other plugins with fixed issues

  reporter: James Holderness, IB Boost
  title: PLUGIN_NAME stored credentials in plain text
  cve: CVE-2019-16542
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME stored an Anchore.io service password unencrypted in job `config.xml` files as part of its configuration.
    This credential could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the master file system.

    As the affected functionality has been deprecated, and the affected Anchore.io service has been shut down in late 2018, the affected feature has been removed.
    The password will be removed from the job configuration once it is saved again.
  plugins:
  - name: anchore-container-scanner
    previous: '1.0.19'
    fixed: '1.0.20'


- id: SECURITY-1554
  reporter: James Holderness, IB Boost
  title: PLUGIN_NAME stored credentials in plain text
  cve: CVE-2019-16543
  cvss:
    severity: Low
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME stored a credential unencrypted in its global configuration file `com.inflectra.spiratest.plugins.SpiraBuilder.xml` on the Jenkins master.
    This credential could be viewed by users with access to the master file system.

    PLUGIN_NAME now stores this credential encrypted once its configuration is saved again.
  plugins:
  - name: inflectra-spira-integration
    previous: '3.2.2'
    fixed: '3.2.3'

  title: PLUGIN_NAME did not verify SSH host keys
  cve: CVE-2019-16546
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME did not use SSH host key verification when connecting to VMs launched by the plugin.
    This lack of verification could be abused by a MitM attacker to intercept these connections to attacker-specified build agents without warning.

    PLUGIN_NAME now verifies SSH host keys before executing any commands on agents.
  plugins:
  - name: google-compute-engine
    previous: '4.1.1'
    fixed: '4.2.0'


- id: SECURITY-1585
  reporter: Matt Sicker, CloudBees, Inc.
  title: PLUGIN_NAME disclosed environment information to users with Overall/Read permission
  cve: CVE-2019-16547
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME did not verify permissions on multiple auto-complete API endpoints.
    This allowed users with Overall/Read permissions to view various metadata about the running cloud environment.

    PLUGIN_NAME now requires the appropriate Job/Configure permission to view these metadata.
  plugins:
  - name: google-compute-engine
    previous: '4.1.1'
    fixed: '4.2.0'

  title: CSRF vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME allowed provisioning agents
  cve: CVE-2019-16548
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME did not require POST requests on an API endpoint.
    This CSRF vulnerability allowed attackers to provision new agents.

    PLUGIN_NAME now requires POST requests for this API endpoint.
  plugins:
  - name: google-compute-engine
    previous: '4.1.1'
    fixed: '4.2.0'

  title: PLUGIN_NAME stored credentials in plain text
  cve: CVE-2019-16544
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME stored credentials unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins master as part of its post-build step configuration.
    This credential could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the master file system.

    PLUGIN_NAME now stores these credentials encrypted once the job configuration is saved again.

  title: PLUGIN_NAME shows plain text password in configuration form
  cve: CVE-2019-16545
  cvss:
    severity: Low
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME stores a credential as part of its post-build step configuration.

    While the password is stored encrypted on disk since PLUGIN_NAME 1.13, it is transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form.
    This can result in exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
  plugins:
  - name: qmetry-for-jira-test-management
