  title: Improper authorization due to caching in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2286
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.12 and newer uses a cache to speed up permission lookups.

    In PLUGIN_NAME 3.0 and earlier this cache is not invalidated properly when an administrator changes the permission configuration.
    This can result in permissions being granted long after the configuration was changed to no longer grant them.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.1 properly invalidates the cache on configuration changes.

  title: Request logging could be bypassed in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2287
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME logs requests whose URL path matches an admin-configured regular expression.

    A discrepancy between the behavior of the plugin and the Stapler web framework in parsing URL paths allows attackers to craft URLs that would bypass request logging in PLUGIN_NAME 3.6 and earlier.
    This only applies to Jenkins 2.227 and earlier, LTS 2.204.5 and earlier, as the fix for link:/security/advisory/2020-03-25/#SECURITY-1774[SECURITY-1774] prohibits dispatch of affected requests.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.7 processes request URL paths the same way as the Stapler web framework.

  title: Incorrect default pattern in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2288
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME uses regular expressions to match requested URLs whose dispatch should be logged.

    In PLUGIN_NAME 3.6 and earlier, the default regular expression pattern could be bypassed in many cases by adding a suffix to the URL that would be ignored during request handling.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.7 changes the default regular expression pattern so that it allows for arbitrary suffixes.
    It automatically will replace previous default patterns with the new, more complete default pattern.

    Additionally, an administrative monitor is shown if a user-specified pattern is found to be bypassable through crafted URLs and form validation was improved to recognize patterns that would not match requests with arbitrary suffixes.

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.4 and earlier does not escape the name and description of build parameters.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.5 escapes the name of build parameters and applies the configured markup formatter to the description of build parameters.

  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2020-2290

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.4 and earlier does not escape `List` and `Map` return values of sandboxed scripts for _Reactive Reference Parameter_.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Job/Configure permission.

    This issue is caused by an incomplete fix for link:/security/advisory/2017-10-23/#persisted-cross-site-scripting-vulnerability-in-active-choices-plugin[SECURITY-470].

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.5 escapes all legal return values of sandboxed scripts.

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.3 and earlier stores its server password unencrypted in its global configuration file `org.jenkinsci.plugins.couchstats.CouchStatsConfig.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

    This password can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.4 stores its server password encrypted once its configuration is saved again.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.10.2 and earlier does not escape the release version in the badge tooltip.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Release/Release permission.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.3.2 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to start cascade builds and layout builds, and reconfigure the plugin.

    Additionally, these endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.44 and earlier does not require POST requests for an HTTP endpoint, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    This vulnerability allows attackers to configure shared objects.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.2 and earlier stores an access token unencrypted in its global configuration file `com.hoiio.jenkins.plugin.SMSNotification.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

    This access token can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

  title: XXE vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME

  cvss:
    severity: High

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.02.06 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to have Jenkins parse a crafted HTTP request with XML data that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

    Additionally, XML parsing is exposed as a form validation endpoint that does not require POST requests, allowing exploitation by users without Overall/Read permission via CSRF.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
