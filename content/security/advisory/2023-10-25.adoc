  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-46650
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.37.3 and earlier does not escape the GitHub project URL on the build page when showing changes.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.37.3.1 escapes GitHub project URL on the build page when showing changes.
  plugins:
  - name: github
    previous: 1.37.3
    fixed: 1.37.3.1

  title: Exposure of system-scoped credentials in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-46651
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 10.5.0 and earlier does not set the appropriate context for credentials lookup, allowing the use of system-scoped credentials otherwise reserved for the global configuration.

    This allows attackers with Item/Configure permission to access and capture credentials they are not entitled to.

    PLUGIN_NAME 10.5.1 defines the appropriate context for credentials lookup.

  - name: warnings-ng
    previous: 10.5.0

  title: Missing permission check in PLUGIN_NAME allows enumerating credentials IDs
  cve: CVE-2023-46652
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.20.9 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials IDs of LAMBDATEST credentials stored in Jenkins.
    Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

    An enumeration of credentials IDs in PLUGIN_NAME 1.20.10 requires Overall/Administer permission.

  - name: lambdatest-automation
    previous: 1.20.9
    fixed: 1.20.10

  title: Exposure of token through logs in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-46653
  cvss:
    severity: Low
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.20.10 and earlier logs LAMBDATEST Credentials access token at the INFO level.

    This can result in accidental exposure of the token through the default system log.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.21.0 no longer logs LAMBDATEST Credentials access token.
  plugins:
  - name: lambdatest-automation
    previous: 1.20.10

  title: Arbitrary file deletion vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-46654
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    In PLUGIN_NAME, artifacts that were previously copied from an agent to the controller are deleted after publishing by the 'CloudBees CD - Publish Artifact' post-build step.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.1.32 and earlier follows symbolic links to locations outside of the expected directory during this cleanup process.

    This allows attackers able to configure jobs to delete arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.1.33 deletes symbolic links without following them.
  plugins:
  - name: electricflow
    previous: 1.1.32
    fixed: 1.1.33
- id: SECURITY-3238

  title: Arbitrary file read vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-46655
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME temporarily copies files from an agent workspace to the controller in preparation for publishing them in the 'CloudBees CD - Publish Artifact' post-build step.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.1.32 and earlier follows symbolic links to locations outside of the temporary directory on the controller when collecting the list of files to publish.

    This allows attackers able to configure jobs to publish arbitrary files from the Jenkins controller file system to the previously configured CloudBees CD server.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.1.33 ensures that only files located within the expected directory are published.

  - name: electricflow
    previous: 1.1.32

  title: Non-constant time webhook token comparison in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-46656
  cvss:
    severity: Low
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.0.9 and earlier does not use a constant-time comparison when checking whether the provided and expected webhook token are equal.

    This could potentially allow attackers to use statistical methods to obtain a valid webhook token.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.13 and earlier does not escape the Trac website URL on the build page.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers with Item/Configure permission.

    PLUGIN_NAME 0.6 and earlier does not use a constant-time comparison when checking whether the provided and expected webhook token hashes are equal.
