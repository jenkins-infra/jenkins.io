  title: DoS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-5072
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 11.11.0 and earlier bundles versions of JSON-Java vulnerable to https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-5072[CVE-2023-5072].

    This may allow attackers able to control input to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by parsing a crafted JSON document.

    NOTE: As of publication, plugin:synopsys-sigma[Synopsys Rapid Scan Static] is the only plugin the Jenkins security team is aware of whose report parser is potentially affected.

    PLUGIN_NAME 11.13.0 updates JSON-Java to version 20231013, which is unaffected by this issue.

  title: Arbitrary file deletion vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-50764
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 342.v6a_89fd40f466 and earlier does not restrict a file name query parameter in an HTTP endpoint.

    This allows attackers with Scriptler/Configure permission to delete arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system.

    PLUGIN_NAME 344.v5a_ddb_5f9e685 ensures that the file being deleted is located in the expected directory.

  title: Missing permission check in PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-50765

    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 342.v6a_89fd40f466 and earlier does not perform a permission check in an HTTP endpoint.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to read the contents of a Groovy script by knowing its ID.

    PLUGIN_NAME 344.v5a_ddb_5f9e685 requires the appropriate permission to read the contents of a Groovy script.

  title: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in PLUGIN_NAME allow XXE
  cve: CVE-2023-50766 (CSRF), CVE-2023-50767 (missing permission check)
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 3.18.0-03 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods implementing form validation.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to send an HTTP request to an attacker-specified URL and parse the response as XML.

    Additionally, the plugin does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks, so attackers can have Jenkins parse a crafted XML response that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

    Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.18.1-01 configures its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

    Additionally, POST requests and Overall/Administer permission are required for the affected HTTP endpoints.

    NOTE: PLUGIN_NAME is not currently distributed by the Jenkins Project due to licensing issues.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 3.18.0-03 and earlier does not perform permission checks in methods implementing form validation.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified HTTP server using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

    Additionally, these form validation methods do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.18.1-01 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation methods.

  title: Password stored in a recoverable format by PLUGIN_NAME
  cve: CVE-2023-50770
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME provides an anti-lockout feature, which allows administrators to define a local user account that can be used to recover access to Jenkins.

    In PLUGIN_NAME 2.6 and earlier the password to that account is stored in a recoverable format.

    This allows attackers with access to the Jenkins controller file system to recover the plain text password of that account, likely gaining administrator access to Jenkins.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

  title: Open redirect vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME

  cvss:

    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N
  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.6 and earlier improperly determines that a redirect URL after login is legitimately pointing to Jenkins.

    This allows attackers to perform phishing attacks by having users go to a Jenkins URL that will forward them to a different site after successful authentication.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 2.0 and earlier stores access tokens unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

    These tokens can be viewed by users with Item/Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

    Additionally, the job configuration form does not mask these tokens, increasing the potential for attackers to observe and capture them.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.0.4 and earlier does not perform permission checks in several HTTP endpoints.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified URL using an attacker-specified token.
