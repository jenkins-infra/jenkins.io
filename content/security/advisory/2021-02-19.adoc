  title: Privilege escalation vulnerability in bundled Spring Security library
  cve: CVE-2021-22112
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    Spring Security 5.4.3 and earlier has a vulnerability that unintentionally persists temporarily elevated privileges in some circumstances in a user's session.
    This issue, CVE-2021-22112, is resolved in Spring Security 5.4.4.

    Jenkins 2.266 through 2.279 (inclusive) includes releases of Spring Security with this vulnerability.

    We are aware of a sequence of operations in Jenkins 2.275 through 2.278 (inclusive) that allows attackers with Job/Workspace permission to exploit this to switch their identity to SYSTEM, an internal user with all permissions.

    Jenkins 2.280 integrates Spring Security 5.4.4, which includes a fix for CVE-2021-22112.

    We recommend that all Jenkins instances running Jenkins releases 2.266 through 2.279 (inclusive) are upgraded to 2.280.
    Administrators of instances running Jenkins releases 2.275 through 2.278 (inclusive) who cannot upgrade to a fixed version are advised to apply the short-term workaround of removing Job/Workspace permission from all non-admin users.
