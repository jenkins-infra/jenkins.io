  title: XSS vulnerability
  cve: CVE-2022-41224
  cvss:
    severity: High
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
  description: |-
    Jenkins 2.367 through 2.369 (both inclusive) does not escape tooltips of the `l:helpIcon` UI component used for some help icons on the Jenkins web UI.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control tooltips for this component.

    NOTE: As of publication, the Jenkins security team is unaware of any exploitable help icon/tooltip in Jenkins core or plugins published by the Jenkins project.
    The vast majority of help icons use the `l:help` component instead of `l:helpIcon`.
    The few known instances of `l:helpIcon` do not have user-controllable tooltip contents.

    Jenkins 2.370 escapes tooltips of the `l:helpIcon` UI component.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.0.14 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

    This allows attackers able to change the contents of the Topaz Workbench CLI home directory on agents to have Jenkins parse a crafted file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.0.15 disables external entity resolution for its XML parser.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 4.8.0.129 and earlier does not perform a permission check in a method implementing form validation.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to connect to an attacker-specified webserver using attacker-specified username and password.

    Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    PLUGIN_NAME 4.8.0.130 requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission for the affected form validation method.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1.22 and earlier allows attackers with Item/Configure permission to create or replace any `config.xml` file on the Jenkins controller file system by providing a crafted file name to an API endpoint.

    Additionally, this endpoint does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability that allows attackers to replace any config.xml file on the Jenkins controller file system with an empty file.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

    PLUGIN_NAME 3.6.11 and earlier does not perform Run/Artifacts permission checks in multiple HTTP endpoints.

    This allows attackers with Item/Read permission to obtain information about build artifacts of a given job, if the optional Run/Artifacts permission is enabled.

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1.0.2 and earlier implements functionality that allows agent processes to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system.

    This allows attackers able to control agent processes to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller file system.

    NOTE: This vulnerability is only exploitable in Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier.
    See the link:/doc/upgrade-guide/2.303/#upgrading-to-jenkins-lts-2-303-3[LTS upgrade guide].

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 117.v6eecc36919c2 and earlier does not require POST requests for an HTTP endpoint, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    This vulnerability allows attackers to replace the generated report stored in a per-session cache and displayed to authorized users at the `.../report` URL with a report based on attacker-specified report generation options.
    This could create confusion in users of the plugin who are expecting to see a different result.

    NOTE: A security hardening since Jenkins 2.287 and LTS 2.277.2 prevents exploitation of this vulnerability for the _Single user, multiple jobs_ report.
    Other report types are still affected.

    As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

    PLUGIN_NAME provides a webhook endpoint at `/githook/` that can be used to trigger builds of the job for a GitHub repository.

    In PLUGIN_NAME 2.40.00 and earlier, this endpoint can be accessed without authentication.

    This allows unauthenticated attackers to trigger builds of jobs corresponding to the attacker-specified repository for attacker-specified commits.
