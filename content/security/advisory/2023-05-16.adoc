  title: Stored XSS vulnerability in PLUGIN_NAME

  description: |-
    PLUGIN_NAME 1292.v27d8cc3e2602 and earlier does not escape the display name of the build that caused an earlier build to be aborted, when "Do not allow concurrent builds" is set.

    This results in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to set build display names immediately.

    NOTE: The Jenkins security team is not aware of any plugins that allow the exploitation of this vulnerability, as the build name must be set before the build starts.

    PLUGIN_NAME 1295.v395eb_7400005 escapes the display name of the build that caused an earlier build to be aborted.

    PLUGIN_NAME 204.v8191fd551eb_f and earlier stores these extra variables unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.

    These extra variables can be viewed by users with Item/Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

    Additionally, the job configuration form does not mask these extra variables, increasing the potential for attackers to observe and capture them.

    PLUGIN_NAME 205.v4cb_c48657c21 masks extra variables displayed on the configuration form, and stores them encrypted once job configurations are saved again.

    PLUGIN_NAME 2.0.2 and earlier does not perform permission checks in multiple HTTP endpoints.

    This allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to send an HTTP request to an attacker-specified URL and parse the response as XML, or parse a local file on the Jenkins controller as XML.

    As the plugin does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks, attackers can have Jenkins parse a crafted XML response that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.

    Additionally, these HTTP endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

    * The credentials are printed in build steps executing on an agent (typically inside a `node` block).
    * Push mode for durable task logging is enabled.
      This is a hidden option in https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-durable-task-step/[Pipeline: Nodes and Processes] that can be enabled through the https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/system-properties/[Java system property] `org.jenkinsci.plugins.workflow.steps.durable_task.DurableTaskStep.USE_WATCHING`.
      It is also automatically enabled by some plugins, e.g., https://plugins.jenkins.io/opentelemetry/[OpenTelemetry] and https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-cloudwatch-logs/[Pipeline Logging over CloudWatch].

    NOTE: An improvement in https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials-binding/[Credentials Binding] 523.525.vb_72269281873 implements a workaround that applies build log masking even in affected plugins.
    This workaround is temporary and potentially incomplete, so it is still recommended that affected plugins be updated to resolve this issue.
