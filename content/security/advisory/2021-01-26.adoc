  title: Arbitrary file read vulnerability in workspace browsers
  cve: CVE-2021-21615
  cvss:
    severity: Medium
    vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N
  description: |-
    Due to a time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition, the file browser for workspaces, archived artifacts, and `$JENKINS_HOME/userContent/` follows symbolic links to locations outside the directory being browsed in Jenkins 2.275 and LTS 2.263.2.

    This allows attackers with Job/Workspace permission and the ability to control workspace contents, e.g., with Job/Configure permission or the ability to change SCM contents, to create symbolic links that allow them to access files outside workspaces using the workspace browser.

    NOTE: This issue is caused by an incorrectly applied fix for SECURITY-1452 / CVE-2021-21602 in the link:/security/advisory/2021-01-13/#SECURITY-1452[2021-01-13 security advisory].

    Jenkins 2.276, LTS 2.263.3 no longer differentiates the check and the use of symlinks in workspace browsers.
