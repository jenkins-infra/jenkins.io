kind: core and plugin

This advisory announces:

* multiple security vulnerabilities that were found in Jenkins core.
* two security vulnerabilities found in plugin:monitoring[the monitoring plugin]

== Description
=== SECURITY-87/CVE-2014-3661 (anonymous DoS attack through CLI handshake)
This vulnerability allows unauthenticated users with access to Jenkins' HTTP/HTTPS port to mount a DoS attack on Jenkins through thread exhaustion.

=== SECURITY-110/CVE-2014-3662 (User name discovery)
Anonymous users can test if the user of a specific name exists or not through login attempts.

=== SECURITY-127&128/CVE-2014-3663 (privilege escalation in job configuration permission)
An user with a permission limited to Job/CONFIGURE can exploit this vulnerability to effectively create a new job, which should have been only possible for users with Job/CREATE permission, or to destroy jobs that he/she does not have access otherwise.

=== SECURITY-131/CVE-2014-3664 (directory traversal attack)
Users with Overall/READ permission can access arbitrary files in the file system readable by the Jenkins process, resulting in the exposure of sensitive information, such as encryption keys.

=== SECURITY-138/CVE-2014-3680 (Password exposure in DOM)
If a parameterized job has a default value in a password field, that default value gets exposed to users with Job/READ permission.

=== SECURITY-143/CVE-2014-3681 (XSS vulnerability in Jenkins core)
Reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in Jenkins core. An attacker can navigate the user to a carefully crafted URL and have the user execute unintended actions.

=== SECURITY-150/CVE-2014-3666 (remote code execution from CLI)
Unauthenticated user can execute arbitrary code on Jenkins master by sending carefully crafted packets over the CLI channel.

=== SECURITY-155/CVE-2014-3667 (exposure of plugin code)
Programs that constitute plugins can be downloaded by anyone with the Overall/READ permission, resulting in the exposure of otherwise sensitive information, such as hard-coded keys in plugins, if any.

=== SECURITY-159/CVE-2013-2186 (arbitrary file system write)
Security vulnerability in commons fileupload allows unauthenticated attacker to upload arbitrary files to Jenkins master.

=== SECURITY-149/CVE-2014-1869 (XSS vulnerabilities in ZeroClipboard)
reflective XSS vulnerability in one of the library dependencies of Jenkins.

=== SECURITY-113/CVE-2014-3678 (XSS vulnerabilities in monitoring plugin)
Monitoring plugin allows an attacker to cause a victim into executing unwanted actions on Jenkins instance.

=== SECURITY-113/CVE-2014-3679 (hole in access control)
Certain pages in monitoring plugin are visible to anonymous users, allowing them to gain information that they are not supposed to.

== Severity
SECURITY-87 is rated *medium*, as it results in the loss of functionality.

SECURITY-110 is rated *medium*, as it results in a limited amount of information exposure.

SECURITY-127 and SECURITY-128 are rated *high*. The former can be used to further escalate privileges, and the latter results in loss of data.

SECURITY-131 and SECURITY-138 is rated *critical*. This vulnerabilities results in exposure of sensitie information and is easily exploitable.

SECURITY-143 is rated *high*. It is a passive attack, but it can result in a compromise of Jenkins master or loss of data.

SECURITY-150 is rated *critical*. This attack can be mounted by any unauthenticated anonymous user with HTTP reachability to Jenkins instance, and results in remote code execution on Jenkins.

SECURITY-155 is rated *medium*. This only affects users who have installed proprietary plugins on publicly accessible instances, which is relatively uncommon.

SECURITY-159 is rated *critical*. This attack can be mounted by any unauthenticated anonymous user with HTTP reachability to Jenkins instance.

SECURITY-113 is rated *high*. It is a passive attack, but it can result in a compromise of Jenkins master or loss of data.

== Affected Versions
* All the Jenkins releases <= 1.582
* All the LTS releases <= 1.565.2
* Monitoring plugin <= 1.52.1

== Credit
The Jenkins project would like to thank the following people for finding the vulnerabilities:

* Daniel Beck for finding SECURITY-87, SECURITY-110, SECURITY-127, SECURITY-128
* Jesse Glick for finding SECUIRTY-131, SECURITY-155
* Matthias Schmalz for finding SECURITY-138
* Seth Graham for finding SECURITY-143
* Stephen Connolly for finding SECURITY-150
* Manfred Moser for finding SECURITY-159
* Wilder Rodrigues for finding SECURITY-113
* Kurt Seifried for finding SECURITY-149

== Fix
* Main line users should upgrade to Jenkins 1.583
* LTS users should upgrade to 1.565.3
* User of monitoring plugin should upgrade to 1.53

These versions include fixes to all the vulnerabilities described above. All the prior versions are affected by these vulnerabilities.
