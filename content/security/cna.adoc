The Jenkins project is a link:https://cve.mitre.org/[CVE Numbers Authority] (CNA) for Jenkins and Jenkins plugins published by the Jenkins project (listed on https://plugins.jenkins.io/[plugins.jenkins.io] and/or hosted in https://github.com/jenkinsci[the jenkinsci GitHub organization]).
This means that the Jenkins project assigns https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures[CVE IDs] for vulnerabilities in these components.
