The Jenkins project is a link:https://cve.mitre.org/[CVE Numbers Authority] (CNA) for Jenkins and Jenkins plugins published by the Jenkins project (listed on https://plugins.jenkins.io/[plugins.jenkins.io] and/or hosted in https://github.com/jenkinsci[the jenkinsci GitHub organization]).
This means that the Jenkins project assigns https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures[CVE IDs] for vulnerabilities in these components.

## CNA scope and coordination

Determining whether there is another CNA for a specific component can be challenging, especially if the companies have changed names, been acquired, or do not share a common name with the component itself.
This means that the search is manual and a best effort approach.

If a CNA wishes to identify themselves for a particular component, they can use the contact information below.
The same applies in response to an advisory, if a CNA was not found in our search, they can contact us to be included in our list for future reference.

## Contact

Contact us at `jenkinsci-cert@googlegroups.com` if you have any questions about the Jenkins CNA.

IMPORTANT: Do not contact the Jenkins security team asking us for compliance documents, certifications, or to fill out a questionnaire.
We will not respond to such queries.
If we consider it necessary to provide a statement in response to incidents such as link:/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-rce-CVE-2021-44228/[log4shell] or link:/blog/2022/03/31/spring-rce-CVE-2022-22965/[SpringShell], you will find a response in our link:/blog/[blog].

## CVE Assignment Process

CVEs for privately reported and tracked security vulnerabilities are assigned shortly (several hours to a few days) before publication in a security advisory.
