The Jenkins project meets to discuss various topics on Gitter and IRC.
In addition to the general purpose rooms and channels listed below, link:../sigs/[special interest groups] and link:/projects[sub-projects] have their own spaces, and you will see chat rooms linked from their pages.

== Gitter

The Jenkins community discusses various topics in multiple rooms on https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/home[Gitter].
Various link:../sigs/[special interest groups] also use Gitter to meet, and you will find their rooms linked on the SIGs overview page.

=== https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/jenkins[jenkinsci/jenkins]

General discussions about Jenkins.

== Internet Relay Chat (IRC)

The Jenkins community discusses various project-related topics in multiple channels on the https://www.freenode.net[Freenode] IRC network.

For information on how to connect, see the https://freenode.net/[Freenode] website.

[NOTE]
====
Because of irregular spam attacks, we sometimes have to make some channels protected.
In such circumstances, we make the targetted channel(s) only accessible to registered IRC nicks.
Example error:
[source]
----
[10:28] -NickServ- my_nickname is not a registered nickname.
[10:28] == #jenkins Cannot join channel (+r) - you need to be identified with services
----
That means you basically need to create a reserved nick for you, link:https://freenode.net/kb/answer/registration[following the official documentation].
Once done, you will be able to connect to `#jenkins` even if that channel is undergoing a spam attack.
Note that even without this, this is a recommended practice so that people *know* this is you, and cannot be someone else, when a given nick is online.

=== `#jenkins`

This is the *primary channel* for discussions about Jenkins.
If you have questions about Jenkins, you'll probably want to ask them here.

https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=jenkins[Join using a web-based IRC client].

NOTE: if you have a question about Jenkins, just ask it -- don't ask whether you can ask a question.
It's common to not receive an answer for quite a while if no active contributors are currently checking IRC.
In that case, just stick around, and periodically (every few hours) ask your question again.

Conversations in this channel are automatically archived to https://echelog.com/?jenkins[echelog].

We use the *jenkins-admin* bot to automate common administrative operations.
Its use is limited to users with _voice_ or _op_ in this channel.
link:/projects/infrastructure/ircbot/[Learn more].

link:/project/board[Board members and officers] typically have _op_ (@) in this channel.
Established contributors typically have _voice_ (+) in this channel.

[[meeting]]
=== `#jenkins-meeting`

We conduct bi-weekly project meetings in this channel.
These meetings are open to everyone.
link:/project/governance/#meeting[Learn more about the project governance meeting].

Meetings are logged, and the channel is unused the rest of the time.
We use the *robobutler* to run these meetings.
See the link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Governance+Meeting+Agenda[about project meetings] for more details.

=== `#jenkins-community`

The channel to help organize events, documentation and more "meta conversations" around the Jenkins project.
We don't discuss Jenkins -- the software -- here. You can find conversation logs on https://botbot.me/freenode/jenkins-community/[botbot.me].

=== `#jenkins-infra`

Discussions of the link:/projects/infrastructure/[Jenkins project infrastructure], i.e. most services running on `jenkins.io`, `jenkins-ci.org`, and related domains.

=== Cloaks

#jenkins is not only a registered channel, but the Jenkins project has an official relationship with Freenode (see https://freenode.net/groupreg[the Freenode site] for more details).
Because of this, we can provide IRC cloaks for developers.
IRC cloaks are used to protect the privacy of developers.
Cloaking is also a common way for projects with an IRC presence to designate status for contributors and developers.
We currently offer the following cloak levels:

* `jenkins/developer/(username)`

To obtain a cloak:

* ensure you have a *registered user* on Freenode
* ensure you are already recognized as a developer (have +vV voice privilege)
* email jieryn@gmail.com with those details
* monitor your memoserv notices for updates from Freenode staff requesting confirmation of cloak request
** */msg memoserv help*
