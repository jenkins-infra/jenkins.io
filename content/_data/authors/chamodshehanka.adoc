I’m a software engineer specializing in full-stack development, microservices, and cloud-native technologies.

At Circles, I’m currently working on backend engineering for Telkomsel’s large-scale migration project (42M+ users). I transitioned a Kong API Gateway plugin into a standalone Go microservice, enabling offline API integrations across diverse protocols (JSON, XML, Form-Data, Octet Stream) with custom encryption/decryption mechanisms. The service is now in its final stages of optimization and production rollout at nationwide scale.

Previously, I built a CI/CD generation microservice for WSO2’s Choreo platform and developed open-source GitHub Action tools in Golang.

Beyond work, I’m active in the cloud-native community as a CNCF Ambassador and Google Developer Group Community Leader. I hold a GitHub Actions certification and am currently pursuing the CKA.

I’m passionate about solving real-world problems through Go, Node.js/React.js, and cloud-native technologies and outside of tech, you’ll find me practicing karate, lifting at the gym, or surfing.
