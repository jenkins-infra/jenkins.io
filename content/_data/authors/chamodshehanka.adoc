I'm a Software Engineer II working with Go, cloud-native systems, and observability at Circles.Life. I am active in CNCF communities and currently a CNCF and CD Ambassador, with a strong interest in observability, CI/CD, and platform engineering.

I have hands-on experience designing and integrating observability solutions using both vendor-specific tools like New Relic and open standards such as OpenTelemetry. My work includes distributed tracing, metrics, and CI pipeline visibility, with a focus on building scalable and maintainable instrumentation.

I am deeply involved in the Kubernetes ecosystem and community leadership. I co-lead Kubernetes Sri Lanka and KCD Sri Lanka. Through these roles, I actively mentor contributors, review technical work, and help grow open source communities.

I am exploring opportunities to contribute to Jenkins and Google Summer of Code by supporting OpenTelemetry-based observability initiatives, collaborating with maintainers, and helping guide contributors and students where appropriate.
