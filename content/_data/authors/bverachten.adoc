Bruno is a Developer Relation for the Jenkins project. He's been tinkering with continuous integration and continuous deployment for more than 8 years, with various products/tools/platforms (Gitlab CI, Circle CI, Travis CI, Shippable, Github Actions, Jenkins, ...), mostly for mobile and embedded development.
He's passionate about embedded platforms, the ARM ecosystem, and Edge Computing. His main goal is to add FOSS projects and platforms to the ARM architecture, so that it becomes as link:https://twitter.com/jonmasters/status/1523041597683683328[boring] as X86_64.
That's why you'll see lots of issue openings in his activity for projects that don't support yet the ARM architecture. He forked tons of existing repos to bring the code to the ARM platform, built some Docker link:https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6900395211625771008/?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A6900395211625771008%2C6901936098340155393%29[containers] that were downloaded several million times, and made very modest contributions to link:https://github.com/armbian/documentation/pull/104[some] FOSS repos.
He is also running the link:https://sbc-community.org/[SBC community] website which deals with the OrangePi SBCs.
