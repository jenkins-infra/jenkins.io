I started contributing regularly in 2019, with a focus on improving quality.
I'm also keeping up with some older plugins that are still really popular, like the Thin Backup Plugin and the Job Configuration History Plugin.
The community helped me to bring these back up to standard and I learned a lot along the way. Furthermore, I use these lessons to make regular improvements to the developer documentation.

In my day job, I'm a solution architect in a central team that provides Jenkins and DevOps consulting within a big automotive and industrial company.
