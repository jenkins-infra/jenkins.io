Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Maeve Ho, a GSoC 2025 contributor working with the Jenkins community to enhance the **Tekton Client Plugin**. My project focuses on delivering full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities for Tekton resources from within Jenkins â€” a step forward in unifying Jenkins pipelines with Kubernetes-native CI/CD automation.

== Project Focus

Tekton is a powerful framework for cloud-native CI/CD, but Jenkins users currently face limitations when managing Tekton resources â€” only basic creation and deletion are supported. My goal is to fill that gap by implementing full lifecycle operations, enabling Jenkins to interact deeply with:

* `Tasks` and `ClusterTasks`
* `Pipelines`
* `PipelineRuns` and `TaskRuns`
* `Triggers`, `TriggerBindings`, and `TriggerTemplates`

These enhancements will allow teams to visualize, modify, and automate Tekton workflows directly in Jenkins, helping reduce tool fragmentation and streamline Kubernetes CI/CD adoption.

== What I Did During the Bonding Period

The community bonding phase gave me a valuable opportunity to understand the ecosystem and set a strong technical foundation. I:

* Set up a local Jenkins + Minikube environment for full-stack plugin testing
* Explored the current plugin codebase and documented its architecture
* Reviewed Kubernetes client methods and Tekton CRD structures
* Collaborated with mentors (*@krisstern*, *@gounthar*, *@waveywaves*) to finalize feature scope and workflow design
* Drafted a comprehensive technical plan outlining the API extensions, validation logic, and Jenkins pipeline step design
* Opened https://github.com/jenkinsci/tekton-client-plugin/pull/390[#390] to upgrade the plugin to Java 17 and Jenkins 2.492.3, resolving Maven enforcer violations, removing legacy dependencies, and verifying runtime compatibility via `mvn hpi:run` and Jenkins UI.
* Ran successful builds and confirmed `.hpi` generation; currently triaging 9 failing tests and reviewing CI failures (SpotBugs, Javadoc, junit).


These early efforts ensure that the coding phase starts with clarity and purpose.

== Goals for the Coding Phase

Throughout the summer, my deliverables will include:

* Fully functional CRUD methods for Tekton resources with type-safe model classes
* Read and update logic using Kubernetes API conventions (`GET`, `PATCH`, etc.)
* Secure integration with Jenkins credentials for Kubernetes auth
* YAML/JSON parsing and serialization support for Tekton resource specs
* Jenkins pipeline steps (e.g. `tektonRead`, `tektonUpdate`) exposed via DSL
* Unit and integration tests against a local Kubernetes cluster
* Example pipelines and user documentation to guide adoption

These improvements aim to make Jenkins a more powerful tool in Kubernetes-native CI/CD environments, where teams often rely on both Jenkins and Tekton together.

== Looking Ahead

After GSoC, I plan to stay active in the Jenkins community â€” maintaining the Tekton Client Plugin, addressing user feedback, and possibly extending the plugin with user interface features like visual task/pipeline run inspectors. Iâ€™m also interested in mentoring future contributors and helping new students get started in open source, especially from underrepresented regions.

== About Me

Iâ€™m currently studying Computer Science at Lehigh University. My past experience includes:

* Deploying CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins and Kubernetes at VNPT
* Designing high-throughput data pipelines and HPC workflows using SLURM
* Developing REST APIs with strong error handling and credential isolation
* Building open-source projects involving AI, vector search, and caching systems

I enjoy projects at the intersection of infrastructure, cloud-native tooling, and developer experience â€” and this GSoC project is the perfect fit.

== Thanks & Acknowledgements

Huge thanks to my mentors â€“ *@krisstern*, *@gounthar*, and *@waveywaves* â€“ for their clear guidance, timely feedback, and thoughtful technical advice. I also appreciate the support from the Jenkins GSoC admin team and wider community for making this program welcoming and impactful.

== Progress Log

I maintain a public work log documenting technical notes, progress milestones, and debugging steps throughout the project here:
