Hi! Super happy you found me here. Iâ€™m Marky Jackson and I am a lover of family, friends and a die-hard San Francisco Giants fan. I left my heart in San Francisco in the summer of 2020 and now reside in San Diego, California.
I am a senior software engineer at Equinix Metal working on the Tinkerbell project.
I am a graduate student studying Data Science & Machine Learning under Michal Fabinger.
I was previously a Jenkins Goverence Board as well as the Jenkins Events Officer, a Kubernetes Org member, a Kubernetes Release Manager Associate, a Continuous Delivery Foundation Ambassador, a Jenkins core contributor, a Jenkins Google Summer of Code org admin and mentor, a Google Summer of Docs org admin and mentor, and helped with software development and community management on the Ortelius Project.
I have had profiles in the CNCF and other mediums. In the past I have spoken publicly and enjoyed writing blogs on technical topics. Previously, I was named the Most Valuable Jenkins Advocate.
Finally, I was previously a mentoring lead within the Kubernetes project as well as a previous Kubernetes Outreachy coordinator for the Kubernetes project.

You can find me on Twitter @markyjackson5
In January 2021, I decided to step back from open-source projects for the foreseeable future and focus on mental health, family, work and graduate school.
