I've started many years ago in the Java development before switching
progressively toward continuous delivery aspects.  I'm now a consultant
implementing CD solutions based on Jenkins. Implementation of the Pipeline
as Code principles have allowed one of my clients to be able to manage more
than 3000 jobs, using a self service approach based on the Seed plugin.

I'm also a contributor for some Jenkins plugins and the author of the
Ontrack application, which allows the monitoring of continuous delivery
pipelines.
