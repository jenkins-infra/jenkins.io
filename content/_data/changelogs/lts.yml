        Upgrade Remoting to version 3.1 with <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting/blob/master/docs/protocols.md#jnlp4-connect">JNLP4-connect protocol</a>.
        <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting/blob/master/docs/remoting-3-compatibility.md">Compatibility notes are available here</a>.
        Notably, it is no longer possible to use JDK 6 for the Maven project type, as communication with the Maven process uses Remoting, and it now requires Java 7.

    <strong>2.60.1 is the first Jenkins LTS release that requires Java 8 to run.</strong>
    If you're using the Maven Project type, please note that it needs to use a JDK capable of running Jenkins, i.e. JDK 8 or up.
    If you configure an older JDK in a Maven Project, Jenkins will attempt to find a newer JDK and use that automatically.
    If your SSH Build Agents fail to start and you have the plugin install the JRE to run them, make sure to update SSH Build Agents Plugin to at least version 1.17 (1.20 recommended).

    ##### Authorize project

        If you have the Authorize Project plugin installed and configured, its configuration will now be treated as final with respect to the behavior of <em>Job/Build</em> checks from <strong>Build other projects</strong> and <strong>Build after other projects are built</strong>.
        Formerly, if a <strong>Per-project configurable Build Authorization</strong> was enabled globally but some projects did not specify an <strong>Authorization</strong>, the two aforementioned checks would automatically fall back to checking as anonymous (typically denying build permission).
        To restore the former behavior, explicitly configure a <strong>Project default Build Authorization</strong> to be <strong>Run as anonymous</strong>.
        Note that this will affect all build-scoped permission checks, including for example <em>Agent/Build</em>.

      Adjust stream flushing behavior for code running remotely on agents for better performance.
      This may lead to loss of messages for plugins which print to a build log from the agent machine but do not flush their output.
      Use <code>-Dhudson.util.StreamTaskListener.AUTO_FLUSH=true</code> to restore the previous behavior for freestyle builds.
      Note that Pipeline builds always expect remote flush.

      Various improvements to the plugin manager, including:
      It no longer shows all available plugins by default; use search field to find plugins.
      They are now sorted by popularity by default.
      Additionally, categories are no longer used to group plugins, instead they're shown as labels.

  banner: >
    As described in the <a href="/blog/2020/11/10/major-changes-in-weekly-releases/">Major changes in the weekly release line</a> blog post, this release improves key user interface components.
    Configuration user interfaces now use html <code>div</code> markup to present a better layout than the previous html <code>table</code> layout.
    Configuration pages are now easier to read, easier to understand, and work better on a wide range of screens.
    See the <a href="https://issues.jenkins.io/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=20741">Jenkins issue tracker</a> for a list of plugins known to have issues with the change.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>As described in the <a href="/blog/2020/11/10/spring-xstream/">Spring and XStream updates (breaking changes!)</a> blog post, this release updates and replaces outdated internal components.
    The Acegi security library used for authentication has been replaced by Spring Security (<a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/227/README.adoc">JEP-227</a>).
    See the <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/227/compatibility.adoc">Spring Security compatibility table</a> for the latest plugin compatibility status.
    A fork of the XStream library used to read and write XML files has been replaced by the upstream version of XStream (<a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/228/README.adoc">JEP-228</a>).
    See the <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/228/compatibility.adoc">XStream compatibility table</a> for the latest plugin compatibility status.
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <b>Known Issues</b>If your Jenkins instance was created before Jenkins 2.4 or 2.7.1 LTS, a Setup Wizard may appear on the startup after the upgrade.
    In such a case, a Jenkins admin may need to skip the plugin installation.
    See the upgrade guide for the detailed guidelines.

    pr_title: "[JENKINS-75388] Remove `?path` and `?pattern` support from DBS"
    message: |-
      Remove support for <code>?path</code> and <code>?pattern</code> query parameters for directory listings of user content, such as workspaces, archived artifacts and others.
      The filter text box now uses JavaScript instead of a form submission to navigate to the expected URL.
      Programmatic users are advised to replace <code>?path</code> or <code>?pattern</code> in their requests with the resulting redirect URL, whose behavior did not change from before.
