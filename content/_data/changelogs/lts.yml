        Upgrade Remoting to version 3.1 with <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting/blob/master/docs/protocols.md#jnlp4-connect">JNLP4-connect protocol</a>.
        <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting/blob/master/docs/remoting-3-compatibility.md">Compatibility notes are available here</a>.
        Notably, it is no longer possible to use JDK 6 for the Maven project type, as communication with the Maven process uses Remoting, and it now requires Java 7.

    <strong>2.60.1 is the first Jenkins LTS release that requires Java 8 to run.</strong>
    If you're using the Maven Project type, please note that it needs to use a JDK capable of running Jenkins, i.e. JDK 8 or up.
    If you configure an older JDK in a Maven Project, Jenkins will attempt to find a newer JDK and use that automatically.
    If your SSH Slaves fail to start and you have the plugin install the JRE to run them, make sure to update SSH Slaves Plugin to at least version 1.17 (1.20 recommended).

    ##### Authorize project

      message: >
        If you have the Authorize Project plugin installed and configured, its configuration will now be treated as final with respect to the behavior of <em>Job/Build</em> checks from <strong>Build other projects</strong> and <strong>Build after other projects are built</strong>.
        Formerly, if a <strong>Per-project configurable Build Authorization</strong> was enabled globally but some projects did not specify an <strong>Authorization</strong>, the two aforementioned checks would automatically fall back to checking as anonymous (typically denying build permission).
        To restore the former behavior, explicitly configure a <strong>Project default Build Authorization</strong> to be <strong>Run as anonymous</strong>.
        Note that this will affect all build-scoped permission checks, including for example <em>Agent/Build</em>.

      Adjust stream flushing behavior for code running remotely on agents for better performance.
      This may lead to loss of messages for plugins which print to a build log from the agent machine but do not flush their output.
      Use <code>-Dhudson.util.StreamTaskListener.AUTO_FLUSH=true</code> to restore the previous behavior for freestyle builds.
      Note that Pipeline builds always expect remote flush.

      Various improvements to the plugin manager, including:
      It no longer shows all available plugins by default; use search field to find plugins.
      They are now sorted by popularity by default.
      Additionally, categories are no longer used to group plugins, instead they're shown as labels.
