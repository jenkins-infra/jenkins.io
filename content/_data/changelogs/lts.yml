        Upgrade Remoting to version 3.1 with <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting/blob/master/docs/protocols.md#jnlp4-connect">JNLP4-connect protocol</a>.
        <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting/blob/master/docs/remoting-3-compatibility.md">Compatibility notes are available here</a>.
        Notably, it is no longer possible to use JDK 6 for the Maven project type, as communication with the Maven process uses Remoting, and it now requires Java 7.
