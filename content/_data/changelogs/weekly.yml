          For compatibility, enforcement is skipped by default; you must install the Authorize Project plugin or similar for this to take effect.
  
          The “upstream pseudo trigger” was also removed in favor of a true trigger configured on the downstream project;
  
          you may use either the post-build action or the trigger according to where you want this configuration stored, and who is authorized to change it.

          Formerly, if a <strong>Per-project configurable Build Authorization</strong>

          To restore the former behavior, explicitly configure a <strong>Project default
          Build Authorization</strong> to be <strong>Run as anonymous</strong>.

      A bug introduced in Jenkins 2.96 will downgrade Script Security Plugin to version
      2.18.1, possibly resulting in cascading failures to load other plugins (and
      reintroducing security issues). We recommend updating Script Security Plugin
      to its newest release and immediately restarting Jenkins to resolve this issue.

          The deprecated Jenkins CLI Protocol versions 1 and 2, and Java Web Start

          If you still use these protocols (e.g. remoting-based CLI, or old <code>agent.jar</code>s
          on agents), you need to re-enable these protocols after upgrade, or upgrade
          the clients.

          Make sure detached plugins (plugins whose functionality used to be part of Jenkins itself) are installed upon Jenkins startup when needed as implied dependencies of other plugins which were already present.
          This simplifies compatibility for specialized installation scenarios not using the update center, such as when Jenkins is run from a Docker image prepackaged with some plugins.

      Globally configured build discarders are available for the first time with this
      release.
      Jenkins will now execute the configured per-project build discarder periodically
      <strong>even if no build is currently finishing</strong>.
      Globally configured build discarders may delete old builds if a project has
      been configured with a more aggressive build discarder configuration since the
      last build was run.

          Add a new experimental <code>Overall/SystemRead</code> permission, which gives (almost) full read access to the Jenkins instance.
          The permission is disabled by default, install the Extended Read Permission plugin to activate it.

          Deprecate the <code>Overall/RunScripts</code>, <code>Overall/UploadPlugins</code>, and <code>Overall/ConfigureUpdateCenter</code> permissions.
          Permissions were announced as dangerous and disabled by default in major authorization plugins in 2017.
          Custom authorization strategy implementations that grant <code>Overall/Administer</code> without implying one or more of these three permissions will no longer work as expected.
          Configurations that grant any of these permissions to users without <code>Overall/Administer</code> will no longer work as expected.

    banner: >
      This release replaces several key components.
      The Acegi security library used for authentication has been replaced by Spring
      Security (<a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/227/README.adoc">JEP-227</a>).
      A fork of the XStream library used to read and write XML files has been replaced
      by the upstream version of XStream (<a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/228/README.adoc">JEP-228</a>).
      Refer to the <a href="/blog/2020/11/10/spring-xstream/">Spring and XStream updates
      (breaking changes!)</a> blog post for more details.

          Stop bundling CVS plugin.
          Jenkins will no longer automatically install CVS plugin on startup if a plugin depending on Jenkins (then Hudson) 1.340 or earlier is discovered.
          If you use a plugin that relies on the functionality provided by CVS plugin and manage plugins outside the Jenkins plugin manager, you will now need to ensure yourself that a recent release of CVS plugin is installed.
          Jenkins will attempt to load such plugins but may fail at any time during startup or afterwards with <code>ClassNotFoundException</code> or similar.

          If you use such a plugin that also relies on the functionality provided by the Ant or Javadoc plugin (e.g., the RAD Builder and manage plugins outside the Jenkins plugin manager, you will now need to ensure that a recent release of the Ant or Javadoc plugin is installed.
          Jenkins will attempt to load such plugins but may fail at any time during startup or afterwards with <code>ClassNotFoundException</code> or similar.
