          If you have the Authorize Project plugin installed and configured, its configuration

          Formerly, if a <strong>Per-project configurable Build Authorization</strong>

          the two aforementioned checks would automatically fall back to checking

          To restore the former behavior, explicitly configure a <strong>Project default
          Build Authorization</strong> to be <strong>Run as anonymous</strong>.

    date: 2017-12-17
    banner: >
      A bug introduced in Jenkins 2.96 will downgrade Script Security Plugin to version
      2.18.1, possibly resulting in cascading failures to load other plugins (and
      reintroducing security issues). We recommend updating Script Security Plugin
      to its newest release and immediately restarting Jenkins to resolve this issue.

      Globally configured build discarders are available for the first time with this
      release.
      Jenkins will now execute the configured per-project build discarder periodically
      <strong>even if no build is currently finishing</strong>.
      Globally configured build discarders may delete old builds if a project has
      been configured with a more aggressive build discarder configuration since the
      last build was run.

          Developer: Plugins can now more easily add support for using build steps in pipelines with access to the appropriate environment variables (such as from tools/environment blocks or steps like withEnv).
          The <code>fingerprint</code> and <code>archiveArtifacts</code> pipeline steps will no longer apply any environment substitution.

    banner: >
      This release replaces several key components.
      The Acegi security library used for authentication has been replaced by Spring
      Security (<a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/227/README.adoc">JEP-227</a>).
      A fork of the XStream library used to read and write XML files has been replaced
      by the upstream version of XStream (<a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/228/README.adoc">JEP-228</a>).
      Refer to the <a href="/blog/2020/11/10/spring-xstream/">Spring and XStream updates
      (breaking changes!)</a> blog post for more details.

          Stop bundling CVS plugin.
          Jenkins will no longer automatically install CVS plugin on startup if a plugin depending on Jenkins (then Hudson) 1.340 or earlier is discovered.
          If you use a plugin that relies on the functionality provided by CVS plugin and manage plugins outside the Jenkins plugin manager, you will now need to ensure yourself that a recent release of CVS plugin is installed.
          Jenkins will attempt to load such plugins but may fail at any time during startup or afterwards with <code>ClassNotFoundException</code> or similar.

          If you use such a plugin that also relies on the functionality provided by the Ant or Javadoc plugin (e.g., the RAD Builder and manage plugins outside the Jenkins plugin manager, you will now need to ensure that a recent release of the Ant or Javadoc plugin is installed.
