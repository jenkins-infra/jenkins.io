        If you have the Authorize Project plugin installed and configured, its configuration will now be treated as final with respect to the behavior of <em>Job/Build</em> checks from <strong>Build other projects</strong> and <strong>Build after other projects are built</strong>.
        Formerly, if a <strong>Per-project configurable Build Authorization</strong> was enabled globally but some projects did not specify an <strong>Authorization</strong>, the two aforementioned checks would automatically fall back to checking as anonymous (typically denying build permission).
        To restore the former behavior, explicitly configure a <strong>Project default Build Authorization</strong> to be <strong>Run as anonymous</strong>.
