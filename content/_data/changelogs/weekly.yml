        If you have the Authorize Project plugin installed and configured, its configuration will now be treated as final with respect to the behavior of <em>Job/Build</em> checks from <strong>Build other projects</strong> and <strong>Build after other projects are built</strong>.
        Formerly, if a <strong>Per-project configurable Build Authorization</strong> was enabled globally but some projects did not specify an <strong>Authorization</strong>, the two aforementioned checks would automatically fall back to checking as anonymous (typically denying build permission).
        To restore the former behavior, explicitly configure a <strong>Project default Build Authorization</strong> to be <strong>Run as anonymous</strong>.

    Globally configured build discarders are available for the first time with this release.
    Jenkins will now execute the configured per-project build discarder periodically <strong>even if no build is currently finishing</strong>.
    Globally configured build discarders may delete old builds if a project has been configured with a more aggressive build discarder configuration since the last build was run.
