quote: Jenkins is one of the leading open source automation servers available.
  Jenkins has an extensible, plugin-based architecture, enabling developers to
  create 1,400+ plugins to adapt it to a multitude of build, test and deployment
  technology integrations. In 2017, Jenkins surpassed 155,000 active
  installations (these are active installations that report usage back to the
  Jenkins projectâ€”only a fraction of total installations), and approximately 1.5
  million users, making it the most widely deployed continuous delivery
  automation server in the world.
