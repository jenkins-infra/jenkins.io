Learn to create and run Declarative Pipelines with the Blue Ocean Editor, which is the easiest and safest way to define a build. You’ll learn the structure of Declarative Pipeline, how to control the flow of execution, how to save artifacts of the build, and get practice using some of the features that give fit and finish to your Pipeline. The course consists of lectures with follow-along labs plus lab exercises that allow you to practice what you have learned.
