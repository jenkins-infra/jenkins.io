Tomasz SÄ™k from VirtusLab will present Jenkins Operator for Kubernetes.
This presentation will explain how operator pattern helps to manage Jenkins in Kubernetes.
We will take a look at the operator pattern and its use cases.
A closer look at the Jenkins Operator will show the operator pattern in practice.
Then we will go through day-to-day operations automation that the operator provides like deployment, configuration and repair of a Jenkins instance.
