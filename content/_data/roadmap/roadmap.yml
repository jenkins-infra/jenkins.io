        The “slave” term was deprecated and replaced by “agent” in Jenkins 2.0.
        In July 2020 we also adopted the “controller” term instead of “master”, and deprecated the “whitelist/blacklist” terms.
        There are many places where the old terminology still needs to be replaced.
        We want to replace the deprecated terminology by new terms: “controller”, “agent”, “allowlist”, “denylist”, and “main” for branch names.
