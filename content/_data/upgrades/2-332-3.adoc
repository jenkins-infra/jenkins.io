==== Log messages discarded under memory pressure

As of 2.332.1, log messages are discarded when the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is under memory pressure.
As of 2.332.3, such discarded messages appear in the Log Recorder page as `<discarded>`.
To retain such log messages, alleviate memory pressure by increasing the Java heap size with e.g. the `-Xmx` Java flag.
Alternatively, install https://plugins.jenkins.io/support-core/[Support Core] to write these log messages to disk,
where they are not subject to eviction.
