==== Jenkins sign-in page update

The Jenkins sign-in page was updated with enhanced visuals and support for browser-native themes.
Unfortunately, this has created an issue with the plugin:login-theme[Login Theme] plugin. 
A fix has been developed and merged in the 2.414.2 LTS release.
After updating your Jenkins LTS version, users of this plugin will need to update to the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/login-theme-plugin/releases/tag/46.v36f624efb_23d[latest version].
