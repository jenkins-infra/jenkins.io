Starting from this release, we won't support .NET Framework 2.0 for launching the Jenkins controller or agents as Windows services.
Microsoft.NET Framework 4.0 or above is now required for using the default service management features.

This release also upgrades link:https://github.com/winsw/winsw[Windows Service Wrapper (WinSW)] from 2.3.0 to 2.9.0 and replaces the bundled binary from .NET Framework 2.0 to 4.0.
There are many improvements and fixes in these versions,
big thanks to link:https://github.com/NextTurn[NextTurn] and all other contributors.
You can find the full WinSW changelog link:https://github.com/winsw/winsw/releases[here],
just a few highlights important to Jenkins users:

* Prompt for permission elevation when administrative access is required.
  Now Jenkins users do not need to run the agent process as Administrator to install the agent as a service from GUI.
* Enable TLS 1.1/1.2 in .NET Framework 4.0 packages on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.
* Enable strong cryptography when running .NET Framework 4.0 binaries on .NET 4.6.
* Support security descriptor string in the Windows service definition.
* Support 'If-Modified-Since' and proxy settings for automatic downloads.
* Fix Runaway Process Killer extension so that it does not kill wrong processes with the same PID on startup.
* Fix the default domain name in the `serviceaccount` parameter (jira:JENKINS-12660[])
* Fix archiving of old logs in the `roll-by-size-time` mode.

As you may see, there are many improvements available with this version,
and we hope that it will make Windows service installation even more reliable.
Some of the changes in WinSW also replaced old workarounds in the Jenkins core,
making the code more maintainable.

===== Use-cases affected by .NET Framework 2.0 support removal

If you use .NET Framework 2.0 to run the Jenkins Windows services,
the following use-cases are likely to be affected:

* Installing the Jenkins controller as a Windows service from Web UI.
  The official MSI Installer supports .NET Framework 2.0 for the moment, but it will be changed in future versions.
* Installing agents as Windows services from GUI.
  This feature is provided by in link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/windows-slave-installer-module[Windows Agent Installer Module] from the Jenkins core.
* Installing agents over Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) via the plugin:windows-slaves[WMI Windows Agents] plugin
* Auto-updating of Windows service wrappers on agents installed from GUI.

===== Upgrade guidelines

If all of your Jenkins controller and agent instances already use .NET Framework 4.0 or above,
there are no special upgrade steps required.
Please enjoy the new features!

If you run the Jenkins controller as a Windows Service with .NET Framework 2.0,
this instance will require an upgrade of .NET Framework to version 4.0 or above.
We recommend running with .NET Framework 4.6.1 or above,
because this .NET version provides many platform features by default
(e.g. TLS 1.2 encryption and strong cryptography),
and Windows Service Wrapper does not have to apply custom workarounds.

If you want to continue running some of your agents with .NET Framework 2.0,
the following extra upgrade steps are required:

1. Disable auto-upgrade of Windows Service Wrapper on agents by setting the
  `-Dorg.jenkinsci.modules.windows_slave_installer.disableAutoUpdate=true` flag on the Jenkins controller side.
2. Upgrade agents with .NET Framework 4.0+ by downloading the recent Windows Service Wrapper 2.x
  version from link:https://github.com/winsw/winsw/releases[WinSW GitHub Releases]
  and manually replacing the wrapper ".exe" files in the agent workspaces.
