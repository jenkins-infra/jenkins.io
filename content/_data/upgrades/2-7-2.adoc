==== Support for HTTP_PROXY environment variable in remoting component

https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-32326[JENKINS-32326]

Support for HTTP proxy exclusion in the build agent launcher was added. Build agents that define this variable, but whose connection to the Jenkins master relies on it not being enabled may now fail to to connect to Jenkins. The solution is to fix the proxy configuration as passed to the agent process.
