==== Jakarta Plugin Updates

Users that have the plugin:jakarta-mail-api[Jakarta Mail API] and plugin:jakarta-activation-api[Jakarta Activation API] plugins installed in their Jenkins instance must update both plugins to the latest version in lockstep.
If the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jakarta-mail-api-plugin/releases/tag/jakarta-mail-api-2.1.3-1[Jakarta Mail] and link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jakarta-activation-api-plugin/releases/tag/jakarta-activation-api-2.1.3-1[Activation] API plugins are not updated subsequently this will cause a breaking change.
As with any update or upgrade we advise link:/doc/book/system-administration/backing-up/[backing up] your instance and upgrading all plugins before and after you update Jenkins.

NOTE: These updates are not specific to the 2.440.2 release, but are crucial for any users of these plugins.
