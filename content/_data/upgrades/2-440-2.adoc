NOTE: These upgrade are not specific to the 2.440.2 release, but are crucial for Jenkins users.

==== OpenJDK Upgrade

Due to a recent change in the upstream OpenJDK, users may encounter a breaking change if they do not upgrade and restart their Java processes.
When upgrading the Java runtime to OpenJDK 11.0.22 and later or 17.0.10 and later, you **must** restart the Java process.
This practice applies to both controllers and agents: when upgrading the Java runtime on the controller, restart the Java process on the controller; when upgrading the Java runtime on the agent, restart the Java process on the agent.

Details of the issue are available in link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-72665[JENKINS-72665].

==== Jakarta Plugin Upgrades

Users that have the plugin:jakarta-mail-api[Jakarta Mail API] and plugin:jakarta-activation-api[Jakarta Activation API] plugins installed in their Jenkins instance must update both plugins to the latest version in lockstep.
If the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jakarta-mail-api-plugin/releases/tag/jakarta-mail-api-2.1.3-1[Jakarta Mail] and link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jakarta-activation-api-plugin/releases/tag/jakarta-activation-api-2.1.3-1[Activation] API plugins are not updated subsequently this will cause a breaking change.
As with any update or upgrade we advise link:/doc/book/system-administration/backing-up/[backing up] your instance and upgrading all plugins before and after you update Jenkins.
