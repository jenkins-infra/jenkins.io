==== XStream2 unable to round-trip ASCII NUL

Jenkins has switched from using `KXm12Driver` to `StandardStaxDriver`.
Due to this change, Jenkins XML files can no longer save text content with the ASCII NUL character (U+0000).
In particular, if you are using the plugin:junit[JUnit plugin] to publish test results, be sure to update it to link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/junit/releases/[the latest version] to avoid problems with new builds.
Test results published with older versions of the plugin will remain unreadable.

NOTE: If you experience this issue with any other plugins, raise a bug report within the plugin repository.
