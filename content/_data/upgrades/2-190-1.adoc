==== Jenkins no longer creates symbolic links inside project or build directories

https://issue-redirect.jenkins.io/issue/37862[JENKINS-37862]

There were a lot of bugs and limitations with use of symbolic links for build directories, especially on platforms like Windows.
Additionally, this functionality was not widely used.

Starting from Jenkins LTS 2.190.1 Jenkins no longer creates symbolic links inside project or build directories.
The link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/build-symlink[Build Symlink] plugin may be installed to restore this functionality if desired.
URLs such as `/job/…/lastStableBuild/` are not affected, only tools which directly access the `$JENKINS_HOME` filesystem.
