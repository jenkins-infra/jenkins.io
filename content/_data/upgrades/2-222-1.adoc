NOTE: 2.222.1 and 2.204.6 were released on the same day, and both contain the same security fixes.
This upgrade guide only covers the upgrade from 2.204.6.
See link:../2.204/[its upgrade guide] for information related to upgrading from 2.204.5, including all information related to security fixes common to both releases.

==== Global build discarder configuration lost on restart

The global build discarder configuration is saved when the administrator modifies it, but is not loaded when Jenkins restarts.
The default global build discarder configuration is used when Jenkins restarts.

On every restart, Jenkins 2.222.1 will start with the default build discarder configured.
That means:

* Any custom global build discarder configuration is lost on restart
* Users who don't want background build discarders get the default one

==== Old builds may be deleted by global build discarders

Jenkins will by default periodically run build discarders configured in projects, even when no builds are currently running.
**This may delete old builds of projects that have been configured with a more aggressive build discarder configuration since the last build was run.**

We recommend reviewing project configurations for aggressive build discarder settings before upgrading Jenkins if this change in behavior could result in unexpected data loss.

NOTE: We recommend creating backups of your Jenkins configuration and data regularly.



==== Always enabled CSRF Protection

Jenkins will automatically enable CSRF protection with the default crumb issuer if it was disabled before.
The ability to not have CSRF protection enabled has been deprecated and removed from the UI.

API clients should authenticate using API tokens, which doesn't require CSRF crumbs since 2.96.

Set the system property `hudson.security.csrf.GlobalCrumbIssuerConfiguration.DISABLE_CSRF_PROTECTION` to `true` on startup to disable CSRF protection as well as the configuration UI for it.
This is an unsupported option and may be removed in the future.

While Jenkins is running, the configuration UI can be locked/unlocked by running one of the following commands in the script console:

----
// to allow disabling
hudson.security.csrf.GlobalCrumbIssuerConfiguration.DISABLE_CSRF_PROTECTION = true

// to force enabled
hudson.security.csrf.GlobalCrumbIssuerConfiguration.DISABLE_CSRF_PROTECTION = false
----

This will not immediately change the configured crumb issuer; the _Configure Global Security_ form must be submitted once to change the setting accordingly.



==== Removed agent protocols

_Inbound TCP Agent Protocol_ versions 1, 2, and 3 (also known as _JNLP Protocols_ or _Java Web Start Protocols_) have been removed.
These protocols have been deprecated link:/blog/2017/08/11/remoting-update/[since Jenkins 2.75 in 2017].

plugin:ssh-slaves[SSH Build Agents Plugin] uses the latest `agent.jar`, but other agent types may need to have their `agent.jar` updated manually.
//The following agent types should be updated:
//
//TODO Oleg to rewrite
//TODO Oleg to rewrite



==== Redesigned password form field

To reduce the number of times that browser password auto-fill will inappropriately fill in saved credentials, the password form fields used in Jenkins configuration forms have been redesigned.
In case this change causes problems, it can be reverted by setting the system property `hudson.Functions.hidingPasswordFields` to `true`.



==== Dangerous permissions deprecation

link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jep/blob/master/jep/223/README.adoc[JEP-223], link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-60266[JENKINS-60266]

In 2017 the `Overall/RunScripts`, `Overall/UploadPlugins`, and `Overall/ConfigureUpdateCenter` were announced as potentially dangerous permissions and hidden from view in plugin:matrix-auth[Matrix Authorization Plugin] and plugin:role-strategy[Role-based Strategy Plugin] to prevent accidental misconfigurations (link:/security/advisory/2017-04-10/#matrix-authorization-strategy-plugin-allowed-configuring-dangerous-permissions[2017-04-10 security advisory]).

These permissions are now deprecated and no longer used in Jenkins core.
Configurations which grant any of these permissions while not granting `Overall/Administer` will no longer work as before, as Jenkins now requires `Overall/Administer` permission for features previously governed by these permissions.
Custom authorization strategies that grant `Overall/Administer` without implying one or more of those permissions will no longer work as expected as a result.
Plugins are also expected to switch from requiring these deprecated permissions to requiring `Overall/Administer` instead, resulting in further unexpected behavior changes in these configurations.


==== Remove network discovery services 

https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-33596[JENKINS-33596], https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-60913[JENKINS-60913]

Network discovery features, DNS multicast and UDP broadcast, were previously disabled and discouraged because of various problems, including link:/security/advisory/2020-01-29/#SECURITY-1641[SECURITY-1641 in Jenkins Security Advisory 2020-01-29].
They have now been removed without replacement.

plugin:swarm[Swarm Plugin] needs to be updated to version 3.18 or above, otherwise the error described in https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-61029[JENKINS-61029] occurs. This also removes the network discovery capability of the plugin.



==== Header and Breadcrumb Layout Improvements

link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/4463[PR-4463], link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-60920[JENKINS-60920]

Instances with plugins that depend on specific details of the Jenkins UI (like plugin:simple-theme-plugin[Simple Theme plugin]) may experience issues with this release and may need to be updated.
In the case of the Simple Theme plugin, theme maintainers may need to adapt the theme to the UI changes.



==== Removal of jenkins-slave.xml resource file

link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/pull/4330[PR-4330]

The resource file `jenkins-slave.xml` has been removed as it's been unused in Jenkins core since 2017.
plugin:windows-slaves[WMI Windows Agents Plugin] needs to be updated to version 1.3.1 or newer (released in March 2017).
