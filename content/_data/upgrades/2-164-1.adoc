==== Changes related to Java 11 compatibility

// TODO jaxb Plugin explanation for Java 8



Some plugins use JAXB libraries provided by the JDK. However, the `java.xml.bind` and `javax.activation` modules are no longer included in OpenJDK 11, and plugins might fail if no replacement is offered.

To fix this problem, weâ€™ve bundled those libraries into a new detached plugin: plugin:jaxb[JAXB plugin].
When Jenkins 2.164 or newer is running on Java 11, this plugin is automatically installed.
However, if you manage your plugins outside Jenkins (for example, if you use `plugins.txt` in your Docker images), you might need to explicitly install the plugin.

Many further changes related to Java 11 have been implemented since 2.150.3.
