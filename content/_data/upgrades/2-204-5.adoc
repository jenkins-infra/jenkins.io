==== Custom System Logging Formats Ignored

Custom system logging formats are ignored in Jenkins 2.204.5 as a result of link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-57888[JENKINS-57888].
Fixes for the high default maximum form size limit and reverse proxy redirection are included in Jenkins 2.204.5, and they required downgrade of the Jetty dependency.

There is no workaround available for this issue in the 2.204.5 release.
We plan to fix it in the next LTS release (2.222.1).
