==== Expansion of the serialization blacklist

https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/SECURITY/Jenkins+Security+Advisory+2016-11-16[Security Advisory 2016-11-16]

The major part of the security fix is an expansion of the serialization blacklist used for remoting (Jenkins CLI and master/agent communication) and XStream (XML configuration and data files).

It is possible that legitimate uses of classes in blacklisted packages will no longer work. This will be indicated by any of the following in exception messages in logs:

----
Rejected: com.sun.jndi.rmi.EvilClass
Refusing to unmarshal com.sun.jndi.rmi.EvilClass for security reasons
Refusing to marshal com.sun.jndi.rmi.EvilClass for security reasons
----

In these examples, `com.sun.jndi.rmi.EvilClass` is a placeholder for a real class name.

It is possible to customize the blacklist used by setting the `hudson.remoting.ClassFilter.DEFAULTS_OVERRIDE_LOCATION` System property for the Jenkins controller `java` invocation. It is expected to be set to the path to a file containing a complete, custom blacklist overriding the default one.

The default blacklist is defined in link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting/blob/remoting-3.2/src/main/java/hudson/remoting/ClassFilter.java#L57...L79[`ClassFilter.java` in the remoting component]. In a configuration file as used for `hudson.remoting.ClassFilter.DEFAULTS_OVERRIDE_LOCATION`, the default blacklist would look like this:

----
^bsh[.].*
^com[.]google[.]inject[.].*
^com[.]mchange[.]v2[.]c3p0[.].*
^com[.]sun[.]jndi[.].*
^com[.]sun[.]corba[.].*
^com[.]sun[.]javafx[.].*
^com[.]sun[.]org[.]apache[.]regex[.]internal[.].*
^java[.]awt[.].*
^java[.]rmi[.].*
^javax[.]management[.].*
^javax[.]naming[.].*
^javax[.]script[.].*
^javax[.]swing[.].*
^org[.]apache[.]commons[.]beanutils[.].*
^org[.]apache[.]commons[.]collections[.]functors[.].*
^org[.]apache[.]myfaces[.].*
^org[.]apache[.]wicket[.].*
.*org[.]apache[.]xalan.*
^org[.]codehaus[.]groovy[.]runtime[.].*
^org[.]hibernate[.].*
^org[.]python[.].*
^org[.]springframework[.](?!(\p{Alnum}+[.])*\p{Alnum}*Exception$).*
^sun[.]rmi[.].*
----

To check whether any given class name is blacklisted, run the following command in _Manage Jenkins » Script Console_, replacing `com.sun.jndi.rmi.EvilClass` with the class name you want to check:

----
hudson.remoting.ClassFilter.DEFAULT.isBlacklisted('com.sun.jndi.rmi.EvilClass')
----

Removing or relaxing entries on this blacklist must be done carefully as to not open yourself up to known exploits. A possible alternative could be to disable the CLI via HTTP and JNLP agent port (see below) to prevent its unauthenticated use.

==== Disabling the CLI

Another change in Jenkins 2.19.3 is the new feature to disable the CLI over HTTP and JNLP by setting the System property `jenkins.CLI.disabled` to `true`. This is a more convenient alternative to run the https://github.com/jenkinsci-cert/SECURITY-218/[Groovy script provided as a workaround to SECURITY-218 and SECURITY-360] for users who do not want to allow unauthenticated access to the Jenkins CLI even with the security fix.

While the CLI can be used using the Jenkins integrated SSH daemon as well, this requires authentication, so it's not a vector for unauthenticated attacks. To disable this feature as well, disable the SSH server port in _Manage Jenkins » Configure Jenkins » SSH Server_.
