[#SECURITY-2558]
==== Triggering Builds in Scripted Clients Without a Security Realm

Jenkins used to allow triggering builds using HTTP GET requests when no security realm and authorization strategy are defined.
This is newly prohibited since Jenkins 2.319.2 and 2.330 as this could be abused via CSRF even when Jenkins is operated on a private network.

HTTP POST requests to Jenkins need to provide a CSRF token (crumb) unless they authenticate using a user-specific API token.
When Jenkins is configured without security realm, there is no way to authenticate using an API token, so any scripted clients triggering builds first need to obtain a CSRF crumb from the crumb issuer as described link:/doc/book/security/csrf-protection/#working-with-scripted-clients[in the documentation].
