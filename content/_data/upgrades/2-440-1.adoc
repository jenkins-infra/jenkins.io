==== Upgrade to the latest version of Remoting

The `-jnlpUrl ${JENKINS_URL}/computer/${AGENT_NAME}/jenkins-agent.jnlp` argument to the agent JAR has been deprecated; use `-url ${JENKINS_URL}` and `-name ${AGENT_NAME}` instead, potentially also passing in `-webSocket`, `-tunnel`, and/or work directory options as needed.
Make sure you reset all inbound launcher options to defaults, and follow new guidance for command-line options for agent.jar.
The official Docker images are already using the new calling convention.
