Multiple changes related to the agent-to-controller security subsystem may result in problems.

[#SECURITY-2458]
==== Agent-to-controller security hardening (role checks)

Jenkins agents communicate with the controller using the https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting/[remoting library].
Individual messages (implementations of the `Callable` interface) instruct the other side to perform operations and/or provide information.
To restrict what agents can instruct controllers to do, `Callable` implementations are expected to implement a _role check_, i.e. a declaration on which side of the communication channel they can be executed.

To prevent plugins from (unintentionally) not implementing an effective role check, Jenkins will reject `Callables` with unimplemented role checks starting with 2.319 and LTS 2.303.3.
See link:/doc/book/security/controller-isolation/required-role-check/[the Required Role Check page for more details, including a list of known affected plugins and workarounds].

The link:/doc/developer/security/remoting-callables/[developer documentation] contains guidelines for the safe and correct implementation of the `Callable` interface.


[#SECURITY-2455]
==== Agent-to-controller file path filter security fixes

link:/security/advisory/2021-11-04/#SECURITY-2455[SECURITY-2455]

Jenkins agents communicate with the controller using the https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting/[remoting library].
For compatibility with existing plugins, agents are allowed some limited access to files on the Jenkins controller file system.
Jenkins 2.303.3 and 2.319 fix multiple vulnerabilities that resulted in incomplete access control enforcement.

Any plugins that access files on the Jenkins controller from code running on agents may be affected by these security fixes.
Beyond previously allowed operations now being prohibited, the newly introduced path canonicalization means that instances using a custom builds directory (link:/doc/book/managing/system-properties/#jenkins-model-jenkins-buildsdir[Java system property `jenkins.model.Jenkins.buildsDir`]) or partitioning `JENKINS_HOME` using symbolic links may fail access control checks to files that are intended to be accessible.

If access to a file is rejected, an exception with the following message is made available to agents; this is typically what also will show up in build logs and similar output:

----
Agent may not access a file path. See the system log for more details about the error ID ↵
    '<UUID here>' and https://www.jenkins.io/redirect/security-144 for more information
----

The link:/doc/book/system-administration/viewing-logs/[Jenkins system log] will contain more details.

As of 2021-11-04, no plugins are known to be affected by this security fix.

In case of problems, you can temporarily link:/doc/book/security/controller-isolation/agent-to-controller/#file-access-rules[customize the file access rules] to allow specific, intended agent-to-controller file path accesses to pass.
Applying custom rules is also the recommended workaround when using a custom builds directory or using symbolic links to distribute `JENKINS_HOME` across multiple volumes.

// TODO Reference JENKINS issue once filed
[NOTE]
====
Due to a bug in current releases of Jenkins discovered only shortly before release of Jenkins 2.319 and 2.303.3 (https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-67061[JENKINS-67061]), Jenkins will only consider the additional rules defined through the UI from the time that the form is submitted until Jenkins is restarted.
To work around this bug and load both bundled and custom rules, run the following script in the link:/doc/book/managing/script-console/[script console] after submitting rules through the UI:

[source,groovy]
----
ExtensionList.lookupSingleton(
    jenkins.security.s2m.AdminWhitelistRule.class).filePathRules.load()
----

====

// This is where we would keep track of affected plugins and their fixes.

NOTE: If you are unable to immediately upgrade Jenkins, you can install the link:/redirect/remoting-security-workaround/[Remoting Security Workaround Plugin].
It will prevent all agent-to-controller file access using `FilePath` APIs.
Because it is more restrictive than the Jenkins security fixes, more plugins are incompatible with it.
Make sure to read the plugin documentation before installing it.


[#SECURITY-2428]
==== Agent-to-controller security fix related to build directory access

Jenkins agents communicate with the controller using the https://github.com/jenkinsci/remoting/[remoting library].
For compatibility with existing plugins, agents are allowed some limited access to files on the Jenkins controller file system.
The directories agents are allowed to access include the directories storing build-related information, intended to allow agents to store build-related metadata during build execution.
As a consequence, this allowed _any_ agent to read and write the contents of _any_ build directory on the Jenkins controller file system with very few restrictions (`build.xml` and some Pipeline-related metadata).

Since Jenkins 2.319 and LTS 2.303.3, agents are only allowed to access contents of build directories related to builds currently running on the agent attempting to access the directory.

Plugins that implement functionality executing on agents that accesses build directories on the Jenkins controller file system may be impacted by this change.
Plugins accessing directories of builds not currently running on the agent accessing the directory will need to be adapted to no longer do that.
Jenkins will not associate Pipeline `node` blocks with the agents they're running on unless https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-durable-task-step/[Pipeline: Nodes and Processes] has been updated to version 2.40 or newer.

If access to a file by an agent is rejected, an exception with the following message is thrown instead; this is typically what also will show up in build logs and similar output:

----
Agent tried to access build directory of a build not currently running on this system. ↵
    Learn more: https://www.jenkins.io/redirect/security-144/
----

The link:/doc/book/system-administration/viewing-logs/[Jenkins system log] will contain more detailed information.

Additionally, plugins opening a direct channel between the controller and a process, like https://plugins.jenkins.io/maven-plugin/[Maven Integration Plugin], are completely prohibited from accessing build directories.

If access to a file by a process is rejected, an exception with the following message is thrown instead; this is typically what also will show up in build logs and similar output:

----
Failed to discover context of access to build directory
----

The link:/doc/book/system-administration/viewing-logs/[Jenkins system log] will contain more detailed information.

As of 2021-11-08, no plugins are known to be affected by this security fix.

This security fix can be disabled by setting the Java system property link:/doc/book/managing/system-properties/#jenkins-security-s2m-runningbuildfilepathfilter-skip[`jenkins.security.s2m.RunningBuildFilePathFilter.SKIP`] to `true`.

NOTE: If you are unable to immediately upgrade Jenkins, you can install the link:/redirect/remoting-security-workaround/[Remoting Security Workaround Plugin].
It will prevent all agent-to-controller file access using `FilePath` APIs.
