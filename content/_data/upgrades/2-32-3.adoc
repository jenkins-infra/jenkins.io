==== Removal of `X-You-Are-In-Group` headers on "Permission denied" pages

https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-39402[JENKINS-39402]

"Permission denied" pages will no longer include HTTP headers listing all the groups the current user is a member of, as a large number of headers could in some cases result in reverse proxies errors.

Access URLs such as `/whoAmI` to get information about the currently logged in user and group memberships.

To restore the previous behavior, set the system property `hudson.security.AccessDeniedException2.REPORT_GROUP_HEADERS` to `true`. This is not generally recommended.
