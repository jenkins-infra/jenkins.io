[#SECURITY-2371]
===== Session fixation security fix

Jenkins 2.300 and LTS 2.289.2 contain link:/security/advisory/2021-06-30/#SECURITY-2371[a security fix] for a session fixation vulnerability.
Due to how the Jenkins API and extension points are structured, it is possible that this fix is not compatible with your chosen security realm.

In case of problems authenticating after applying this update, we recommend setting the link:/doc/book/managing/system-properties/#hudson-security-securityrealm-sessionfixationprotectionmode[Java system property `hudson.security.SecurityRealm.sessionFixationProtectionMode`] to `2`.
This will apply an alternative (and possibly more compatible) implementation of the security fix.
It is also possible to disable the fix entirely by setting that system property to `0`.
This should only be done as a temporary measure and only when understanding the impact of the security issue in your environment.
