==== PNG and GIF icons replaced with SVG icons

Scalable vector graphics images are used in Jenkins instead of the GIF and PNG images that were used previously.
SVG images provide a better user experience and improve the Jenkins user experience.

The GIF and PNG images have been removed from Jenkins core.

Ensure all your plugins are the most recent release before updating core, otherwise images may be missing.
Check for new plugin versions immediately after the core update and install available updates.

==== Java Native Runtime library removed

The Java Native Runtime (JNR) library has been removed from Jenkins core.
Users of https://plugins.jenkins.io/pam-auth/[PAM Authentication] must upgrade to at least version 1.7.
Users of https://plugins.jenkins.io/file-leak-detector/[CloudBees File Leak Detector] must upgrade to at least version 1.7.

Users of https://plugins.jenkins.io/maven-repo-cleaner/[Maven Repository Scheduled Cleanup] do not have a compatible upgrade.
They should remove the plugin.

==== Self-signed certificate not provided automatically

In previous versions of Jenkins, a self-signed certificate was used if no HTTPS keystore was specified when processing HTTPS inside the Jenkins java process.
This feature has been removed.

If HTTPS or HTTP/2 is being processed directly by the Jenkins java process, an HTTPS keystore must be configured by adding the `--httpsKeyStore=path/to/keystore` and `--httpsKeyStorePassword=keystorePassword` arguments.
This change does not affect HTTPS processing that is performed in link:/doc/book/system-administration/reverse-proxy-configuration-with-jenkins/[reverse proxies] like Nginx and Apache HTTP Server.

See link:/doc/book/installing/initial-settings/#https-with-an-existing-certificate[HTTPS with an existing certificate] and link:/doc/book/installing/initial-settings/#https-certificates-with-windows[HTTPS certificates with Windows] for more information on creating a key store.

==== Reject connections from unsupported agent versions

Jenkins now rejects connections from agents with unsupported Remoting versions.
When an agent with a Remoting version older than 3.14 connects to the Jenkins controller, the agent connection is rejected.
The agent status page will show the message:

[source]
----
This agent is offline because Jenkins failed to launch the agent process on it.
----

Agents with unsupported Remoting versions can be allowed to connect to the controller by setting the `hudson.slaves.SlaveComputer.allowUnsupportedRemotingVersions` system property to true.

Administrators that want more information about agent versions can install the link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/versioncolumn/[Version Node Monitors] plugin.
It displays the remoting version of the connected agent in the "Nodes" page and can be configured to require matching Remoting versions, matching Java versions, and more.
