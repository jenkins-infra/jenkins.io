==== Docker script `install-plugins.sh` removed

The `install-plugins.sh` script in the Docker image of the controller has been deprecated for over 18 months.
It has been replaced in the Docker image with a script that directs the user to use the plugin installation manager tool.
The plugin installation manager tool is available in the image as `jenkins-plugin-cli`.

The plugin installation manager tool provides more information about the plugins they are downloading, such as available updates and security warnings.
The plugin installation manager tool handles Jenkins version requirements and dependency management better than the `install-plugins.sh` script did.

See the https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool/#readme[plugin installation manager documentation] for more details.
