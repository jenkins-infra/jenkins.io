==== Adding an escape hatch for authenticated users

Access to the Resource URL for authenticated users was previously removed in link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-72636[JENKINS-72636].
However, with the release of 2.462.3, this functionality has been restored.
To allow an authenticated user to access the Resource URL, add the system property `jenkins.security.ResourceDomainRootAction.allowAuthenticatedUser=true` on startup.
This can also be done live by executing the groovy script `jenkins.security.ResourceDomainRootAction.ALLOW_AUTHENTICATED_USER = true`.
