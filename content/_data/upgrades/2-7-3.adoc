==== Enforced upgrade of detached plugins

https://issue-redirect.jenkins.io/issue/37041[JENKINS-37041]

Jenkins will now ensure that detached plugins, i.e. those whose functionality used to be part of Jenkins core but was moved into a plugin, are always at least the bundled version. A message will be printed to the log informing administrators of this:

 Upgraded detached plugins (and dependencies)
