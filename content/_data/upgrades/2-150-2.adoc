==== Possible authentication problems

link:/security/advisory/2019-01-16/#SECURITY-901[SECURITY-901]

The security fixes in 2.150.2 require that security realms call `SecurityListener#authenticated` or `SecurityListener#loggedIn` after successful authentication.
If a security realm does not do either, sessions will be invalidated immediately, and users logged out again.

To disable this security fix when using a security realm that does not call `SecurityListener`, set the link:/doc/book/managing/system-properties/[Java system property] `jenkins.security.seed.UserSeedProperty.disableUserSeed` to `true`.

Affected plugins and their status is tracked https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Plugins+affected+by+the+SECURITY-901+fix[on the Jenkins wiki].
