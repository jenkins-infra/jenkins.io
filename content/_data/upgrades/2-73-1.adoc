==== Known Issue: Agent connection failures involving Jenkins controllers with undefined or non-writable home directory

link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-45755[JENKINS-45755]

A regression involving agent connections has been identified.
If the user home directory (`HOME`, not `JENKINS_HOME`) on the Jenkins controller is undefined, or not writable, no remoting connections can be established.

The following features are known to impacted:

. Agent connections
. Remoting-based CLI connections (deprecated since 2.46.2)
. Building Maven projects (Maven Integration Plugin)

The error shown will include the path to a directory `.jenkins/cache/jars` inside the home directory, and its stack trace will reference `hudson.remoting.FileSystemJarCache`.

The Jenkins Docker image has been changed to have a defined, writable home directory for the Jenkins user.
Typical web application container (e.g. Tomcat) setups may not have a writable home directory for the user the container is running as, and may need to be adapted to work around this issue.

Possible workarounds:

. Make the specified home directory writable to the Jenkins user.
. Define a home directory that is writable for the user Jenkins is running as.
. Override it for the process running Jenkins, for example using the `-Duser.home=/path/to/directory` parameter to the `java` command, pointing to a writable directory.


==== Known Issue: Randomly occurring connection failures with passphrase-protected ed25519 SSH keys

link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-46754[JENKINS-46754]

A regression involving authentication using passphrase-protected ed25519 SSH keys has been identified in 2.73.
It randomly causes failures in features using these keys, such as:

. SSH Slaves Plugin connections
. Accessing Git repositories with the JGit implementation
. Accessing Subversion repositories (unconfirmed)

Workarounds for this issue:

. Do not use ed25519 for SSH keys in Jenkins
. Do not protect ed25519 SSH keys in Jenkins with a passphrase
. In the case of Git Plugin, switch to the Git CLI implementation

==== Groovy 2.4.11 Upgrade

link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-43197[JENKINS-43197]

Groovy was updated from 2.4.8 to 2.4.11.
This may resolve existing Groovy-related memory problems, as 2.4.9 contains the fix for link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GROOVY-8067[GROOVY-8067].
It may no longer be necessary to apply the `groovy.use.classvalue` workaround.


==== Winstone 4.1 Upgrade

link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-43713[JENKINS-43713],
link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-46968[JENKINS-46968]

The embedded Jetty container has been updated from version 9.2.15 to version 9.4.5.
For a detailed list of changes, see link:https://github.com/eclipse/jetty.project/blob/master/VERSION.txt[the Jetty changelog].

In this update, support for the optional `--spdy` parameter has been dropped.
Jenkins will now refuse to start if the `---spdy` parameter is specified.
It needs to be removed from any Jenkins init scripts.

Additionally, support for all TLS versions before 1.2 has been dropped.
If you're using the embedded Jetty container's HTTPS functionality, it will no longer accept TLS 1.0 or 1.1 connections.


==== Build Authorization

link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-22949[JENKINS-22949],
link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-30574[JENKINS-30574]

This change affects only users of Authorize Project Plugin.

Previous releases of Jenkins implemented a special permission fallback when Authorize Project Plugin did not specify a global default configuration:
For the purposes of *Build other projects* and *Build after other projects are built*, if Authorize Project configuration did not specify a build authorization for the job in question, it fell back to acting with the permissions of the _anonymous_ user.
This ensured a secure default, but only for these trigger-related permission checks.

This behavior has been changed, and Jenkins will now perform the permission check as SYSTEM (i.e. with full permissions) to determine whether a project should be built.

To restore the previous behavior, configure a global *Project default Build Authorization* setting the default authorization to that of the anonymous user.
This feature has been implemented in Authorize Project Plugin version 1.2.0.

==== Remoting Work Directories

link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-44108[JENKINS-44108],
link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-44112[JENKINS-44112]

The embedded link:/projects/remoting/[Jenkins Remoting] version has been updated from 3.7 to 3.10.
It introduces support of work directories, which may be used by Remoting to store caches, logs and other metadata.

Once work directory mode is enabled, Jenkins agents start writing logs to the disk and change the default destination of the filesystem JAR Cache.
In Remoting this opt-in feature can be enabled using the `+-workDir=${ROOT_DIR}+` command-line option, but the Jenkins defines custom behavior for some agent launchers:

* Java Web Start Launcher (aka _JNLP agent_)
** Old agents: Work directory needs to be enabled manually
** New agents created from Web UI: Work directory is enabled by default, work directory points to _Remote root directory_ of the agent.
** New agents created from CLI/API: Behavior depends on the passed configuration file, work directory is disabled by default
* Command Launcher
** No changes, work directory should be manually enabled in launch settings if required
* Other Launcher types (e.g. SSH Launcher)
** The behavior is defined in plugins, which have independent release cycle
** Follow updates in tickets linked to link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-44108[JENKINS-44108]
