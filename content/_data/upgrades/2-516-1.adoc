==== Jenkins header redesign

With the release of 2.516.1, the Jenkins header has been redesigned for a more modern look and feel.

The updated header now includes the *Manage Jenkins* link, which was previously located in the left navigation pane, as well as dropdown menus for additional actions and user management options.
Plugins such as plugin:support-core[Support Core] and plugin:design-library[Design Library] will now be added to the *More Actions* menu, providing a centralized location for plugin-specific actions.

The top navigation bar has also been updated as part of the header redesign, which now features direct links to various actions and areas of the pipeline, branch, job, and more.

==== Utilize Spring Security for Jenkins' own user database passwords

Unless operating in link:https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/system-administration/FIPS-140/[FIPS-140 mode], Jenkins' own user database no longer supports creating passwords longer than 72 bytes (UTF-8), which is the maximum length supported by the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt[bcrypt password hashing function] it uses.
This length corresponds to 72 basic ASCII characters, 24 - 36 CJK characters, or 18 emoji.

Existing passwords longer than 72 bytes can still be used to log in.

Users with longer passwords are advised to change their password to be at most 72 bytes, while choosing from a larger character set to achieve the same complexity.

==== Remove RunIdMigrator

No action is required when upgrading from a version prior to 2.516.1.
On the first startup after upgrading, you will see an info log: `hudson.model.Job#onLoad: Deleting legacyIds file in /.../JENKINS_HOME/jobs/my-job/builds. See [JENKINS-75465](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-75465) for more information.`.

However, if you decide to downgrade after upgrading, you may want to manually create the `legacyIds` file in the builds directory to prevent a potential slow startup.
This is because the older version will perform migration checks when the file is missing.
For reference, refer to link:https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-ci-kb/latest/client-and-managed-controllers/jenkins-startup-logs-show-runidmigrator-logs#_workaround[this CloudBees KB workaround bash script].

==== Views tab now configurable per user

As of Jenkins 2.516.1, the configuration as code entry for `myViewsTabBar` is deprecated.
Users can now select one of the implementations of `ViewsTabBar` to be used for the *My Views* dashboard.

==== Value Attribution added to button element in `submit.jelly`

To help with handling form submissions, a value attribute to the button element in `submit.jelly`.
Plugin developers may need to update how they handle POST requests if they rely on an empty string as the value of the submit button.
They will need to update it to be the displayed value of the button instead.
