==== Configuration as code entry for 'myViewsTabBar' is deprecated.

As of 2.528.1, the configuration as code entry for 'myViewsTabBar' has been deprecated.
In its place, a new user property has been introduced that makes it possible for a user to override what is configured for the global dashboard or a folder.
This will be seen as the Views Tab Bar in Jenkins UI.
Instead of the 'myViewsTabBar', users can now select one of the implementations of 'ViewsTabBar' to be used for the My Views dashboard.
The default view on the *My Views* configuration is a selectable option instead of checking if the user enters a valid view name.
