The Jenkins Operator is a link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/[*Kubernetes Native Operator*] which manages operations for Jenkins on Kubernetes. It has been built with Immutability and declarative Configuration as Code in mind.

== Project Vision

With Jenkins Operator project we want to enable community to run Jenkins in cloud-native environments like Kubernetes. Also, support most of the public cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) in terms of additional capabilities like backups, observability and cloud security.

With declarative configuration and full lifecycle management based on the link:https://operatorframework.io/[Operator Framework] this can become the de facto standard for running Jenkins on top of Kubernetes.

=== Notable Features

* Full lifecycle-management of Jenkins using link:https://sdk.operatorframework.io/[*Operator SDK*]
* Integration with Kubernetes plugin:kubernetes-plugin[*Jenkins plugin for Kubernetes*]
* Pipelines as Code link:https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/[*Jenkins pipelines*]
* Extensibility via link:/doc/book/managing/groovy-hook-scripts/[*Groovy Init Hook Scripts*] or plugin:configuration-as-code[*Configuration as Code plugin*]
* Secure Defaults and Hardening link:https://jenkinsci.github.io/kubernetes-operator/docs/security/[*see the security section of the documentation*]

=== Getting started

* link:https://jenkinsci.github.io/kubernetes-operator[*Documentation and getting started*] guide
* Questions about the **use** of Jenkins Operator should be asked on `##jenkins-operator` link:https://virtuslab-oss.slack.com/[*virtuslab-oss.slack.com*] slack channel
* The link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-operator[source code]
* Feature requests, bugs and so on are currently tracked via the GitHub link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-operator/issues[issue tracker]
