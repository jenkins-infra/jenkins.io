Development tools for Jenkins configuration as code (JCasC) are
incomplete and not as helpful as they could be.  IDE autocompletion
does not work as expected in the leading IDE's (IntelliJ, Visual
Studio Code, and Atom).

This project will improve Jenkins configuration as code development
tools through a CommunityBridge project.  It is the first
CommunityBridge project in the Jenkins community.  It will be used as
an experiment with CommunityBridge and as a project to improve
development tools for Jenkins configuration as code.

=== Issues

* Missing schema definitions
* Schema validation issues
* No automated schema validation tests

=== Solutions

* [NEW] Fix existing JSON schema issues
* [NEW] Rewrite schema in Java if JSON fixes are infeasible

=== Phase 1: Fix the JSON Schema Generator

  * Validate generated schema with a few plugins installed (see link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin/issues/760[issue 760])
  * Validate generated schema with link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/blob/stable-2.176/core/src/main/resources/jenkins/install/platform-plugins.json[Jenkins 2.176.2 suggested plugins] installed

=== Phase 2: IDE Autocompletion For JCasC

  * IntelliJ IDE autocompletion with error detection for the yaml files
  * Visual Studio Code autocompletion with error detection for the yaml files
  * Atom autocompletion with error detection for the yaml files
