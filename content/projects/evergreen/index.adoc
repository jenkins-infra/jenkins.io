Evergreen is an automatically updating rolling distribution system for
Jenkins. It consists of server-side, and client-side components to
support a Chrome-like upgrade experience for Jenkins users.

Jenkins Evergreen provides the end-user with a
pre-assembled collection of legos that can be immediately used to implement CI
footnoteref:[ci, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration]
and CD
footnoteref:[cd, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery] workloads.
At the same time, this focus on end-users success in these well-defined scenarios
will help the Jenkins project develop new features, and fix
bugs, more rapidly than before.

== Getting Started

[CAUTION]
====
Evergreen is currently in **beta** and is **not** recommended for production
just yet. Early adopters are welcome!
====

=== On Docker

The easiest way to get started with Jenkins Evergreen is to use the Docker
image which is _auto-configured_ to run Docker Pipelines. When
`jenkins/evergreen:docker-cloud` is launched, it will automatically download
the latest version of Jenkins and the most essential plugins and automatically
configure basic authentication, Docker settings, and Jenkins Pipeline.

In the example below, Jenkins Evergreen will be made available on port `8080`
and persist its data in `$PWD/jenkins-home`, allowing the container to be
restarted if necessary.

.Starting Jenkins Evergreen
[source,bash]
----
docker volume create jenkins-evergreen-data && \
docker pull jenkins/evergreen:docker-cloud && \
docker run --name evergreen \
    --restart=always \
    -ti \
    -p 8080:80 \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -v jenkins-evergreen-data:/evergreen/data \
    -e LOG_LEVEL=info \
    jenkins/evergreen:docker-cloud
----

Once `docker run` executes, navigating to
link:http://localhost:8080/[localhost:8080]
will load Jenkins once Evergreen has fetched the latest updates.

==== Built-in status and documentation

Evergreen comes with its own built-in status dashboard and documentation, which
can be found at
link:http://localhost:8080/evergreen/[localhost:8080/evergreen/]
and
link:http://localhost:8080/evergreen/docs/[localhost:8080/evergreen/docs/]
respectively.

The status dashboard will automatically update as Evergreen fetches and performs updates, and should be referred to should any issues arise.

==== Fetching the administrator password

Once Jenkins Evergreen is up and running, you will need to fetch the
dynamically generated administrator password in order to log in.

[source,bash]
----
docker exec evergreen cat /evergreen/data/jenkins/home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
----


=== On AWS

[TIP]
====
The AWS-based installation is coming soon!
====


== How it works

The model applied with the Evergreen distribution system is one similar to
"deploying" Software-as-a-Service, without having a centralized "production"
environment. When documentation refers to a "Deployment", that entails a new
"Upgrade" of Jenkins Evergreen being made available in the Evergreen hosted
service layer, and the backend orchestration necessary to ping connected
Instances to initiate their local upgrade process.

A Deployment is then considered successful when all connected Jenkins
Evergreen Instances are running that new version of Jenkins Evergreen.


== Contributing

Jenkins Evergreen builds off of the existing core and plugin ecosystem, so
link:/participate[participating] in
the current Jenkins development process also benefits Evergreen!

Evergreen consists of a backend API service and a client, code for both can be
found in the
link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/evergreen[jenkins-infra/evergreen]
repository on GitHub.

=== Reporting Issues

Jenkins Evergreen issues can be reported in the Jenkins project's
link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org[Jira].
Issues should be reported for the "JENKINS" Project, and use the "evergreen"
Component.

A list of the outstanding issues can be found in our

=== The Four Opens

Inspired by the OpenStack project
footnote:[https://governance.openstack.org/tc/reference/opens.html]
_Jenkins Evergreen_ follows "The Four Opens":

==== Open Source

We do _not_ produce “open core” software.

We are committed to creating truly open source software that is usable and
scalable. Truly open source software is not feature or performance limited and
is not crippled.

We use the MIT license.

==== Open Design

*We are committed to an open design process.*  The development cycle requires
active collaboration to gather requirements and write specifications for
upcoming releases. Those events, which are *open to anyone,* include users,
developers, and upstream projects. We gather requirements, define priorities
and flesh out technical design to guide development for the next development
cycle.

The community controls the design process. You can help make this software meet
your needs.

==== Open Development

We maintain a publicly available source code repository through the entire
development process. We do public code reviews. We have public roadmaps. This
makes participation simpler, allows users to follow the development process and
participate in QA at an early stage.

==== Open Community

One of our core goals is to maintain a healthy, vibrant developer and user
community. Most decisions are made using a lazy consensus model. All processes
are documented, open and transparent.
