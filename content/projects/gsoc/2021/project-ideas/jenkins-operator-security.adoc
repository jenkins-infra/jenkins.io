=== Project Details

The link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-operator[Jenkins Operator] is a Kubernetes Native Operator which manages operations for Jenkins on Kubernetes.
It enables  community to run Jenkins in cloud-native environments like Kubernetes, OpenShift and others. Also, supports most of the public cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) in terms of additional capabilities like backups, observability and cloud security.

* Visit the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-operator[project page]
* Follow link:https://jenkinsci.github.io/kubernetes-operator/docs/developer-guide/[developer guide] and run Jenkins Operator locally

If you are interested in exploring Kubernetes and software-defined operators ecosystem more in-depth, as well as enhance your Go coding skill - this is definitely an interesting opportunity to consider.

=== Problem Statement

Some of the plugins have security warnings which are not properly presented to the end users. This may result in introducing security risk in existing CI/CD infrastructure.

As part of reconciliation process of Jenkins, when plugins are already downloaded but not yet installed add a validation step that will check if chosen plugins contain security issues, using link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/[Kubernetes Admission Controller].
It can be implemented by taking an advantage of built-in security check mechanism in Jenkins Update Centre - the operator should fetch the data directly from Jenkins Download Center (over REST API) about security warnings for corresponding list of plugins to be installed.

Additionally, in case a security warning is detected, user should be able to choose if Jenkins Operator should continue with installation process.
