=== Background

As the CI/CD world is moving more towards automation and minimal human interaction, the ability to full automate a release, including the determination of the "next" release version becomes desirable.

Semantic/Conventional commits is one way of programatically understanding the changes made between releases 

For a existing project released at `1.0.0`, the following commit messages would bump the version as follows:

|===
|Commit Message|Next Version 

|`chore: improve logging`
|`1.0.1`
|`fix: minor bug fix`
|`1.0.1`
|`feat: add a new feature`
|`1.1.0`
|`BREAKING CHANGE: reimplement`
|`2.0.0`
|===

==== Project Details

This project idea proposes to implement a Jenkins plugin which will allow the `nextVersion` to be determined from the commit log.

The project requires the student to start with plugin development from scratch and then work with understanding how to integrate this plugin into a Jenkins pipeline.

In the beginning, the student can work on understanding the Jenkins plugin development by writing code for creating a simple Build Step which determines the current version from the latest tag.

This can be extended in the future to support other methods of determining the version e.g. `Chart.yaml` / `pom.xml` / `build.gradle` or `package.json`
