=== Background
In 2019 there was a Jenkins Google Summer of Code project to create a tool to automatically install plugins from the command line based on a provided input.
This is meant to help with creating reproducible environments and other places where you would want to install a certain set of plugins.
The project was successful in creating a useable tool to install plugins with a 1.0 release.
Over time, the plugin installation manager was improved and added to other components like official Jenkins Docker images.

As a part of this project,
students are invited to introduce new features and improvements in the plugin installation manager.
The list of enhancements is a subject for discovery as a part of the application process
Some of the ideas are available in the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool/issues[project tracker].

=== Quick Start
Visit the project page at https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool

1. Clone the project
2. Run the tests; there are several different lists of plugins
3. Run the Plugin Installation Manager for various combinations of plugins with a real Jenkins instance.
   See how the downloads and caching work.
4. Try out some edge cases to see what could be improved.

=== Skills to Study and Improve
* Java
* YAML/data structures/package management tools
* Writing command line interfaces
* How the Jenkins Docker image and Configuration as Code (CasC) work

=== Newbie Friendly Issues
