=== Abstract

As Jenkins continues to evolve, users often seek efficient ways to navigate its extensive documentation, plugins, and community discussions. This project proposes the development of an AI-powered chatbot integrated into the Jenkins interface, enabling users to retrieve information swiftly through natural language queries.

=== Rationale

Navigating Jenkins documentation can be daunting, especially for newcomers. A contextual AI assistant embedded in Jenkins can significantly reduce friction by offering quick answers and plugin-related insights. This project aims to create a dedicated chatbot that understands user questions and provides accurate, fast responses using NLP and ML models. A previous community discussion and growing interest validate the need for such a plugin.

=== Implementation

The project will involve:

- **Chatbot Plugin:** Build a Jenkins plugin that embeds the AI chatbot.
- **NLP Integration:** Utilize NLP frameworks such as spaCy, NLTK, or LlamaIndex to process natural language queries.
- **Data Sources:** Integrate official documentation, plugin data, and community resources for relevant answers.
- **UI/UX:** Design a clean chat interface within the Jenkins UI.
- **Performance:** Optimize inference time and resource usage.

Potential tools and technologies:
- Python + LLM integrations
- TypeScript/JavaScript for UI
- Jenkins Plugin Development Framework
