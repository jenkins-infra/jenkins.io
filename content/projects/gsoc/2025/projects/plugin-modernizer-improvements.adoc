=== Abstract

This GSoC project idea is a continuation of the link:/projects/gsoc/2024/projects/using-openrewrite-recipes-for-plugin-modernization-or-automation-plugin-build-metadata-updates[GSoC 2024 Using OpenRewrite Recipes for Plugin Modernization] project.
The current link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/plugin-modernizer-tool[Plugin Modernizer] will need to be enhanced to support more modernization recipes and provide integrations with the Jenkins ecosystem.


=== Rationale

The Jenkins ecosystem combines a monolithic core with a modular plugin system.
True, this design provides a great degree of flexibility and robustness, yet also it poses challenges to propagating large-scale changes throughout the ecosystem.
The lack of automation has led to many plugins falling behind with regard to ecosystem-wide migrations.
This project proposes the creation of a new tool to apply generic transformations across the Jenkins ecosystem.

=== Implementation

Improvements and integration could include:

- Store metadata about the modernization process on link:https://reports.jenkins.io[Jenkins reports site]
- Provide APIs to access the modernization metadata in addition to the existing CLI module (or even run the modernization recipes as a service)
- Generate metadata regularly (using Jenkins infrastructure or GitHub Actions depending on the research done during the project)
- Better integration with the Plugin Health Score to automatically run modernization recipes on plugins with low scores
- Visualize the modernization metadata on link:https://stats.jenkins.io[Jenkins statistics site]
- Any recipe improvements or new recipes that could be added to the tool to improve plugins health
