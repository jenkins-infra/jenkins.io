=== Abstract
This full-stack project focuses on a proof-of-concept (PoC) idea to fine-tune an existing open-source LLM model (to be determined) with domain-specific Jenkins data to be compiled, wrangled, and processed by the contributor as a part of an AI-driven application, to develop a minimalistic UI for the user to interact with the LLM as a complete end-to-end product. Our focus will be on offering some much-needed visualizations, search functionality, and LLM-driven infrastructure assistance tools using the ci.jenkins.io data.


=== Rationale
The main source of raw data will be the publicly available ci.jenkins.io datasets. It is hoped that by providing some LLM-driven visualizations and search functionality, Infra team users will be able to better understand the Jenkins usage data and gain insights into how Jenkins is being used in real-world scenarios. The LLM-driven infrastructure assistance tools will help users understand and troubleshoot issues related to Jenkins infrastructure, such as configuration issues, build failures, test failures, and other common problems.


=== Implementation
The project will involve the following key steps:

* **Data Collection**: Collect and analyze the ci.jenkins.io data to identify patterns and trends in Jenkins usage.
* **Data Wrangling**: Process the collected data to prepare it for fine-tuning the LLM model.
* **LLM Fine-tuning**: Fine-tune an existing open-source LLM model (such as Llama 2) with the processed Jenkins data to create a domain-specific model.
* **Dashboard Development**: Develop a dashboard using React.js to visualize the Jenkins usage data and provide insights into Jenkins usage patterns.
* **LLM Integration**: Integrate the fine-tuned LLM model into the dashboard to provide users with AI-driven assistance for infrastructure-related tasks.
* **Search Functionality**: Implement a search feature that allows users to query the LLM for specific Jenkins-related information.
* **UI/UX Design**: Design a clean and intuitive user interface for the web application to enhance user experience.
