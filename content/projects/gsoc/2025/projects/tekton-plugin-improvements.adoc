=== Abstract

This project enhances the Jenkins Tekton Client Plugin by implementing full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for Tekton resources. Currently, the plugin supports only Create and Delete functionality, which limits users’ ability to fully manage and automate Kubernetes-native CI/CD pipelines through Jenkins. This GSoC project will deliver comprehensive lifecycle management of Tekton Tasks, Pipelines, PipelineRuns, Triggers, and more—directly within Jenkins—streamlining DevOps workflows across hybrid environments.

=== Rationale

Tekton is a modern, Kubernetes-native framework for building CI/CD systems. While Jenkins remains a leading automation server, its integration with Tekton has been limited by the existing plugin’s inability to support Read and Update operations. These gaps force users to switch between Jenkins and `kubectl` or Tekton dashboards, which breaks the development flow and impedes automation.

By delivering full CRUD capabilities, this project empowers Jenkins users to:
- Automate Tekton workflows without leaving the Jenkins interface.
- Reduce manual context switching and improve productivity.
- Build more advanced and dynamic CI/CD pipelines.
- Enable future enhancements like dashboard visualization, pipeline DSLs, and advanced validations.

=== Implementation

This project will be executed in four technical phases:

*Phase 1: API Client Extension*
- Add Create, Read, Update, and Delete support for Tekton CRDs via Kubernetes Java client.
- Handle error responses, retries, and authorization using Jenkins credentials plugin.
- Implement modular and testable methods for Tekton objects like `GetTask()`, `UpdatePipelineRun()`.

*Phase 2: Resource Management Framework*
- Create model classes for Tekton resource types (e.g., Tasks, Pipelines, Triggers).
- Add YAML/JSON serialization and validation logic.
- Enable type-safe object manipulation and conversions between Tekton and Kubernetes schemas.

*Phase 3: Jenkins Integration*
- Provide new Jenkins pipeline steps for Tekton CRUD operations.
- Securely integrate with the Jenkins credentials store for Kubernetes tokens.
- Add optional UI components for resource status/log viewing.

*Phase 4: Testing & Documentation*
- Unit tests for all new operations.
- Integration tests using a Kubernetes environment (e.g., Minikube).
- Complete documentation, usage examples, and developer guides.

=== Benefits to Jenkins

- **Tight Kubernetes-native Integration**: Extend Jenkins into cloud-native CI/CD environments.
- **Full Lifecycle Management**: From triggering a Task to viewing a PipelineRun’s logs—all in Jenkins.
- **Improved Developer Experience**: No more context switching between tools.
- **Advanced Automation**: Enables conditional logic, retries, and dynamic pipeline behavior.
- **Secure + Scalable**: Built-in support for credential management, token scoping, and multi-namespace handling.
