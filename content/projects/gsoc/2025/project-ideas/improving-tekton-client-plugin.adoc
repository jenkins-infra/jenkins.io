=== Background

The link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/tekton-client/[Tekton Client Plugin] enables Jenkins to interact with Tekton, a powerful and flexible cloud-native CI/CD framework. This project aims to enhance the plugin's capabilities, improve its integration with the Jenkins ecosystem, and provide a better user experience for cloud-native CI/CD workflows.

Key areas for improvement include:

- Support any version of Tekton Pipeline by dynamically loading the appropriate Tekton client version
- Support for other Tekton resources such as Tekton Chains, Triggers, and EventListener

Stretch goals:

- Convert existing Jenkins Pipeline steps to use the Tekton Client Plugin (translating the DSL to the Tekton Pipeline YAML)
