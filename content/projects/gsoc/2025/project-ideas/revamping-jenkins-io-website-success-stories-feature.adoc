=== Background

The current jenkins.io "Success Stories" feature at link:https://stories.jenkins.io/[] is in need of a revamp to keep it looking sharp and relevant.
The project at link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/stories/[] is in need of modernization tech-stack wise, as we will need to upgrade the React version used to the latest possible (ideally v19) as well as upgrade the versions of most of the dependencies used.
Besides, we will need to redesign the layout of its UI/UX including but not limited to the landing page, the story page, the map, etc.

Moreover, the workflow for users to submit new stories may need to be redesigned and reimplemented, given the context of the Infra Helpdesk issue at link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/4392/[].
