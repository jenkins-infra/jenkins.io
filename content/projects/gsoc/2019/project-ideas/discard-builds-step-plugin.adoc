The idea behind this plugin is to give users more options to manage and implement a data retention policy that covers their build histories, artifacts
and workspaces (internal and external).
This responsibility typically falls on the shoulders of Jenkins administrators,
but since projects can have unique data retention requirements, this responsibility should be with project contributors.
This plugin would enable users to specify their own data retention policy via a Pipeline build step.

The current Discard Old Builds feature could be improved, however to use it one must resort to clicking buttons in the UI, which is not
desirable in the context of configuration-as-code. Also, the plugin would offer features above and beyond the existing Discard Old Builds functionality.

The plugin would internally work in two phases:

* Determine a list of builds to discard by looking at the build history of a given project.
* Perform the discard actions on the builds that were made elements of the list of builds to discard.

This plugin would leverage and enhance the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/run-selector-plugin/blob/master/README.md[Run Selector Plugin] for selecting builds to discard, and new code would be written to perform the data discard actions.

More information regarding this proposal is available link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q2p_XZEdbkcVDMpEPTtjPS15i2Oq3CQgH_geJjPhofY/edit#heading=h.h6ynt8ul8vwx[here].
