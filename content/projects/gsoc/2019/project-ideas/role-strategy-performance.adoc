link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Role+Strategy+Plugin[Role Strategy Plugin] is widely used in Jenkins as an authorization engine,
but it has known performance limitations for large-scale setups.
In this project the proposal is to improve the plugin's performance and to create a proper testing framework for Jenkins security plugins.

The project may include:

* Perform profiling of the plugin, together with the mentor
* Optimize memory and CPU usage by updating internal
  (refactor string operations, redesign APIs, etc.)
* Introduce better caching logic for role groups and assignments
* Setup test automation in order to verify the plugin's performance
  in Jenkins pull request builds
