link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Role+Strategy+Plugin[Role Strategy Plugin] is widely used in Jenkins as an authorization engine,
but it has a pretty legacy Web UI which could be significantly improved.
The plugin's existing APIs are also very limited, and they could be redesigned.

Ideas:

* Redesign the WebUI using a new technology stack, e.g. React
* Introduce new REST APIs to improve manageability of the plugin
* Introduce new logic to query permissions from Jenkins instances,
  probably as a part of the plugin:security-inspector[Security Inspector Plugin]
