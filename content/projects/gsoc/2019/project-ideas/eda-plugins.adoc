The idea is to create a Jenkins plugin for one of widely used EDA tools.
Both ASIC or FPGA design flow are acceptable, the tool should be proposed by the potential student.
Open-source EDA tools would be preferable (e.g. Yosys, FuseSoC, ArachnePnR, icetools), but we also consider
conditionally-free tools (like FPGA design EDAs).

Examples of tool integration:

* Tool launch and publishing steps for Free-style and/or Pipeline jobs
* Integration with Warnings Plugin for report parsing.
* Reporting of FPGA resource utilization (per build + trends)
* Timing report trend publishing
* Integrating UVM reports into Jenkins build and project pages

**Special requirements:**
In the case of FPGA tools integration, a prototyping board will be required.
