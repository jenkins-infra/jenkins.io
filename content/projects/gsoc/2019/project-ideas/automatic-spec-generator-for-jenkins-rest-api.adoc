Developers need to know what to expect in terms of responses for each REST API endpoint, so external tools like link:https://github.com/cdancy/jenkins-rest[jenkins-rest] can be developed with confidence. The two main contents users of the REST API are looking for are:

* HTTP responses and codes
* Body of message and its format (e.g. JSON, html, etc.)

Jenkins does not have automated REST API documentation at all at this time. A lot of APIs are contributed from extensions, so there are multiple REST APIs (core and plugins). The goal of this project is to find and implement the extraction of the REST APIs from the sources and generate and publish the REST APIs respective documentation.

Focus first on generating the specification, then later look at the versioning. Nested objects make versioning challenging.

Q: how to generate the expected answers
A: extract answers from javadoc, annotations?, etc.

Regarding versioning of the REST API, the jenkins core REST API and the plugins own REST API need to be versioned separately. For the jenkins core, this could be done with a URL like: 

http://localhost/rest/api/1.0, http://localhost/plugin/rest/api/1.0, and the plugins would have their own REST API path with a version number. Plugins and the core would thus have their own version number, and an additional REST API version number.

Documentation generation should also be part of the automatic generation by swagger.
