We wish to add Cloud features to the Jenkins External Workspace Manager Plugin.
The current design documentation is : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XqUoG8QuyxwVzEAa9tN4PMUwhApBlZ1IIKW8WLOjUFI/edit?usp=sharing
This would allow Jenkins workspaces to be cloud based or located remotely, rather than being local.
These features include:

* Cloud-based storage support (link:https://groups.google.com/d/msg/jenkinsci-dev/z40kn8IqFb8/YkdgbuScCgAJ[discussion])
* Support use of multiple discard strategies
* Integration with the core's “Discard old builds” feature
* Improvements to data retention policies (e.g.
jira:JENKINS-48715[],
jira:JENKINS-2111[],
jira:JENKINS-38764[])
* Workspace usage statistics
* Improvements to workspace usage statistics
* Better workspace cleanup management, e.g. matrix workspaces cleanup link:https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-27329[JENKINS-27329]
