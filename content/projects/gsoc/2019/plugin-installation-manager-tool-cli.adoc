There are currently many reincarnations of plugin management across Jenkins, including:

  * link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker#preinstalling-plugins[Docker images install-plugins.sh script]
  * link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/custom-war-packager[Custom WAR Packager]
  * link:https://jenkins.io/projects/evergreen/[Jenkins Evergreen]
  * link:https://github.com/ndeloof/jenkinsfile-runner-go[A Jenkinsfile Runner implementation]
  * link:https://github.com/coreos/jenkins-os/blob/master/init.groovy[coreOS groovy script]

This project will create a new Plugin Manager CLI tools and a library which would unify the plugin management across different Jenkins implementations.  The first step will be extracting plugin management from Jenkins Core into its own module.
