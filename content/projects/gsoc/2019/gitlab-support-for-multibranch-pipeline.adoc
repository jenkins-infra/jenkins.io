Currently GitLab Plugin does not support Multibranch Pipeline jobs. The underlying API does
not implement calls to fetch Merge Requests during builds. Other problems with this plugin is
doesn't follow conventional SCM plugin design, doesn't support folder org, doesn't have separate
api plugin etc. So this project is about solving issues with the GitLab Jenkins Integration by
improving the current GitLab Plugin and creating separate plugins for GitLab Api and GitLab
Branch Source. One stretch goal is to add GitLab Pipeline support for Blueocean.

=== Issues
* No folder organisation support for GitLab
* No Multibranch Pipeline Job support for GitLab
* GitLab APIs currently used does not have all GitLab APIs features and limits the scope of future expansion
* GitLab Plugin does not follow convention of SCM Plugins i.e. 3 separate plugins for api, build and branch Source
* GitLab Plugin also does not leverage new SCM trait APIs, some features like auto-management of webhooks, password authentication are missing
* No Pipeline Support for GitLab in Blueocean while GitHub and BitBucket are supported

=== Solutions

* [NEW] GitLab Api Plugin that wraps new GitLab Java Api repository which is actively maintained and has almost all GitLab Apis support
* [NEW] GitLab Branch Source Plugin that supports Branch Source Functionality like Github BS, Bitbucket BS etc
* [IMPROVED] GitLab Plugin that is lightweight and provides build triggers, web hooks management and other API support
* [NEW] Pipeline Support for GitLab in Blueocean
