==== Overview
The Working Hour Plugin provides an interface to set up a schedule of allowable build days and times.  Jobs that run outside of configured working hours are held until the next allowable build time.  

==== Why UI improvements
The current Working Hour Plugin provides an interface to set up a schedule of allowable build times but the user interface and usability still need enhancement. Thus a new user interface based on new technologies like React could be used to optimize user experience and code readability.

==== How it is improved
We use React to improve the Plugin UI, while the integration from React to Jenkins plugin is the key point, and we are using a pattern to make this possible, which is then extracted to a code template, the React Plugin Template, for more information about the integration plan, you can read more at link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/react-plugin-template[Github: React Plugin Template]
