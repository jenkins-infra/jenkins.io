The Role Strategy Plugin is one of the most popular Jenkins authorization plugin. On adding a large number of roles to the plugin,
a significant slowdown is visible in the Jenkins Web UI. The project aims to improve the end user experience by improving the
performance of the plugin and creating a reliable performance testing framework which can be used in other Jenkins plugins.

The project is being tracked on Jenkins Jira:

* link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-57415[Community Bonding]
* link:https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-57416[Phase 1]
