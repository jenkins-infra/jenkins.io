title: "Parsing a REST API bad request HTML-formatted response"
goal: "Sometimes a bad request is made to the REST API and Jenkins responds with an HTML body describing the error. I wish to handle these responses in my jenkins-rest scripted client rather than dump the HTML back at the user in their console."
