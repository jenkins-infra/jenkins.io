== Conflict of interest prevention

We will appreciate mentorship provided by any Jenkins contributor.
On the other hand, we want to avoid any conflicts with GSoC rules and spirit.
We also want to avoid conflicts of interest between all sides.

* Only an individual contributor may be a mentor according to GSoC rules.
One or more company representatives may act as individual contributors
* All mentors and org admins are considered as Jenkins community representatives.
They must follow the link:/conduct[Code of Conduct]
* If a mentor works for a company, which use Jenkins in commercial products...
** The mentorship work should be performed during spare time or during the OSS contribution time dedicated by the company.
In the latter case the mentor should ensure that there will be a consistent time dedicated over the entire GSoC mentorship period
** The project proposed by mentors should not overlap neither with direct responsibilities within the company nor with the company product roadmaps.
** He/She should ensure there is no conflict of interest between the project and the work responsibilities

There are several examples below:

* "I would like to have this feature in my Jenkins installation. I have already made a commitment to deliver within my company. I will lose my bonus if I fail the commitment"
** NOT FINE, you have a conflict of interest. GSoC project may fail due to many reasons
* "I would like to have this feature in my Jenkins installation. It would provide us some added value, but we can live without it. I have not made any commitments"
** FINE if the proposed project is useful to a significant part of the community. Added value will keep you motivated
* "This feature has been already announced publicly by my company, we want to ship it as a part of our product"
** NOT FINE, you have a conflict of interest
* "This feature has not been announced publicly by my company, but we will do it after GSoC"
** NOT FINE, you have a conflict of interest
* "Our product may benefit from the feature, but it's not in our roadmaps. The project idea is useful to the community"
** PROBABLY FINE, consult with GSoC Org Admins
* "I want to mentor this feature, but I see that somebody works on the similar feature in open-source"
** PROBABLY FINE, consult with the developers of the competing solution.
Try to join forces and get them as mentors.
* "I want to mentor this project, but I see that another company provides a similar closed-source solution"
** FINE, but ask GSoC Org Admins to contact the company. Maybe they agree to open-source it (and to assign a mentor). If no, it's their problem.
* "I want to implement a feature based on a patented algorithm/technology. It's open-source, so we are free to do whatever"
** NOT FINE, Jenkins project recognizes laws.
We are under umbrella of Software In Public Interest organization, which is a subject for US and international legislation.
Contact the patent holder to get a license (needs a review by Jenkins Governance meeting).
* "I went through the list and still have concerns"
** PROBABLY FINE, contact GSoC Org Admins

All potential issues should be escalated to GSoC admins.
Intentional violation of the rules above may be a subject for Code of Conduct violation process.
