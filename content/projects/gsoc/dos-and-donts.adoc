== The Do's and Don'ts

Participating in open-source can be incredibly rewarding, but it also comes with certain norms and best practices.
Here’s a comprehensive list of do’s and don’ts to help you contribute effectively and respectfully.

=== For Contributors (or Mentees)

&#9989; Do:

1. Do Read the Documentation
  * Carefully read the project's link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/blob/master/README.md[README], link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md[CONTRIBUTING guidelines], and link:/project/conduct/[Code Of Conduct].
  * Understand how to set up the project, what contributions are welcome, and the coding standards.
2. Do Communicate Respectfully
  * Be polite, inclusive, and professional in all interactions, including issues, PRs, comments, and more.
  * Assume good intent in others' contributions and feedback.
3. Do Ask Questions Thoughtfully (After Researching First)
  * You’re expected to be a self-directed learner
  * Try to solve problems yourself first, then ask thoughtful, specific questions.
  * When stuck, ask clear and concise questions. Include what you've tried and what isn’t working. Use GitHub, issue comments, or chat channels (Discourse/Gitter/Slack).
4. Do Be Patient
  * Open source moves at different paces. Mentors/contributors are volunteers who often juggle open-source work alongside full-time jobs, studies, or personal commitments.
  * Rushing or repeatedly pinging reviewers can come off as demanding.
  * Delays in replies or reviews are not a sign of disinterest—they're normal.

&#10060; Don't:

1. Don’t Be Disrespectful or Demanding
  * Open-source is built on volunteerism. Most maintainers, contributors, and mentors are volunteers who donate their time and expertise. Being demanding shows a lack of appreciation and understanding of this.
  * Open-source maintainers are more likely to help those who are kind, respectful, and humble.
2. Don’t Send Private Messages
  * Open-source values public communication
    - Open discussions help the whole community.
    - Others may have the same questions, and public answers help more people.
  * It can be seen as unprofessional or pushy
    - Mentors are often busy volunteers.
    - Unsolicited DMs (especially with vague questions or self-promotion) can come off as entitled or impatient.
  * You might miss out on better feedback
    - Mentors may prefer questions in GitHub, mailing lists, or chat channels where other contributors can also respond or add context.
3. Don’t Ask For Personal Favors
  * It’s Unprofessional and Should Never Be Asked
    - GSoC is not a personal mentorship or tutoring program—it's a collaborative open-source initiative.
    - They are inappropriate unless a strong, long-term professional relationship has been built after the program.
  * It Can Damage Your Reputation
    - Asking for personal favors may come across as entitled or opportunistic.
    - It could affect how you're perceived (which is small and self-seeking) in the open-source community.
  * Mentors are volunteers
    - They contribute their time and expertise to help improve open-source software, not to fulfill personal requests.
4. Don’t Ignore Feedback
  * Be open to constructive criticism. Incorporate feedback into your code and learn from it.

=== For Mentors

&#9989; Do:

1. Do Set Clear Expectations Early
  * Define communication channels, response times, work habits, and milestones.
  * Discuss mutual availability and time zones during the community bonding period.
2. Do Foster a Supportive Environment
  * Be patient and approachable.
  * Create space for questions and learning, especially since mentees may be new to open source.
  * Explain complex concepts in a way that fits the mentee's experience level.
  * Celebrate wins, even small ones—positive reinforcement builds confidence.
3. Do Be Inclusive and Respectful
  * Encourage mentees regardless of background, gender, or experience.
  * Be an example of empathy, respect, and encouragement.
4. Do Provide Timely Feedback
  * Regularly review pull requests, proposals, and progress reports.
  * Give clear, constructive, actionable but kind feedback—praise good work too.
5. Do Encourage Independent Thinking
  * Guide, don’t micromanage.
  * Encourage mentees to investigate and propose solutions, then offer direction when needed.
6. Do Help Mentees Understand the Codebase
  * Point them to useful parts of the code, docs, or historical issues/PRs.
  * Offer walkthrough's or suggest tools to understand the structure.
7. Do Promote Best Practices
  * Encourage clean code, documentation, testing, and community interaction.
  * Help them develop habits that extend beyond GSoC.
8. Do Track and Support Progress
  * Keep an eye on the project timeline and help mentees adjust the scope if necessary.
  * Be proactive if a mentee is struggling or disengaging.

&#10060; Don't:

1. Don’t Go Silent
  * Inconsistent communication confuses and demoralizes mentees.
  * If you're unavailable temporarily, inform your co-mentor and the mentee.
2. Don’t Be Harsh or Dismissive
  * Avoid discouraging criticism like “this is wrong” without explanation.
  * Mentees are here to learn—create a psychologically safe space.
3. Don’t Expect Mentees to Be Experts
GSoC is a learning program, not a job.
  * Be forgiving of mistakes and focus on growth, not perfection.
4. Don’t Ignore Red Flags
  * If a mentee is unresponsive, plagiarizing, or violating the code of conduct, take it seriously.
  * Escalate to the org admin if needed.
5. Don’t Focus Only on the Deliverables
  * Help mentees grow as contributors and community members, not just produce code.
  * Foster long-term involvement in open source.
6. Refrain from Accepting Requests for Personal Favors
  * Instead, encourage the mentee to revisit and review this guide.
