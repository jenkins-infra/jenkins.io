*Roles and Responsibilities*

*1. Champion / Project champion mentor*

Champion: The person proposing and driving the project idea

Project champion mentor: this is the mentor who proposes the idea, but may not have all the Jenkins code expertise needed. This mentor works with the student to define the project and acts mostly as a "customer" of the project. This mentor usually know enough about coding to comment on pull-requests with regards to the over quality, style and features of the code.

*2. Technical mentor*

Technical mentor: this is the mentor who knows enough about the Jenkins code to guide the student on coding, and to provide Jenkins specific code reviews on pull-requests, but has limited involvement outside the coding activity of the student.

*3. Potential Mentors*

Mentors are people who have accepted the potential student. Mentoring is a committment of approximately 5 to 8 hours per week. In return, you get a motivated student to work on your project 35 to 40 hours per week.

*4. Subject Matter Expert / Not a mentor*

A technical advisor is one type of subject matter expert.
