**Short description**

Jenkins is a popular open source automation server which is used for building, testing, CI/CD, deployment and many other use-cases. Our motto is "Build great things at any scale".

{nbsp} +

**Long description (Markdown)**

link:/[Jenkins], originally founded in 2006 as "Hudson", is one of the leading automation servers.
Jenkins' motto is "Build great things at any scale".
Using an extensible, plugin-based architecture developers have created hundreds of plugins to adapt Jenkins to a multitude of build, test, and deployment automation workloads.
Jenkins is open-source, link:https://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php[MIT License] is used for most of the components.

This year we invite potential GSoC contributors to join the Jenkins community and to work together to improve Jenkins.
We have many strategic project ideas which are important to hundreds of thousands of Jenkins users.

The project has over 600 active contributors working on Jenkins core, plugins, website, project infrastructure, localization activities, etc.
In total we have more than 2,000 components including plugins, libraries, and various utilities.
The main languages in the project are Java, Groovy and JavaScript, but we also have components written in other languages (Go, C/C++, C#, etc.).
Jenkins project includes multiple sub-projects (including link:/projects/jcasc/[Configuration-as-Code], link:/projects/infrastructure/[Infrastructure] and link:/projects/remoting/[Remoting]) and link:/sigs/[special interest groups].
These entities participate in GSoC as a part of the Jenkins project.

The Jenkins project is a part of link:https://cd.foundation/[Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF)].

=== Contributor Guidance

_Provide your potential contributors with a page containing tips on how to write a successful proposal for your organization. Let them know what you want included, how you want it structured, and how to best get in touch. link:https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/contributor-guidance[Examples]._

Welcome and thank you for your interest!
To apply to the organization, please follow the link:https:/projects/gsoc/students/#student-application-process[guidelines on our website].

Before submitting please go through the link:https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/[GSoC contributor guide] and the link:/projects/gsoc/contributors/[Jenkins GSoC contributor guide] which documents Jenkins specific requirements. Participating in Google Summer of Code requires 15-20 hours commitment a week over several months. If it may overlap with your study, internship, work or other commitments, we recommend you plan accordingly.
If you have any questions about the application process, please feel free to contact us via link:https://community.jenkins.io/tag/gsoc[Jenkins GSoC Discourse] or in the link:https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#jenkinsci_gsoc-sig:gitter.im[jenkinsci/gsoc-sig Gitter] chat. We also have weekly meetings which are open to everyone.

=== Communication Methods

== Organization Questionnaire

=== Why does your organization want to participate in GSoC?

In our community we are interested to have more contributors in both the Jenkins core and 1,800+ existing plugins. GSoC is an opportunity to find new contributors interested in software development automation (continuous integration and continuous delivery).
It also helps to get existing contributors more involved in community work. We have previously participated in GSoC 2016-2021.
We gained valuable experience, especially regarding the student selection process.
We received significant contributions and are still using those contributions in the project.
We are confident that we can host a successful Google Summer of Code 2022 in the Jenkins project.


{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +


=== What would your organization consider to be a successful GSoC program?

A successful Jenkins GSoC program consists of:

* A positive and enjoyable experience for both GSoC contributors and mentors, where the project’s goals provide a sense of challenge and rewarding learning experience.
* Contributor’s code contributions play a part in the betterment of Jenkins resulting in benefit for Jenkins users
* GSoC contributors are inspired to contribute to Jenkins after the program and return as a GSoC mentor in the future.

{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +

=== How will you keep mentors engaged with their GSoC contributors?

* We have explicit expectations from mentors, they are documented in our link:/projects/gsoc/mentors[mentor guidelines].
  All mentors commit to these expectations during the project selection.
* Each GSoC contributor will have at least 2 mentors AND an org admin advisor assigned to the project.
* Mentors are expected to be accomplished Jenkins contributors, who are passionate about community/mentorship work.
* Mentors are highly interested in the project they are mentoring
* Mentors are directly involved in the GSoC contributor selection and interview processes so they will establish early connections with GSoC contributors
* Org admins will be monitoring mentor/GSoC contributor interaction starting from the application phase and intervene if needed
* There will be regular sync-ups between org admins and mentors


{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +


=== How will you keep your GSoC contributors on schedule to complete their projects?

* During the Application phase and Community Bonding phase mentors will share their expertise to define realistic project plans.
* The GSoC contributor project milestones will be discussed and confirmed between mentors and GSoC contributors. Milestones will be aligned with GSoC contributor evaluations and will have clear expectations defined.
* Mentors will set up regular meetings with their GSoC contributor (at least weekly) in order to sync-up on projects.
* Retrospectives with GSoC contributors will be held after each evaluation.
* Mentors should be available for questions. They should also provide periodic feedback on the progress and on the performance of particular GSoC contributors (1x1).
* Weekly public GSoC office-hours allow GSoC contributors, mentors, and organization administrators to meet, plan, and review. (or two meetings if time-zones require it) and private ones between mentors and org admins to sync-up
* We will encourage frequent push to branches so that the GSoC contributors show progress and keep changes atomic.


{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +


=== How will you get your GSoC contributors involved in your community during GSoC?

* GSoC contributors will cooperate with the Jenkins community during the project. Community Bonding will be a critical phase for us.
* Projects will handled under an umbrella of SIGs or sub-projects so that non-mentor stakeholders and early adopters are included in the projects
* GSoC contributors will be participating in sub-project/SIG meetings and presenting their work on a regular basis
* Org Admins will provide an introductory training (community overview, code-of-conduct, etc.), then mentors will help GSoC contributors establish contacts with experts from the community
* We expect GSoC contributors to be around in public chats and other communication channels during the “working days”
* GSoC contributors will be involved in all standard processes in our community (pull requests, code reviews, chats and mailing lists, test automation, documentation, online meetups, etc.).
* GSoC contributors will be encouraged to give updates to the wider community via the Jenkins blog and Jenkins online meetups
