=== Motivation

Infra team would like to to perform deeper monitoring of specific jobs on ci.jenkins.io and infra.ci.jenkins.io.
The introduction of OpenTelemetry would allow us to do this.
OpenTelemetry is a collection of APIs, SDKs, and tools used to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) to help analyzing software performance and behavior.
With proper design and orchestration of the different moving parts of OpenTelemetry, we hope that the contributor completing the project will be able to gain invaluable experience in implementing observability tooling to the Jenkins project.


=== Project Size
This project is of medium size and is expected to be completed in ~175 hours.
