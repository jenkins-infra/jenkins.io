=== Background

Currently, neither the Jenkins Git plugin nor the Jenkins Git Client plugin support the use of bearer token authentication. This project would add support for bearer token authentication to both plugins. One of the issue is to investigate the use cases of this feature and to design the implementation to support those use cases.


=== Project Size
This project is of medium size and is expected to be completed in ~175 hours.
