=== Background

This full-stack project focuses on a proof-of-concept (PoC) to fine-tune an existing open-source LLM model Llama 2 with domain-specific Jenkins data to be compiled, wrangled, and processed by the contributor as a part of an application to be developed, with a minimalistic UI to interact with the user.
The contributor will get to be involved in every step of the application development process, from data collection, wrangling, and processing to fine-tuning the model and developing the UI.
