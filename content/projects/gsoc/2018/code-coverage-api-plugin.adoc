=== Overview

There are a lot of plugins which currently implement code coverage, however, they all use similar config, charts, and content. So it will be much better if we can have an API plugin which does the most repeated work for those plugins and offers a unified APIs which can be consumed by other plugins and external tools.

=== Supported Tools
* Embedded tools
** JaCoCo
* Other plugins as an Extension of Code Coverage API plugin
** Cobertura (https://github.com/jenkinsci/cobertura-plugin[Cobertura Plugin])
** llvm-cov (https://github.com/jenkinsci/llvm-cov-plugin[llvm-cov Plugin])

=== Architecture

This API plugin will mainly do these things:

. Find coverage reports according to the userâ€™s config.
. Use adapters to convert reports into the our standard format.
. Parse standard format reports, and aggregate them.
. Show parsed result in a chart.

So, we can implement code coverage publishing by simply writing an adapter, and such adapter only needs to do one thing - convert a coverage report into the standard format. The implementation is based on extension points, so new adapters can be created in separate plugins. In order to simplify conversion for XML reports, there is also an abstraction layer which allows creating XSLT-based converters.
