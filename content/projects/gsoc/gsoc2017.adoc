WARNING: This is an archived page about Jenkins project participation in Google Summer of Code 2017.
See link:/projects/gsoc[the main GSoC project] page of the information about other years.

== Status

In 2017 Jenkins application has not been accepted to Google Summer of Code.
This page contains some information, which may be reused in the future.

== Project Ideas 

=== Plugin Conversion to Blue Ocean

One of the major initiatives in the Jenkins project is an updated interface and user experience, called link:/projects/blueocean/[Blue Ocean]. 
Some of the popular Jenkins plugins will require conversion to the Blue Ocean plugin architecture.

Students will use modern technologies (e.g. React, NodeJS, and/or Java) to help convert the most widely used plugins to work with Blue Ocean with help from Blue Ocean core developers.
We expect students to select a particular plugin (or plugins) together with potential mentors and then to come up with a list of improvements to be made.

Prerequisites:

* Basic knowledge of the Web development area
* Basic knowledge of Java and JavaScript programming languages

Potential mentors: link:https://github.com/kzantow[Keith Zantow] and other Blue Ocean team members

=== EDA tool integration plugin

The idea is to create a Jenkins plugin for one of the widely used Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools. 

Tools from both ASIC or FPGA design flow are acceptable. 
We are ready to consider conditionally-free and open-source tools, which would be available to the student and his mentors. 

Prerequisites:

* Basic knowledge of the hardware engineering area
* Basic knowledge of Java programming language
* Hands-on experience with the selected EDA tool
* In the case of FPGA flows it would be useful to have a prototyping board as well

=== Support core plugin improvements 

It is often difficult for plugins developers to diagnose issues and analyse the user environment.

The link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Support+Core+Plugin[Support Core plugin] allows users to generate a bundle to help on this but it is nowadays rarely used because it is isn't user friendly.
Various fixes and improvements may help our community a lot. 

Few ideas of new features to add:

* Ease the management of bundles (UI to list, delete, browse, download bundles) - link:https://issue-redirect.jenkins.io/issue/33090[JENKINS-33090]
* Provide anonymisation of the support bundle contents by default - link:https://issue-redirect.jenkins.io/issue/21670[JENKINS-21670]
* Submission of bundles in link:https://issues.jenkins.io[our bug tracker] - link:https://issue-redirect.jenkins.io/issue/33090[JENKINS-33090]
* etc.

Prerequisites:

* Basic knowledge of Jenkins (as a user)
* Basic knowledge of Java programming language
