== Background
As Jenkins continues to evolve, users often seek efficient ways to navigate its extensive documentation, plugins, and community discussions. This project proposes the development of an AI-powered chatbot integrated into the Jenkins interface, enabling users to retrieve information swiftly through natural language queries.

== Project Description**
The aim is to create a Jenkins plugin that embeds a chatbot capable of understanding and responding to user inquiries about Jenkins. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, the chatbot will interpret user questions and provide relevant information from official documentation, plugin repositories, and community forums.
The project was begun in GSoC 2025, and this continuation will focus on enhancing the chatbot's capabilities, improving its accuracy, and expanding its knowledge base.
Currently, it is still incomplete.
We may also consider adding new features such as adding agentic mode, multi-turn conversations, or voice interaction.
We are looking for a contributor to continue the work and to complete it in GSoC 2026.

== Benefits to the Community

- **Enhanced User Experience:** Users can obtain information quickly without leaving the Jenkins environment.
- **Improved Accessibility:** Simplifies the learning curve for newcomers by providing instant answers to common questions.
- **Increased Productivity:** Reduces the time spent searching for resources, allowing users to focus on development and deployment tasks.


== Comparable Solutions
While there are existing AI chatbots in various domains, an AI assistant tailored specifically for Jenkins is limited. A community discussion highlighted interest in developing a Jenkins Assistant plugin, indicating a demand for such a tool. This project aims to fill that gap by offering a specialized solution within the Jenkins ecosystem.


== Project Scope

- **Chatbot Development:** Implement NLP models to process and understand user queries related to Jenkins.
- **Integration:** Develop a Jenkins plugin to host the chatbot, ensuring seamless interaction within the Jenkins user interface.
- **Data Sources:** Configure the chatbot to access and retrieve information from Jenkins documentation, plugin directories, and community forums.
- **User Interface:** Design an intuitive chat interface within Jenkins for user interactions.


== Quickstart
To get started:

1. **Familiarize Yourself with Jenkins Plugin Development:** Review the link:/doc/developer/tutorial/[Jenkins Plugin Tutorial].
2. **Explore Relevant AI Libraries:** Investigate NLP frameworks such as link:https://www.nltk.org/[NLTK], link:https://spacy.io/[spaCy], link:https://pytorch.org/[PyTorch], link:https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/[LlamaIndex], etc., that can be integrated into Python applications.
3. **Understand Existing Chatbot Implementations:** Study existing chatbot plugins or tools to gather insights into design and functionality.

== Newbie-friendly Issues
Potential applicants can explore the following tasks to prepare:

- **Jenkins Plugin Development:** Start by creating a simple plugin to understand the basics of Jenkins plugin architecture.
- **NLP Model Training:** Experiment with training NLP models on sample datasets to grasp the fundamentals of natural language understanding.
- **Community Engagement:** Participate in Jenkins forums and Gitter channels to understand common user queries and challenges.

They are also encouraged to contribute to the issues of the project repo at link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/resources-ai-chatbot-plugin/[jenkinsci/resources-ai-chatbot-plugin]

By undertaking these preliminary tasks, contributors can build a solid foundation for developing an AI-powered chatbot that enhances the Jenkins user experience.
