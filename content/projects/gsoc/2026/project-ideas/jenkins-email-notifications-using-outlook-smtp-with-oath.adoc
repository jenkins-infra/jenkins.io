== Background

Jenkins can send email notifications using the email-ext plugin. However, many email providers, including Outlook, are moving away from traditional username/password authentication methods in favor of more secure OAuth-based authentication. This project aims to enhance the email-ext plugin by adding support for OAuth authentication with Outlook SMTP, specifically using the client credentials flow.


== Summary

* Implement OAuth authentication support in the email-ext plugin for Outlook SMTP.
* Ensure secure storage and handling of OAuth tokens within Jenkins.
* Provide configuration options in the Jenkins UI for setting up OAuth with Outlook SMTP.
* Test the implementation thoroughly to ensure reliable email delivery using OAuth authentication.
* Document the new feature, including setup instructions and usage guidelines.


== Skills to Study and Improve

* OAuth authentication
* Jenkins plugin development
* Email protocols (SMTP)
* Secure token management


== Project Size

175 hours.


== Project Difficulty Level
Intermediate


== Expected Outcomes
* A modified version of the email-ext plugin that supports OAuth authentication with Outlook SMTP.
* Comprehensive documentation detailing the setup and configuration process for using OAuth with Outlook SMTP in Jenkins.
* Test cases and results demonstrating the reliability and security of the new authentication method.
* Contribution of the new feature to the official email-ext plugin repository, subject to review and approval by the Jenkins community.
* Engagement with the Jenkins community to gather feedback and iterate on the implementation as needed.
* Details to be clarified interactively, together with the mentors, during the Contributor Application drafting phase.
