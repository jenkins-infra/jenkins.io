=== Background
As Jenkins continues to evolve despite being a more mature CI/CD tool, users often seek efficient ways to navigate its extensive documentation, plugins, and community discussions. This project proposes the development of an AI-powered chatbot integrated into the Jenkins interface, enabling users to retrieve information swiftly through natural language queries.
We believe that an AI chatbot can significantly enhance the user experience by providing quick access to relevant information, guiding users through workflows, and assisting in troubleshooting common issues.
The project aims to leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to create a chatbot that understands user queries and provides accurate responses based on Jenkins resources.
The contributor will work closely with the mentors to design, develop, and integrate the chatbot into the Jenkins ecosystem.
