=== Background

* Browser automation is a known thing and is an interesting idea to explore for the Jenkins project
* Basic idea is to convert the steps from a human-readable format to a set of computer operations
* This idea is relatively light-weight and is expected to require no more than a few months' time to complete
* Could be in almost any language, it is a separate dev tool

=== Project details

* May be extended to render a series of screenshots assembled as gif or mp4
* How would we define the steps needed?
    - A YAML format to describe the steps
    - Capybara in Ruby expresses UI automation in English phrasing
* How to reduce images to the relevant portion could also be considered
    - Focusing on an element is a known Javascript technique
    - Reducing image size is a more complicated procedure, but feasible

=== Expected outcomes

New tool to maintain documentation screenshots

Documentation screenshots will be updated automatically based on steps defined as code.
The steps will be a small domain-specific language that describe common Jenkins UI operations in a way that documentation writers understand.
