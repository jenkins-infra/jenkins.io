=== Background

In the GSoC of 2022, link:/blog/authors/alecharp/[Adrien Lecharpentier] and link:/blog/authors/dheerajodha/[Dheeraj Singh Jodha] developed the starting foundation of what we are calling Plugin Health Scores. 
This project measures plugins with various probes across various areas and computes a composite score for each plugin.

One important piece that we think would be a great project for GSoC 2023, is the display of those scores on link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/[plugins.jenkins.io] and the details for each individual plugin.

Here is a wire frame of the basic idea of displaying the composite scores:
