=== Background
I've been playing with CI/CD for mobile apps for more than eight years (mostly with gitlab-ci).
Since last June, I am experimenting with Jenkins to build and publish Android apps, mostly with Docker.
I already have a working prototype and gave a talk 1 about it last month.

The thing is I created that very naively, starting with my old Gitlab habits.
Furthermore, I was not looking for the perfect Android apps building Jenkins architecture, just a Jenkins system that would allow anyone to start it with just one command line.
That's why I went the docker-compose way. The proof of concept works under Windows, Linux, Vagrant, macOS (x86 and ARM), and mostly on Gitpod, butâ€¦ It's not (yet) something you can copy and paste to production.
It is composed of a Jenkins controller (using JCasc), an Android agent, a generic Docker agent, an Android emulator, and an Android device farm (STF 1).

The idea is to have a more precise status of what can be done now with Jenkins. We could then amend the existing documentation 1, and describe architectures for:

* Standalone Android projects
* Android apps building farms
* Android distro building (customized AOSP)
