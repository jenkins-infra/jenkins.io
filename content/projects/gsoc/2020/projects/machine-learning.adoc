The main goal of this project is integrating Machine Learning workflow including Data preprocessing, Model Training, Evaluation and Prediction with Jenkins build tasks. This plugin will be capable of executing code fragments via IPython kernel as currently supported by Jupyter Notebook. Version control will be handled as an added advantage of this project.

=== Deliverables

* An IPython plugin with pipeline compatible
* Improved config.jelly for the plugin
* File parsers for ipynb, py and text(containing python code) files
* Code segment extractor 
* Implement a code editor
* Output console with static visual components

=== Community Bonding

The community bonding period is all about, well, community bonding. Rather than jumping straight into coding, I've got some time to learn about Jenkins's processes - release and otherwise - developer interactions, codes of conduct, etc.
