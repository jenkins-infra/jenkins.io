The main idea behind the project is to build a customizable Jenkins distribution service that could be used to build tailor-made Jenkins distributions. The service would provide users with a simple interface to select the configurations they want to build the instance with eg: plugins, authorization matrices etc. Furthermore it would include a section for sharing community created distros so that users can find and download already built Jenkins war/configuration files to use out of the box.

=== Key Deliverables
* A backend service built on spring boot having a modern Restful API support for constructing a  customized WAR package and configuration files.
* A configuration constructing engine that can convert UI fields into a configuration file.
* Front End application in the form of a website with a simple user interface for the users to interact with and customize the distribution.
* Repository sharing community built most commonly used Jenkins configuration files.

=== Plan for Phase 1 

* Develop a simple workflow(Spring Boot Application) from UI bindings to the generation of the JCasC YAML file.
  ** Reuse concepts from the JCasC Plugin to generate this JCasC file. 
  ** Verify the configuration generated against the JCasC Schema.
* Begin with a simple User Interface to test the workflow against.
* Reuse logic from the jenkins core to construct and if possible render the user interface in react for all the plugins.
* If the rendering is not possible, default to building the schemas from the data bound constructors or the JCasC Schema.
* Blog Post for Phase 1.


=== Evaluation Phase 1

  - Features:
  ** War Generation
  ** Support package generation
  ** Develop a plugin selection API
  ** Supports UI to select plugins.
  ** Support pagination for 1700 plugins.
  ** Support package configuration download.
  ** Front-end support to generate custom packages.

=== Plan for Phase 2

* Utilize the link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/custom-war-packager[Custom War Packager (CWP)] tool for heavy lifting and converting the configuration file to a WAR package.
* If necessary, implement a new wrapper around CWP so some logic can be reused from here
* Integration of the above  wrapper into the service.
 ** This step should be relatively simple since the CWP library is fairly straightforward.
* The service should really take shape after this week since we would have build the entire workflow from:
UI -> Config -> War Package
* Work on hosting the service.
* Blog Post for Phase 2.


=== Evaluation Phase 2

  - Features:
  ** War Download Feature.
  ** Filters for plugin list.
  ** Support community configurations.
  ** Support for custom community configurations.
  ** Docker support to run the service.
  ** Pull request creation support.
  ** Caching support for plugin list which improved performance

=== Plan for Phase 3

* Work on community hosted repositories for most used configuration files.
* Set up a github repository(Source of Truth) with the configs, allowing users to share their configs either via the service
* Workflow supported: Service -> Github
* Login feature for users  via Github or jenkins.io.
* Work on developing the database schema to store the user generated configurations.
* Integration of database into the service.
** Spring boot makes it quite easy to integrate mongoDB into its architecture so we could leverage that to be able to store private user configurations.
** Add the Database to the service and introduce this feature as a Beta Release
* Accomplish any remaining goals like tests cases and publish releases of a new plugin if necessary

=== Evaluation Phase 3

  - Features:
  ** Hosting on a jenkins.io link:https://customize.jenkins.io/[subdomain].
  ** Rigorous testing support.
  ** Code Quality Checks.
  ** Self-hosting capabilities.
  ** User guide.
