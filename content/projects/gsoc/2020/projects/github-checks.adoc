The link:https://developer.github.com/v3/checks/[GitHub Checks API] allows developers to report the CI integrationsâ€™ detail information rather than the binary pass/fail build status on GitHub pages. 
This project is about implementing this API as a new Jenkins plugin. 
By consuming this API, other plugins can easily create GitHub checks. 
Thus, any information during the Jenkins process like warnings, summaries, and durations can be directly shown on GitHub pages.

=== Project Deliverables
* A new Jenkins plugin (link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/checks-api-plugin[Checks API Plugin]) that defines the general checks API
* A new Jenkins plugin (link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/github-checks-plugin[GitHub Checks Plugin]) that implements the general checks API for GitHub
* A new feature (link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin/pull/550[pull request #550]) for plugin:warnings-ng[Warnings Next Generation Plugin] to report warnings to GitHub by consuming the checks API
* A new feature (link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/code-coverage-api-plugin/pull/169[pull request #169]) for plugin:code-coverage-api[Code Coverage API Plugin] to report code coverage to GitHub by consuming the checks API
* Pipeline support feature (link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/checks-api-plugin/pull/7[pull request #7]) to allow users to publish checks from their pipeline
* Rerun support feature (link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/github-checks-plugin/pull/25[pull request #25]) on GitHub to allow users requesting a rebuild for failed builds
