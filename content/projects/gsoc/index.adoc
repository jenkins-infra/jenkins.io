link:https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/[Google Summer of Code]
(GSoC) is a global, online program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development. GSoC Contributors work with an open source organization on a 12+ week programming project under the guidance of mentors.

GSoC contributors accepted into the program receive a stipend,
paid by Google, to work well-defined projects to improve or enhance the Jenkins
project.
In exchange, numerous Jenkins community members volunteer as "mentors"
for GSoC contributors to help integrate them into the open source community and succeed
in completing their projects.

== GSoC 2022

We plan to participate in Google Summer of Code 2022.
See the link:./2022/project-ideas[current project ideas].

NOTE: There are some changes in how GSoC 2021/2022 is organized, including duration of the projects.
Jenkins GSoC documentation may be outdated in some places,
please refer to the https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/[official GSoC website] as a source of truth.
Our documentation will be updated over time to reflect the changes in the GSoC program,
please report any issues you discover.

== Contacts

* We use the link:/sigs/gsoc[GSoC SIG] for communications about GSoC.
Projects may also have their own mailing lists, chats and meetings.
See details on project pages.
* We use link:https://community.jenkins.io/c/contributing/gsoc/6[Discourse] for discussions.
  This is the **recommended** channel for communications
* There is also a link:https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/gsoc-sig[GSoC Gitter channel] for real-time communications,
   but it is better to use Discourse to request technical feedback or to have long discussions

=== GSoC Discourse 

Public communication channel: link:https://community.jenkins.io/c/contributing/gsoc/6[GSoC Discourse].

The purpose of GSoC Discourse is for all public communications on GSoC such as new mentor and new GSoC contributor introductions,
project proposal questions and discussions, process and timeline related questions. For private matters such as communication
difficulties with mentors, GSoC contributors, or org admins, please use the admin mailing list shown link:#orgadmin[below].

1. To start, you need a Google or Gmail account
2. After clicking the link, a "Sign in" button appears in the top-right of the page
3. After sign in, a "Join group" button appears in the middle of the page
4. To learn more about joining a Google Group, please see https://support.google.com/groups/answer/1067205

=== Chats

* link:https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/gsoc-sig[GSoC Gitter channel] for organizational topics related to Jenkins in GSoC
* `#gsoc` channel in the CDF Slack workspace for organization-wide topics (link:/chat/#continuous-delivery-foundation[how to join])
* Project-specific chats, see project and project idea pages
* link:/chat/[Common developer chats] for technical topics

=== Office hours

Although we use Discourse as the main communication channel,
we also have regular "office hours" video calls.
During these timeslots Jenkins GSoC org admins and mentors are available for any GSoC-related questions.

* Schedule: weekly 30 minutes meeting. Office hours will be alternating between APAC (3AM UTC) and EMEA (2PM UTC) time zones. First meeting will be on February 4 at 3AM UTC.
* link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OpvMWpzBKtKnYBAkhtQ1dK5zQix3D7RY5g3vDJXkSnc/edit?usp=sharing[Agenda]
* Meetings are commonly recorded on-demand and posted link:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN7ajX_VdyaO1f6bvkcSzW4PdWKkLktRG[here].

This meeting will be used for Q&A with GSoC apllicants/contributors and mentors before the announcement of accepted projects as well as during the GSoC program.
You can add the office hours to your calendar when you visit the link:/event-calendar[Jenkins event calendar].
More slots may be added on-demand, e.g. for project-specific discussions.

In addition to these organization-wide meetings,
each GSoC project has regular meetings during community bonding and coding phases.
See the project pages for the schedule.
