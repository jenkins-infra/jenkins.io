link:https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/[Google Summer of Code]
(GSoC) is an annual, international, program which encourages
college-aged students to participate with open source projects during the summer
break between classes.

Students accepted into the program receive a stipend,
paid by Google, to work well-defined projects to improve or enhance the Jenkins
project.
In exchange, numerous Jenkins community members volunteer as "mentors"
for students to help integrate them into the open source community and succeed
in completing their summer projects.

== GSoC 2020

We plan to apply for Google Summer of Code 2020.
The program has not started yet, stay tuned for announcements.
Nevertheless, we invite potential mentors and students to contact us and to propose project ideas.

== Contacts

* We use the link:/sigs/gsoc[GSoC SIG] for communications about GSoC.
Projects may also have their own mailing lists, chats and meetings.
See details on project pages.
* We use link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jenkinsci-gsoc-all-public[mailing list] for discussions.
  This is the **recommended** channel for communications
* There is also a link:https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/gsoc-sig:[GSoC Gitter channel] for real-time communications,
   but it is better to use mailing lists to request technical feedback or to have long discussions

=== Mailing lists

Public Google Group: link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jenkinsci-gsoc-all-public[jenkinsci-gsoc-all-public].

The purpose of this mailing list is for all public communications on GSoC such as new mentor and new student introductions,
project proposal questions and discussions, process and timeline related questions. For private matters such as communication
difficulties with mentors, students, or org admins, please use the admin mailing list shown link:#orgadmin[below].

1. To start, you need a Google or Gmail account
2. After clicking above link, a "Sign in" button appears in top-right of page
3. After sign in, a "Join group" button appears in middle of page
4. To learn more about joining a Google Group, please see https://support.google.com/groups/answer/1067205

=== Chats

** link:https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/gsoc-sig[GSoC Gitter channel] for organizational topics
** Project chats for project idea discussions.
   Each project idea references a recommended chat in the description.
** link:/chat/[Common developer chats] for technical topics

=== Office hours

Although we use mailing lists as the main communication channel,
we also have regular "office hours" video calls.
During these timeslots Jenkins GSoC org admins and mentors are available for any GSoC-related questions.

Before the announcement of accepted projects,
we will be using a weekly link:/sigs/gsoc[GSoC SIG] meeting as the office hours slot (2PM UTC on Wednesdays).
You can add the office hours to your calendar when you visit the link:/event-calendar[Jenkins event calendar].

More slots may be added in the future.
We post links in link:https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/gsoc-sig[our Gitter channel]
before the meeting starts.
Meetings are recorded on-demand and posted link:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN7ajX_VdyaO1f6bvkcSzW4PdWKkLktRG[here].

In addition to these organization-wide meetings,
each GSoC project has regular meetings during community bonding and coding phases.
See the project pages for the schedule.
