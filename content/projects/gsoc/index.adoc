(GSoC) is a global, online program focused on bringing students and new contributors into open source software development. GSoC Contributors work with an open source organization on a 10-22 weeks programming project under the guidance of mentors.

GSoC contributors accepted into the program receive a stipend,
paid by Google, to work well-defined projects to improve or enhance the Jenkins project.
In exchange, numerous Jenkins community members volunteer as "mentors"
for GSoC contributors to help integrate them into the open source community and succeed
in completing their projects.

A kick-off meeting will be organized right after.

**link:./2023/project-ideas[2023 GSoC project ideas list]**.

We held two webinars explaining how to get prepared and how we will move forward. 
One was focusing on students/contributors. (link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_sTkGtTix8[recording])
The other was aimed at mentors and mentor candidates. (link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGTZtKjVlK0[recording])


//Uncomment when further in the selection process

NOTE: Every year, there are changes in how GSoC is organized.
Jenkins GSoC documentation may be outdated in some places,
please refer to the https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/[official GSoC website] as a source of truth.
Our documentation will be updated over time to reflect the changes in the GSoC program,
please report any issues you discover.

== Org Admins

Org Admins are the people managing the GSoC program for the Jenkins Organization. 
For 2023, Org Admins are:

* Alyssa Tong
* Jean-Marc Meessen
* Kris Stern
* Bruno Verachten

The following checklists and documents describe the role.

* link:https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/oa-tips[Org Admin tips by Google]

== Contacts

* We use the link:/sigs/gsoc[GSoC SIG] for communications about GSoC.
Projects may also have their own mailing lists, chats and meetings.
See details on project pages.
* We use link:https://community.jenkins.io/c/contributing/gsoc/6[Discourse] for discussions.
  This is the **recommended** channel for communications
* There is also a link:https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#jenkinsci_gsoc-sig:gitter.im[GSoC Gitter channel] for real-time communications,
  but it is better to use Discourse to request technical feedback or to have long discussions
* For private matters such as communication difficulties with mentors, GSoC contributors, or Org Admins, 
  please use the this mailto:gsoc-jenkins-org-admin@googlegroups.com[group email].

=== GSoC Discourse 

Public communication channel: link:https://community.jenkins.io/c/contributing/gsoc/6[GSoC Discourse].

The purpose of GSoC Discourse is for all public communications on GSoC such as new mentor and new GSoC contributor introductions,
project proposal questions and discussions, process and timeline related questions. 

=== Chats

* link:https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#jenkinsci_gsoc-sig:gitter.im[GSoC Gitter channel] for organizational topics related to Jenkins in GSoC
* Project-specific chats, see project and project idea pages
* link:/chat/[Common developer chats] for technical topics

=== Office hours

Although we use Discourse as the main communication channel,
we also have regular "office hours" video calls.
During these time slots Jenkins GSoC org admins and mentors are available for any GSoC-related questions.

* Schedule: weekly 30 minutes meeting. Office hours will be alternating between APAC (3AM UTC) and EMEA (2PM UTC) time zones. First meeting will be on February 4 at 3AM UTC.
* link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OpvMWpzBKtKnYBAkhtQ1dK5zQix3D7RY5g3vDJXkSnc/edit?usp=sharing[Agenda]
* Meetings are commonly recorded on-demand and posted link:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN7ajX_VdyaO1f6bvkcSzW4PdWKkLktRG[here].

This meeting will be used for Q&A with GSoC applicants/contributors and mentors before the announcement of accepted projects as well as during the GSoC program.
You can add the office hours to your calendar when you visit the link:/event-calendar[Jenkins event calendar].
More slots may be added on-demand, e.g. for project-specific discussions.

In addition to these organization-wide meetings,
each GSoC project has regular meetings during community bonding and coding phases.
See the project pages for the schedule.
