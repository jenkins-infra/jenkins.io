(GSoC) is a global, online program focused on bringing students and new contributors into open source software development. GSoC Contributors work with an open source organization on a 12+ weeks-long programming project under the guidance of dedicated mentors.

GSoC contributors accepted into the program receive a stipend and are sponsored by Google, to work on well-defined projects to improve or enhance the Jenkins project.
In exchange, numerous Jenkins community members volunteer as "mentors" for the selected GSoC contributors to help integrate them into the open source community and succeed in completing their projects.

== Mentors

Mentors are volunteers who help GSoC contributors to succeed in their projects.
If you are interested in contributing to GSoC as a mentor, and have had either some GSoC contributor experience or have done mentoring before, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.
We are always looking for new mentors to help us with the program.

== Org Admins

Org Admins are the people managing the GSoC program for the Jenkins Organization.
For 2026, our Org Admins are:


* Kris Stern
* Shivay Lamba
* Vutukuri Sreenivas

The following checklists and documents describe the role:

* link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tShnTyka5fdBxaE0c93ptu-J_XTlSf3tKwJemhx5_nA/edit?usp=sharing[Org Admin runbook for the Jenkins project]
* link:https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/oa-tips[Org Admin tips by Google]

== Contacts

* We use the link:/sigs/gsoc[GSoC SIG] for communications about GSoC.
Projects may also have their own mailing lists, chats, and meetings.
Please take a look at the details on each of the project pages.
* We use link:https://community.jenkins.io/c/contributing/gsoc/6[Discourse] for discussions.
  This is the **recommended** channel for communications.
* There is also a link:https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#jenkinsci_gsoc-sig:gitter.im[GSoC Gitter channel] for real-time communications, but it is better to use Discourse to request technical feedback or to have long-form discussions.
* For private matters such as communication difficulties with mentors, GSoC contributors, or Org Admins,
  please use this mailto:gsoc-jenkins-org-admin@googlegroups.com[group email].

=== GSoC Discourse

Public communication channel: link:https://community.jenkins.io/c/contributing/gsoc/6[GSoC Discourse].

The purpose of GSoC Discourse is for all public communications on GSoC such as new mentor and new GSoC contributor introductions, project proposal questions and discussions, process and timeline related questions.

=== Chats

* link:https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#jenkinsci_gsoc-sig:gitter.im[GSoC Gitter channel] for organizational topics related to Jenkins in GSoC
* Project-specific chats, see project and project idea pages
* link:/chat/[Common developer chats] for technical topics

=== Office hours

Although we use Discourse as the main communication channel, we will have regular "office hours" video calls.
During these time slots Jenkins GSoC org admins and mentors are available for any GSoC-related questions.

// * Schedule: Weekly 30 minutes meetings. Office hours will be held on Thursdays at 13:00 UTC.
//   Use the link:/event-calendar[Jenkins event calendar] to view the meeting time in your own time zone.
// * link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UykfAHpPYtSx-r_PQIRikz2QUrX1SG-ySriz20rVmE0/edit?usp=sharing[Agenda]
// * Meetings are commonly recorded on-demand and posted link:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN7ajX_VdyaODwGnSZzxjV6-6mqRfcoBe[here].

// This meeting will be used for Q&A with GSoC applicants/contributors and mentors before the announcement of accepted projects as well as during the GSoC program.
// You can add the office hours to your calendar when you visit the link:/event-calendar[Jenkins event calendar].
// More slots may be added on-demand, e.g. for project-specific discussions.

In addition to these organization-wide meetings, each GSoC project will hold regular meetings during community bonding and coding phases.
// Please take a look at the project pages for the schedule.
