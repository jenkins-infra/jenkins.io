title: "IRC Bot"
---

:toc:

The primary Jenkins IRC Channel (`#jenkins` on the
link:http://freenode.net[Freenode]
network) uses an administrator bot "jenkins-admin" so that some of the project
operation work can be done by the community. This bot is available for anyone
in the channel with "voice", which is an IRC jargon for those users who are
trusted.

== Available actions


Actions should be addressed to the `jenkins-admin` bot as if you are speaking
directly to the robot.

=== IRC Management

*Grant voice to a user*

Any of the following variations will work for granting voice to a user named
`USER`:

[source]
----
jenkins-admin: Make USER voice
jenkins-admin: Give USER voice
jenkins-admin: Grant USER voice
jenkins-admin: Add USER voice
----

*Ungrant voice to a user*

Any of the following variations will work for removing voice from a user named
`USER`:

[source]
----
jenkins-admin: Remove USER voice
jenkins-admin: Delete USER voice
jenkins-admin: Ungrant USER voice
----

*Get help*

[source]
----
jenkins-admin: help
----

*Get the version of the bot*

[source]
----
jenkins-admin: version
----

*Kick a user*

Only should be used when dealing with spammers or otherwise highly abusive
participants to the IRC channel.

[source]
----
jenkins-admin: kick USER
----

=== GitHub Repo Management

The following actions are used for managing repositories in the
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci[jenkinsci organization]
on GitHub.

*Grant a committer access*

[source]
----
jenkins-admin: Make USER a committer
jenkins-admin: Give USER a commit access
jenkins-admin: Grant USER a commit access
----

Where USER is the GitHub user ID. This command adds the said user into the
Everyone team, which has access to all the plugins. Can be only invoked by
people with voice or channel-op access.

[source]
----
jenkins-admin: Make USER a committer of/to REPO
jenkins-admin: Give USER a commit access of/to REPO
jenkins-admin: Grant USER a commit access of/to REPO
----

This adds the user just to the specific repository. This reduces the amount of pull request related e-mails that the user gets, but this needs to be repeated for each repository.

*Fork an existing repository on GitHub*

[source]
----
jenkins-admin: Fork USER/REPO [on github]
jenkins-admin: Fork USER/REPO [on github] as NEW_REPO_NAME
jenkins-admin: Fork GITHUB_REPO_URL [on github] as NEW_REPO_NAME
----

This will fork a repository into Jenkins. The said user will be added as a
committer to all the Jenkins repositories.

By convention, plugin repositories in Jenkins has the "PLUGINID-plugin" name,
so please use the "as NEW_REPO_NAME" clause to adjust the repository name. A
prefix of "jenkins" or any other irrelevant information should be removed.

For example:

[source]
----
jenkins-admin: fork example/jenkins-foobar as foobar-plugin
jenkins-admin: fork https://github.com/somebody/foobar-plugin
----

*Create a new repository on GitHub*

[source]
----
jenkins-admin: Create REPO on github
jenkins-admin: Create REPO on github for SOMEONE
----


In the latter form, the specified someone will get the commit access to the
repository right away.


=== Issue Tracker Management


*Create an issue tracker component*

[source]
----
jenkins-admin: Create COMPONENT in the issue tracker for USER
jenkins-admin: Create COMPONENT in the bug database for USER
----

Where COMPONENT is the subcomponent name in the issue tracker (normally the
name of the plugin), and USER is the jenkins-ci.org user ID who gets the
initial notification when a new bug is filed.

*Set default assignee of issue tracker component*

[source]
----
jenkins-admin: Set USER as default assignee of COMPONENT
jenkins-admin: Make USER the lead of COMPONENT
----

Where COMPONENT is the subcomponent name in the issue tracker (normally the
name of the plugin), and USER is the jenkins-ci.org user ID who gets the
initial notification when a new bug is filed.

*Remove the default assignee*

[source]
----
jenkins-admin: Remove the default assignee of COMPONENT
jenkins-admin: Remove lead of COMPONENT
----

*Rename the component*

[source]
----
jenkins-admin: Rename component COMPONENT to NEW_NAME
----


*Modify the component description*

[source]
----
jenkins-admin: Set description of COMPONENT to "DESCRIPTION"
jenkins-admin: Set the description for component COMPONENT to "DESCRIPTION"
----

*Remove the component*

The command removes the specified component. All its issues will be moved to COMPONENT2

[source]
----
jenkins-admin: Remove component COMPONENT1 and move its issues to COMPONENT2
jenkins-admin: Delete component COMPONENT1 and move its issues to COMPONENT2
----
