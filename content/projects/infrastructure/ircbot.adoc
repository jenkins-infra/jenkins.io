:toc:

The primary Jenkins IRC Channel (`#jenkins` on the
link:https://libera.chat/[Libera Chat]
network) uses an administrator bot "jenkins-admin" so that some of the project
operation work can be done by the community. This bot is available for anyone
in the channel with "voice", which is an IRC jargon for those users who are
trusted.

== Available actions


Actions should be addressed to the `jenkins-admin` bot as if you are speaking
directly to the robot.

=== IRC Management

*Grant voice to a user*

Any of the following variations will work for granting voice to a user named
`USER`:

[source]
----

jenkins-admin: Add USER voice
----

*Ungrant voice to a user*

Any of the following variations will work for removing voice from a user named
`USER`:

[source]
----
jenkins-admin: Remove USER voice
jenkins-admin: Delete USER voice
jenkins-admin: Ungrant USER voice
----

*Get help*

[source]
----

----

*Get the version of the bot*

participants to the IRC channel.

=== GitHub Repo Management

The following actions are used for managing repositories in the
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci[jenkinsci organization]
on GitHub.

*Grant a committer access*

[source]
----
jenkins-admin: Make USER a committer of/to REPO1[, REPO2, REPO3...]
jenkins-admin: Give USER a commit access of/to REPO[, REPO2, REPO3...]
jenkins-admin: Grant USER a commit access of/to REPO[, REPO2, REPO3...]
----

This adds the user to the per-repo team in the specified repositories, typically granting admin access. One or more repository may be listed by separating them with commas.

*Grant maintainer access to a team*

[source]
----
jenkins-admin: Make USER a maintainer on TEAM1[, TEAM2, TEAM3...]
jenkins-admin: Give USER a maintainer on TEAM1[, TEAM2, TEAM3...]
jenkins-admin: Grant USER a maintainer on TEAM1[, TEAM2, TEAM3...]
----

For example:
[source]
----
jenkins-admin: Make some-user a maintainer on blueocean-plugin Developers, figlet-buildstep-plgin Developers
----

This adds the user to the specified team(s) with the maintainer role. One or more team may be listed by separating with commas.

*Remove a user from a team*

[source]
----
jenkins-admin: Remove USER as committer on TEAM1[, TEAM2, TEAM3...]
jenkins-admin: Remove USER as member on TEAM1[, TEAM2, TEAM3...]
----

This removes the user from the teams associated with the repositories listed. 
One or more repositories may be listed by separating them with commas.

*Make team visible*

[source]
----
jenkins-admin: Make TEAM1[, TEAM2, TEAM3...] teams visible
----

This makes the specified teams 'visible' (still requires organisation membership to see it),
which makes the team show up in reviewers when using CODEOWNERS, and allows non members of the teams
to mention them. One or more team may be listed by separating them with commas.

*Fork an existing repository on GitHub*

[source]
----
jenkins-admin: Fork USER/REPO [on github]
jenkins-admin: Fork USER/REPO [on github] as NEW_REPO_NAME
jenkins-admin: Fork GITHUB_REPO_URL [on github] as NEW_REPO_NAME
----

This will fork a repository into Jenkins. The said user will be added as a
committer to all the Jenkins repositories.

By convention, plugin repositories in Jenkins has the "PLUGINID-plugin" name,
so please use the "as NEW_REPO_NAME" clause to adjust the repository name. A
prefix of "jenkins" or any other irrelevant information should be removed.

For example:

[source]
----
jenkins-admin: fork example/jenkins-foobar as foobar-plugin
jenkins-admin: fork https://github.com/somebody/foobar-plugin
----

*Create a new repository on GitHub*

[source]
----
jenkins-admin: Create REPO on github
jenkins-admin: Create REPO on github for SOMEONE
----


In the latter form, the specified someone will get the commit access to the
repository right away.


=== Issue Tracker Management


*Create an issue tracker component*

[source]
----
jenkins-admin: Create COMPONENT in the issue tracker for USER
jenkins-admin: Create COMPONENT in the bug database for USER
----

Where COMPONENT is the subcomponent name in the issue tracker (normally the
name of the plugin), and USER is the jenkins-ci.org user ID who gets the
initial notification when a new bug is filed.

*Set default assignee of issue tracker component*

[source]
----
jenkins-admin: Set USER as default assignee of COMPONENT1[, COMPONENT2, COMPONENT3...]
jenkins-admin: Make USER the lead of COMPONENT1[, COMPONENT2, COMPONENT3...]
----

Where COMPONENTx is the subcomponent name in the issue tracker (normally the
name of the plugin), and USER is the jenkins-ci.org user ID who gets the
initial notification when a new bug is filed. One or more components can be
listed by separating them with commas.

*Remove the default assignee*
