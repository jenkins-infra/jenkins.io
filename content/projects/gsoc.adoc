The link:https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/[Google Summer of Code]
(GSoC) project is an annual, international, program which encourages
college-aged students to participate with open source projects during the summer
break between classes. Students accepted into the program receive a stipend,
paid by Google, to work well-defined projects to improve or enhance the Jenkins
project.  In exchange, numerous Jenkins community members volunteer as "mentors"
for students to help integrate them into the open source community and succeed
in completing their summer projects.

== 2016 Student Projects

The Jenkins project is participating in the Google Summer of Code 2016 with

student projects].


=== Support-core plugin improvements

The objective of this project is to make improvements for support-core plugin by
implementing the following three features and functionalities which have been
requested in issue tracker. JENKINS-33090 JENKINS-33091 JENKINS-21670

=== Automatic Plugin Documentation Publishing

Currently Jenkins has plugin documentation is being stored in Confluence.
Sometimes the documentation is scattered and outdated. In order to improve the
situation we would like to follow the documentation-as-code approach and to put
docs to plugin repositories and then publish them on the project website using
the awestruct engine. The project aims an implementation of a documentation
continuous deployment flow powered by Jenkins and Pipeline Plugin.

=== External Workspace Manager Plugin

link:https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/external-workspace-manager-plugin?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link[image:https://badges.gitter.im/jenkinsci/external-workspace-manager-plugin.svg[title: "Gitter"]]

Currently, Jenkinsâ€™ build workspace may become very large in size due to the
fact that some compilers generate very large volumes of data. The existing
plugins that share the workspace across builds are able to do this by copying
the files from one workspace to another, process which is inefficient.

A solution for this problem is to create the
link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/external-workspace-manager-plugin[External
Workspace Manager Plugin]. The plugin should:

* provide an external workspace management system
* facilitate workspace share and reuse across multiple Jenkins jobs
* eliminate the need to copy, archive or move files

Additional details about the plugin may be found on the
link:/blog/2016/05/23/external-workspace-manager-plugin/[blog post] introduction.

===== Meetings

We are having meetings **twice a week** regarding the External Workspace Manager Plugin.
We usually discuss progress, solve possible blockers and set-up a plan for the next days.
If you are interested in this subject, you have questions about the plugin,
or you want to come up with any suggestions, feel free to join us.
The meetings are taking place on the link:/hangout[Jenkins hangout],
**every Monday** at
link:http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=External+Workspace+Manager+Plugin+(Mondays+weekly+recurring)&iso=20160606T12&p1=1440&ah=1[12 PM UTC]
and **every Thursday** at

=== Jenkins 2.0 Web Interface Improvements: New Job Creation and Configuration

Although powerful, Jenkins new job creation and configuration process may be non
obvious and time consuming. This can be improved by making UI more intuitive,
concise, and functional. I plan to achieve this by creating a simpler new job
creation, configuration process focused on essential elements, and embedding new
functionality.

=== Jenkins Usage Statistics Analysis

Jenkins is a powerful application that allows continuous integration and
delivery of products. It has collected anonymous usage informations of more than
100,000 installations. Our goal is to perform various analysis and studies over
this dataset to discover trend in resource utilisation for example plugins
utilisation, spotting downgrades etc. This project covers a wide range of high
priority problems which need to be solved. Problem such as how quickly users are
upgrading Jenkins and its plugin, will give us the insight of popularity &
unpopularity of the releases. Spotting downgrades will warn that something is
wrong with the version. Correlating what users are saying(community rating) with
what users are doing (upgrades/downgrades). Finding set of the plugins which are
most likely to be used together will setup the pillars for development of plugin
recommendation system. These were the few set of the problems that will give
better insights of Jenkins utilization with some of the basic data mining
studies like latest trend in the installation size, pie charts for platforms in
use and ranking the users.
