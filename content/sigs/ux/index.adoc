== Projects

The special interest group drives a number of initiatives within the link:/project/roadmap/[Jenkins roadmap].

[[project-ui-look-and-feel]]
=== UI/UX: Jenkins Look and Feel updates

The first UX SIG project is revamping the Jenkins UI look and feel.
The initial focus will be on CSS changes and key Jenkins components: header, footer, side panels, etc.
Once this project has been completed, a more thorough rewrite of the Jenkins UI will be planned.  

See the jira:JENKINS-60919[] EPIC for more details about the scope.

[[project-ui-accessibility]]
=== UI/UX: Accessibility

We would like to make Jenkins usable by as many people as possible.
It includes multiple groups of users: people with disabilities, ones using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.
In general, all Jenkins users would benefit from better navigation and layouts.

See the jira:JENKINS-62268[] EPIC for more details about the scope.

Future project which targets a major redesign of the Jenkins user interface. 

Goals:

* Define Long Term Architecture for the Jenkins frontend
* Overhaul of the user interface to provide better user experience to end users and administrators
