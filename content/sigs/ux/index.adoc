overview: >
  The User Experience SIG focuses on improving the Jenkins' user interface and user experience.
  The SIG seeks regular feedback from the community on the current UI and UX and new designs proposed by SIG members and others.
  We will discuss alternatives, identify compromises, and test implementations to improve the Jenkins UI / UX.

An overview of the Jenkins UX SIG documentation can be found by following this link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J3HsxYdNPDZpFzCz6HWGcIhsY3urOXOZmiMiGR1D-ew/edit?usp=sharing[link].

== Topics
* Reviewing new UI proposals

[[ongoing-projects]]
== Projects

The special interest group drives a number of initiatives within the link:/project/roadmap/[Jenkins roadmap].

[[project-ui-look-and-feel]]
=== UI/UX: Jenkins Look and Feel updates

The first UX SIG project is revamping the Jenkins UI look and feel.
The initial focus will be on CSS changes and key Jenkins components: header, footer, side panels, etc.
Once this project has been completed, a more thorough rewrite of the Jenkins UI will be planned.  

See the jira:JENKINS-60919[] EPIC for more details about the scope.

[[project-ui-accessibility]]
=== UI/UX: Accessibility

We would like to make Jenkins usable by as many people as possible.
It includes multiple groups of users: people with disabilities, ones using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.
In general, all Jenkins users would benefit from better navigation and layouts.

See the jira:JENKINS-62268[] EPIC for more details about the scope.

[[project-plugin-management-ui-ux]]
=== Plugin management UI improvements

This project aims to improve link:/doc/book/managing/plugins/[plugin management UI] user experience for Jenkins administrators so that they can easily discover plugins and make decisions about plugin upgrades.
Scope: Plugin Manager in the Jenkins core,
link:http://plugins.jenkins.io/[plugins.jenkins.io],
link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/update-center2[Jenkins Update Center] and other services.
For non-UI plugin management, see the link:/sigs/platform/#plugin-management[Platform SIG initiatives].

Goals:

* Improve search, listing and categorization of plugins to help users to discover plugins they need. 
* Provide more information about plugins in the UI
* Help admins to make educated decisions about updating plugins by showing info about new versions: changelogs, reported issues, community ratings, security warnings, etc.

This project might extend the Jenkins Update Center API and data structure to provide more information required for UI.
Jenkins core logic will remain compatible with old update center APIs,
but alternate update centers might need an update to give users access to the new features.

Opportunities for contribution:

* jira:WEBSITE-637[Plugin Site Update: Documentation and Changelogs from GitHub]
* https://issues.jenkins.io/issues/?jql=component%20%3D%20core%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20plugin-manager%20and%20labels%20in%20(ux%2C%20ux-sig%2C%20ui%2C%20accessibility%2C%20user-experience)%20and%20resolution%20is%20empty[Plugin Manager UI/UX issues in Jenkins Jira]

[[project-ui-overhaul]]
=== Jenkins user interface overhaul

Future project which targets a major redesign of the Jenkins user interface. 

Goals:

* Define Long Term Architecture for the Jenkins frontend
* Overhaul of the user interface to provide better user experience to end users and administrators
