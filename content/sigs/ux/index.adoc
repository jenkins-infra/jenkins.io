overview: >
  The User Experience SIG focuses on improving the Jenkins' user interface and user experience.
  The SIG seeks regular feedback from the community on the current UI and UX and new designs proposed by SIG members and others.
  We will discuss alternatives, identify compromises, and test implementations to improve the Jenkins UI / UX.

== Projects

The special interest group drives a number of initiatives within the link:/project/roadmap/[Jenkins roadmap].
Here are the most important ones:

[[project-ui-look-and-feel]]
=== UI/UX: Jenkins Look and Feel updates

One UX SIG project is revamping the Jenkins UI look and feel.
This is an ongoing effort, new features will be integrated step by step into the Jenkins weekly releases.

[[project-ui-accessibility]]
=== UI/UX: Accessibility

We would like to make Jenkins usable by as many people as possible.
It includes multiple groups of users: people with disabilities, ones using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.
In general, all Jenkins users would benefit from better navigation and layouts.

See the jira:JENKINS-62268[] EPIC for more details about the scope.

== Meetings
We have regular meetings on Wednesday every four weeks, at *4PM UTC*.
See the link:/event-calendar[Jenkins Event Calendar] for the schedule.
At these meetings we discuss projects, share presentations, and demonstrate new capabilities.
Meetings are conducted and recorded using Zoom and are archived to the link:https://www.youtube.com/user/jenkinsci[Jenkins YouTube channel] in the link:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN7ajX_VdyaOnsIIsZHsv_fM9QhOcajWe[Jenkins UX SIG YouTube playlist].
