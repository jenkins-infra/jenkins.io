* Usage of EDA Tools in Jenkins
* ASIC and FPGA RDF flows with Jenkins
* Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing on Jenkins
* Jenkins plugins for the area
* Coordinating development projects related to the area
  (e.g. link:/projects/gsoc[Google Summer of Code] projects)

=== Meetings

SIG meetings will be held on a monthly basis.
