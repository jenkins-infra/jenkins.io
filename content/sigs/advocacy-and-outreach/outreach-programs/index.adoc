This page list the current community programs, and the programs we're interested in.

== Current Programs

The Jenkins community participates in the following programs:

=== Google Summer of Code

image:/images/gsoc/jenkins-gsoc-logo_small.png[Jenkins GSoC, role=center, float=right]

link:https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/[Google Summer of Code]
(GSoC) is an annual, international, program which encourages
college-aged students to participate with open source projects during the summer
break between classes.

Students accepted into the program receive a stipend,
paid by Google, to work well-defined projects to improve or enhance the Jenkins project.
In exchange, numerous Jenkins community members volunteer as "mentors"
for students to help integrate them into the open source community and succeed
in completing their summer projects.

For more information, see link:/projects/gsoc/[our GSoC project page].

To contact us regarding this program,
send us a message on the
link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jenkinsci-gsoc-all-public[GSoC mailing list]
or contact us on the
link:https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/gsoc-sig[GSoC Gitter channel].

is a month long celebration of open source software.
Its mission is to give back to the open source community.

See the link:/events/hacktoberfest[our Hacktoberfest page] for more information.

=== Community Bridge

In 2019 we have started evaluation of the link:https://communitybridge.org/[Community Bridge] portal
provided by link:https://www.linuxfoundation.org/[Linux Foundation].
This website provides ways to run internship programs and to fund them,
and we would like to use it to run projects outside of the Google Summer of Code timeframe.
You can find the Jenkins project page link:https://people.communitybridge.org/project/bce45251-1ff4-4131-9699-0a0017b31495[here].

Our first project on Community Bridge is link:/projects/jcasc/dev-tools/[Developer Tools for Jenkins Configuration-as-Code] (Aug-Nov 2019).
We are interested in onboarding more projects, and we invite Jenkins contributors and potential metnees to reach out to us.

=== Google Season of Docs

The https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/[Google Season of Docs]
program brings together open source and technical writers communities for the benefit of both.
The program raises awareness of open source, of docs, and of technical writing.

The Jenkins organization was accepted to Google Season of Docs in 2020.
The link:/sigs/docs/gsod/2020/projects/document-jenkins-on-kubernetes/[Jenkins on Kubernetes project] created an installation guide for Jenkins on Kubernetes.
See the link:/blog/2020/12/04/gsod-project-report/[project report] by link:/blog/authors/zaycodes[Zainab Abubakar] for details of the 2020 project.
We look forward to additional Jenkins project opportunities with Google Season of Docs.

Please see the link:/sigs/docs/gsod[documentation SIG] page for more information and contacts.

=== She Code Africa Contributhon

The https://sites.google.com/shecodeafrica.org/contributhon/home/guide/[She Code Africa Contributhon] 
 is a boot camp where African women are paid to work with open source organizations on selected projects with dedicated mentors.
 This program aims to create a more diverse, inclusive, and innovative culture within the African open source ecosystem by matching African women in technology with sponsor and mentor open source organizations.
