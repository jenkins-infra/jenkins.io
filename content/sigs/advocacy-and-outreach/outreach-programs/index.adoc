This page list the current community programs, and the programs we're interested in.

== Current Programs

The Jenkins community participates in the following programs:

=== Google Summer of Code

image:/images/gsoc/jenkins-gsoc-logo_small.png[Jenkins GSoC, role=center, float=right]

link:https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/[Google Summer of Code]
(GSoC) is an annual, international, program which encourages
college-aged students to participate with open source projects during the summer
break between classes.

Students accepted into the program receive a stipend,
paid by Google, to work well-defined projects to improve or enhance the Jenkins project.
In exchange, numerous Jenkins community members volunteer as "mentors"
for students to help integrate them into the open source community and succeed
in completing their summer projects.

For more information, see link:/projects/gsoc/[our GSoC project page].

To contact us regarding this program,
send us a message on the
link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jenkinsci-gsoc-all-public[GSoC mailing list]
or contact us on the
link:https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/gsoc-sig[GSoC Gitter channel].

is a month long celebration of open source software.
Its mission is to give back to the open source community.

=== Community Bridge

In 2019 we have started evaluation of the link:https://communitybridge.org/[Community Bridge] portal 
provided by link:https://www.linuxfoundation.org/[Linux Foundation].
This website provides ways to run internship programs and to fund them,
and we would like to use it to run projects outside of the Google Summer of Code timeframe.
You can find the Jenkins project page link:https://people.communitybridge.org/project/bce45251-1ff4-4131-9699-0a0017b31495[here].

Our first project on Community Bridge is link:/projects/jcasc/dev-tools/[Developer Tools for Jenkins Configuration-as-Code] (Aug-Nov 2019).
We are interested in onboarding more projects, and we invite Jenkins contributors and potential metnees to reach out to us.

To contact us regarding this program, send us a message on the

=== Google Season of Docs

The https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/[Google Season of Doc]
program brings together open source and technical writers communities for the benefit of both.
The program raises awareness of open source, of docs, and of technical writing.

The Jenkins organization would like to participate in this program, but we have not yet been accepted.

Please see the
link:/sigs/docs[documentation SIG] page
for contact information, and let us know if you'd like to help us participate in this program.
