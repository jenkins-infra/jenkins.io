This page lists the current community programs, and the programs we're interested in.

== Current Programs

The Jenkins community participates in the following programs:

=== Google Summer of Code

link:https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/[Google Summer of Code]
(GSoC) is an annual, international, program which encourages
college-aged students to participate with open source projects during the summer
break between classes.

Students accepted into the program receive a stipend,
paid by Google, to work on well-defined projects to improve or enhance the Jenkins project.
In exchange, numerous Jenkins community members volunteer as "mentors"
for students to help integrate them into the open source community and succeed
in completing their summer projects.

For more information, see link:/projects/gsoc/[our GSoC project page].
