=== Online Meetup

Our SIG manages the link:/events/online-meetup[Jenkins Online Meetup platform] and helps to organize events on this platform.
It includes user-focused and contributor-focused events.
See the linked page for more information.

=== Local Events

Our SIG is interested to help with organizing and promoting local events which focus on Jenkins or have a substantial representation of Jenkins in their agenda.
These meetups are not limited to link:/projects/jam[Jenkins Area Meetups] or link:/projects/jam[CI/CD Meetups],
we are interested to help any other meetup group or entities organizing local meetups and conferences related to Jenkins.

The SIG does not manage meetup operations (creating new meetups, delivering swag, etc.),
but we are ready to help to find proper channels if needed.
link:/projects/jam[This page] summarizes the current state of meetup operations.

=== Social media

Our SIG coordinates Jenkins promotion in social media and other channels,
including but not limited to link:https://twitter.com/jenkinsci[Twitter], link:https://www.youtube.com/user/jenkinsci/[YouTube] and link:https://www.linkedin.com/company/jenkins-project/[LinkedIn].
If you would like to share any content about Jenkins on these platforms,
please contact us and we will try to help.
