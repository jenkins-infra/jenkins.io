The special interest group offers a venue for all kinds of platform support discussions:
Java, Operating Systems, Architectures, Docker, Packaging, Web Containers, etc.

The group focuses on technologies used in Jenkins:

* Java Virtual Machines: versions, compatibility and optmizations
* Operating Systems: native components, packaging
* Architectures and platforms
* Web Containers

Platform SIG may be cooperating with other groups.
For example, we will be cooperating with the link:/sigs/cloud-native[Cloud-Native Jenkins group]
if the topics related to Cloud-Native platforms like Kubernetes or Docker.

=== Topics

* Defining platform support policies (e.g. “defining Windows support policy”)
* Coordinating effort on new platform support (e.g. Java 10 in JEP-TODO)
* Working with external communities on better platform support and packaging
(e.g. improving support of IBM Java, enabling OpenIndiana packaging,
ARM Support in Jenkins, adapting RedHat packaging to best practices, etc.)
* Reviewing JEPs submitted in the area

=== Meetings

There will be regular SIG meetings scheduled.
Initially the meetings will be conducted once per month,
then they may be adapted according to the activity.

Meetings will be conducted and recorded via Jenkins Hangouts-on-Air.
Participant links will be posted in the SIG Gitter Chat within 10 minutes before the meeting starts.

==== 2018-08-23. Eclipse OpenJ9 and Jenkins

This online meetup is about Eclipse OpenJ9 and Jenkins.
The discussion will be led by Steve Poole (Eclipse Openj9), and Tracy Miranda where they aim to shed light on some questions.
Can Jenkins stand to gain any performance boosts by taking advantage of Eclipse OpenJ9 and its optimizations?
How can the two open source communities collaborate to drive improvements for Jenkins running in the cloud?
