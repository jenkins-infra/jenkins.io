The special interest group offers a venue for all kinds of platform support discussions:
Java, Operating Systems, Architectures, Docker, Packaging, Web Containers, etc.

The group focuses on technologies used in Jenkins:

* Java Virtual Machines: versions, compatibility and optmizations
* Operating Systems: native components, packaging
* Architectures and platforms
* Web Containers

Platform SIG may be cooperating with other groups.
For example, we will be cooperating with the link:/sigs/cloud-native[Cloud-Native Jenkins group]
on topics related to Cloud-Native platforms like Kubernetes or Docker.

=== Topics

* Defining platform support policies (e.g. “defining Windows support policy”)
* Coordinating effort on new platform support (e.g. jep:211[Java 11 Support in Jenkins])
* Working with external communities on better platform support and packaging
(e.g. improving support of IBM Java, enabling OpenIndiana packaging,
ARM architecture support, adapting RedHat packaging to best practices, etc.)
* Reviewing JEPs submitted in the area

=== Ongoing projects

* Multi-architecture Docker images
** Enabling official images to run on Arm, IBM s390x, and other platforms
* Rework of Windows installers
** New version of installers for 64bit platforms
** Removal of Java bundling
** Creating an official link:https://chocolatey.org/packages/jenkins[Jenkins Chocolatey package]
* Enabling continuous delivery for Jenkins packaging
** Experimental DockerHub organization and deployments from ci.jenkins.io (jep:217[])
