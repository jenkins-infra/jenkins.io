  The SIG works on defining platform support policies,
  coordinating platform support efforts with contributors and external communities,
  and reviewing proposals in the area.

The special interest group offers a venue for all kinds of platform support discussions:
Java, Operating Systems, Architectures, Docker, Packaging, Web Containers, etc.

The group focuses on technologies used in Jenkins:

* Java Virtual Machines: versions, compatibility and optimizations
* Operating Systems: native components, packaging
* Architectures and platforms
* Web Containers

Platform SIG cooperates with other groups like the link:/sigs/docs/[Documentation SIG].

== Topics

* Defining platform support policies, including
** link:/doc/book/platform-information/support-policy-java/[Java support policy]
** link:/doc/book/platform-information/support-policy-linux/[Linux support policy]
** link:/doc/book/platform-information/support-policy-windows/[Windows support policy]
** link:/doc/book/platform-information/support-policy-web-browsers/[Browser support policy]
** link:https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/platform-information/support-policy-servlet-containers/[Servlet container support policy]
* Coordinating effort on new platform support (like RISC-V)
* Working with external communities on better platform support and packaging
(e.g. ARM architecture support, adapting Red Hat packaging to best practices, using systemd, etc.)
* Reviewing JEPs submitted in the area

== Projects

This section lists the key initiatives being handled by the Platform SIG.
See the link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bDfUdtjpwoX0HO2PRnfqns_TROBOK8tmP6SgVhubr2Y/edit?usp=sharing[SIG meeting notes] for more information about the ongoing projects.
See the link:/project/roadmap[Jenkins Project roadmap] for a

=== Docker images

Jenkins project ships official controller and agent images,
and we would like to offer wide support of platforms and architectures there.
Scope of interest:

* Enabling official images to run on Arm, IBM s390x, and other platforms
* Official controller and agent images for Windows
* Support multi-architecture Docker images
* Enabling continuous delivery for Jenkins packaging
** Experimental DockerHub organization and deployments from ci.jenkins.io (jep:217[])

=== Plugin management

We are interested to improve plugin management experience in Jenkins.
To do that, we work on new tools for Jenkins users and maintainers.
Scope of interest:

* link:/doc/book/managing/plugins/[Plugin management in Jenkins Web UI]
* link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/docker#preinstalling-plugins[Plugin management in Jenkins Docker images]
* link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/plugin-installation-manager-tool[Plugin Installation Manager CLI Tool]
* link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/bom[Bill of Materials for Jenkins plugins]

=== Java support

In our SIG we are interested to offer a wide range of supported JVMs.
See the current list of supported versions link:/doc/book/platform-information/support-policy-java/[here].

Scope of interest:

* Maintaining Java 17 and Java 21 support in Jenkins and driving adoption of new Java versions
* Migration to link:https://adoptium.net/[Eclipse Temurin] in Docker images
* Support for future mainstream JVM versions (Java 25, ...)
* Support for perspective virtual machines like link:https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM] or link:https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus], including native executable packaging

=== Windows support

Many Jenkins users run controller or agents on Windows.
We are interested to support modern Windows platforms and to offer official distributions for the platform.

Scope of interest:

* link:/doc/book/platform-information/support-policy-windows/[Windows support policy]
* Native Windows installers (MSI), including the ongoing link:/blog/2019/02/01/windows-installers/[rework of Windows installers]
* Official Docker images for Windows controllers and agents
* Installation of controllers and agents as Windows services
* Official link:https://chocolatey.org/packages/jenkins[Jenkins Chocolatey package]

== Meetings

We have regular meetings on Tuesday every two weeks, at *17:00 UTC*.
See the link:/event-calendar/[Jenkins Event Calendar] for the schedule.
At these meetings we discuss projects, share presentations, and demonstrate new capabilities.
Meetings are conducted and recorded via Zoom and archived to the link:https://www.youtube.com/user/jenkinsci[Jenkins YouTube channel] in the link:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN7ajX_VdyaO3VROIfVsobTciEkLnVtSM[Platform SIG play list].
Participant links are posted in the link:https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#jenkinsci_platform-sig:gitter.im[SIG Gitter Chat] 10 minutes before the meeting starts.
