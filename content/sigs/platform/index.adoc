  The SIG works on defining platform support policies,
  coordinating platform support efforts with contributors and external communities,
  and reviewing proposals in the area.
---

The special interest group offers a venue for all kinds of platform support discussions:
Java, Operating Systems, Architectures, Docker, Packaging, Web Containers, etc.

The group focuses on technologies used in Jenkins:

* Java Virtual Machines: versions, compatibility and optmizations
* Operating Systems: native components, packaging
* Architectures and platforms
* Web Containers

Platform SIG may be cooperating with other groups.
For example, we will be cooperating with the link:/sigs/cloud-native[Cloud-Native Jenkins group]
if the topics related to Cloud-Native platforms like Kubernetes or Docker.

=== Topics

* Defining platform support policies (e.g. “defining Windows support policy”)
* Coordinating effort on new platform support (e.g. jep:211[Java 11 Support in Jenkins])
* Working with external communities on better platform support and packaging
(e.g. improving support of IBM Java, enabling OpenIndiana packaging,
ARM architecture support, adapting RedHat packaging to best practices, etc.)
* Reviewing JEPs submitted in the area

=== Ongoing projects

* Java 11 support in Jenkins (jep:211[])
* Multi-architecture Docker images
** Enabling official images to run on Arm, IBM s390x, and other platforms
* Rework of Windows installers
** New version of installers for 64bit platforms
** Removal of Java bundling
** Creating an official link:https://chocolatey.org/packages/jenkins[Jenkins Chocolatey package]
* Enabling continuous delivery for Jenkins packaging
** Experimental DockerHub organization and deployments from ci.jenkins.io (jep:217[])

==== 2018-08-23. Eclipse OpenJ9 and Jenkins

This online meetup is about Eclipse OpenJ9 and Jenkins.
The discussion will be led by Steve Poole (Eclipse Openj9), and Tracy Miranda where they aim to shed light on some questions.
Can Jenkins stand to gain any performance boosts by taking advantage of Eclipse OpenJ9 and its optimizations?
How can the two open source communities collaborate to drive improvements for Jenkins running in the cloud?
