The https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/[Google Season of Docs (GSoD)]
program brings together open source and technical writers communities for the benefit of both.
The program raises awareness of open source, of docs, and of technical writing.
GSoD in Jenkins is organized by the link:/sigs/docs[Documentation special interest group].

== GSoD 2020

Jenkins project will be a mentoring organization in Google Season of Docs 2020.
We invite technical writers to join the community and contribute to the documentation being used by millions of Jenkins users worldwide.

=== Project ideas

We invite technical writers to contribute to a major documentation update effort being coordinated in the documentation SIG.
It includes a number of link:/sigs/docs/#ongoing-projects[ongoing projects],
and technical writers are welcome to make their proposals in any area of the Jenkins documentation.
We encourage proposals based on a technical writer's expertise and interests.

|Project idea | Keywords | Description and links

| Plugin documentation migration and update 
| Markdown, GitHub, Plugins, Rewrite, Copy-editing
| Currently we are migrating our plugin documentation from link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/[Confluence] to GitHub,
  see link:/blog/2019/10/21/plugin-docs-on-github/[this blog post] for announcement.
  We have already moved hundreds of pages, but there are more than 1000 pages remaining.
  Migration itself can be done with automated tools we provide, but the documentation usually needs a significant update due to new features.
  We invite technical writers to select an area (e.g. "plugins for Docker"), and work closely with plugin maintainers to migrate and update documentation in such an area.
  link:/sigs/docs/#plugin-documentation-on-github[More Info]

| Document Jenkins on Kubernetes
| AsciiDoc, Guide, Compilation, Kubernetes
| Jenkins on Kubernetes is a popular theme for Jenkins users.
  There were a lot of presentations and articles about running Jenkins on Kubernetes, but we need a central location for documentation describing Jenkins on Kubernetes.
  We would like to create new documentation which would describe the concepts, techniques, and choices for Kubernetes users running Jenkins.
  link:/sigs/docs/#jenkins-on-kubernetes[More Info]

| Jenkins user documentation reorganization and update
| AsciiDoc, Guide, Rewrite
| Jenkins user topics are included in the current link:/doc/book[Jenkins Handbook], and are frequently received to improve the user documentation.
Common improvement themes include adding pipeline examples with each of the pipeline steps and additional tutorials for new users.
The main aim of this project would be to  restructure content to make it more discoverable and easy to read.
link:/sigs/docs/#user-guide[More info]

| Create new solution pages for Jenkins use-cases
| AsciiDoc, Guide
| Jenkins project has several link:/solutions/[solution pages] for various use-cases.
  We invite technical writers to create new solution pages for various use-cases (e.g. Documentation as code, Continuous Deployment, Static Analysis)
  or technologies (Git, Gitlab, Kubernetes, etc.).
  Existing pages were created several years ago, and they could be also updated.
  There are a lot of materials available on the web, but having dedicated solution pages could help users to discover such materials.

=== Technology and tools

For all new documentation projects we are using the link:https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/[Documentation as Code approach]
when documentation is developed using markup languages and stored in source control management (SCM) systems.
Here are the common tools we use:

* Markdown languages: link:https://asciidoctor.org/[AsciiDoc] and link:https://github.github.com/gfm/[GitHub Flavored Markdown]
** For example, this page is written in Asciidoc.
   You can find its sources link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/blob/master/content/sigs/docs/gsod/index.adoc[here].
* SCM: link:https://git-scm.com/[Git]
* Source Code Hosting: link:http://github.com/[github.com]
* Text editing: any text editor with AsciiDoc/Markdown support (e.g. link:https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code], link:https://notepad-plus-plus.org/[Notepad++]) or a specialized IDE 

Particular components may also require additional tools for documentation development.
For example, the jenkins.io website requires Docker for being built and tested locally.
In such cases we document usage of these tools in link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc[our contributing guidelines] and help newcomer maintainers if needed.

== Contacts

We will be using the link:/sigs/docs[Documentation SIG] communication channels for GSoD project discussions during the application phases.

* link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jenkinsci-docs[Mailing list]
* link:https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/docs[Gitter Channel]
* link:/sigs/docs/#meetings[Regular SIG meetings]

Once the projects are announced, other project-specific channels might be created by teams during the community bonding.
