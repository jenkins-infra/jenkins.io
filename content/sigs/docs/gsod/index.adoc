The https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/[Google Season of Docs (GSoD)]
program brings together open source and technical writers communities for the benefit of both.
The program raises awareness of open source, of docs, and of technical writing.
GSoD in Jenkins is organized by the link:/sigs/docs[Documentation special interest group].

== Technology and tools

For all new documentation projects we are using the link:https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/[Documentation as Code approach]
when documentation is developed using markup languages and stored in source control management (SCM) systems.
Here are the common tools we use:

* Markdown languages: link:https://asciidoctor.org/[AsciiDoc] and link:https://github.github.com/gfm/[GitHub Flavored Markdown]
** For example, this page is written in Asciidoc.
   You can find its sources link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/blob/master/content/sigs/docs/gsod/index.adoc[here].
* SCM: link:https://git-scm.com/[Git]
* Source Code Hosting: link:http://github.com/[github.com]
* Text editing: any text editor with AsciiDoc/Markdown support (e.g. link:https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code], link:https://notepad-plus-plus.org/[Notepad++]) or a specialized IDE

Particular components may also require additional tools for documentation development.
For example, the jenkins.io website requires Docker for being built and tested locally.
In such cases we document usage of these tools in link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc[our contributing guidelines] and help newcomer maintainers if needed.

== Contacts

We use the link:/sigs/docs[Documentation SIG] communication channels for GSoD project discussions during the application phases.

* link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jenkinsci-docs[Mailing list]
* link:https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/docs[Gitter Channel]
* link:/sigs/docs/#meetings[Regular SIG meetings]

Once the projects are announced, other project-specific channels may be created as needed.
