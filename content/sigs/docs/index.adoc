overview: >
  This special interest group improves Jenkins use and adoption through documentation.
  The SIG encourages, creates, and reviews documentation contributions and improves documentation with contributors and external communities.
---

The SIG offers a venue for all kinds of documentation creation, improvement, and delivery.

The group focuses on documentation for Jenkins and Jenkins X, including:

* link:/doc/[User documentation] - Using Jenkins
** link:/doc/tutorials[Tutorials]
** link:/doc/book/[User Handbook]
** References like link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/[Pipeline Syntax] and link:/doc/pipeline/steps/[Pipeline Steps]
** How-to Guides
* link:/doc/developer/[Extension documentation] - Extending Jenkins
** link:/doc/developer/tutorial/[Tutorials]
** link:/doc/developer/book/[Developer Reference]
** link:/doc/developer/guides/[How-To Guides]
* Solution documentation - Specific Solutions with Jenkins
** Language solutions like link:/solutions/c/[C/C++], link:/solutions/java/[Java], link:/solutions/php/[PHP], link:/solutions/python/[Python], and link:/solutions/c/[Ruby]
** Platform solutions like link:/solutions/android/[Android], link:/solutions/docker[Docker], and link:/solutions/embedded[Embedded]
** Implementation solutions like link:/solutions/pipeline[Pipeline]

Documentation SIG may cooperate with other groups.
For example, we will be cooperating with the link:/sigs/cloud-native[Cloud-Native Jenkins SIG]
on topics related to Cloud-Native documentation efforts and
with the link:/sigs/platform[Platform SIG].
on platform topics.

=== Topics

* Creating new documentation
* Improving existing documentation
* Reviewing documentation contributions
* Coordinating documentation initiatives
* Reviewing Jenkins Enhancement Proposals (JEPs) related to documentation

==== Plugin site integration with GitHub

link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/[Jenkins Plugin Site] currently uses Jenkins update center and link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/[Jenkins Wiki] as a main source of information to be displayed on the website.
We have recently added support of plugin documentation from GitHub (link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/VSdfVMDIW-A[announcement]), 
but there are still many improvement areas: visualizing changelogs, pulling plugin tags and maintainers list from GitHub, etc.
This project is tracked in the jira:WEBSITE-637[] EPIC.

==== Plugin documentation on GitHub

Currently the SIG is migrating plugin documentation from https://wiki.jenkins.io/ to GitHub.
Documentation in the plugin GitHub repository provides a good user experience for Jenkins users seeking documentation. 
At the same time, plugin maintainers now can follow the documentation-as-code approach and make documentation changes a part of the pull requests. 
It also gives an opportunity to review the documentation changes and to add documentation contributor recognition, 
especially if the story is combined with link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/.github/blob/master/.github/release-drafter.adoc[changelog automation]. 

We have more than 50 plugins which already use GitHub as a documentation source,
but there are still hundreds of plugins to migrate.
We invite contributors to participate in the project and to help us with migrating the docs.
It is also a great opportunity to update and copy-edit the documentation.
