The SIG offers a venue for all kinds of documentation creation, improvement, and delivery.

The group focuses on documentation for Jenkins, including:

* link:/doc/[User documentation] - Using Jenkins
** link:/doc/tutorials[Tutorials]
** link:/doc/book/[User Handbook]
** References like link:/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/[Pipeline Syntax] and link:/doc/pipeline/steps/[Pipeline Steps]
** link:/participate/how-to-guides/[How-to Guides]
* link:/doc/developer/[Developer documentation] - Extending Jenkins
** link:/doc/developer/tutorial/[Tutorials]
** link:/doc/developer/book/[Developer Reference]
** link:/doc/developer/guides/[How-To Guides]
* link:/solutions[Solution documentation] - using Jenkins with specific technologies (e.g. Java, PHP, or Docker).
  Also, implementation solutions like link:/solutions/pipeline[Pipeline]

Documentation SIG may cooperate with other groups.
For example, we will be cooperating with the link:/sigs/cloud-native[Cloud-Native Jenkins SIG]
on topics related to Cloud-Native documentation efforts and
with the link:/sigs/platform[Platform SIG].
on platform topics.

== Topics

* Creating new documentation
* Improving existing documentation
* Reviewing documentation contributions
* Coordinating documentation initiatives
* Reviewing Jenkins Enhancement Proposals (JEPs) related to documentation

== Contributing

See link:/participate/document[this page] for information about contributing to Jenkins documentation.
It contains links for newcomer and seasoned contributors.
If you have any questions or ideas, please feel free to reach out to us using the channels listed on the right panel.

[[ongoing-projects]]
== Projects

This section lists some of the projects working under the direction of this SIG.
See the link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uNNo0QJKPHnNp8PGr_jLI8p3K_94ZYD-M0evZOEZ93c/edit?usp=sharing[SIG meeting notes] for more information about ongoing projects.

=== Google Season of Docs

Google Season of Docs brings together open source communities and technical writers for the benefit of both.
The program raises awareness of open source, of documentation, and of technical writing.

See our link:/sigs/docs/gsod[Google Season of Docs status page] for documentation project ideas, contact information, and more.

=== Plugin site integration with GitHub

link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/[Jenkins Plugin Site] currently uses Jenkins update center and link:https://wiki.jenkins.io/[Jenkins Wiki] as a main source of information to be displayed on the website.
We have recently added support of plugin documentation from GitHub (link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jenkinsci-dev/VSdfVMDIW-A[announcement]), 
but there are still many improvement areas: visualizing changelogs, pulling plugin tags and maintainers list from GitHub, etc.
This project is tracked in the jira:WEBSITE-637[] EPIC.

=== Plugin documentation on GitHub

Currently the SIG is migrating plugin documentation from https://wiki.jenkins.io/ to GitHub.
Documentation in the plugin GitHub repository provides a good user experience for Jenkins users seeking documentation. 
At the same time, plugin maintainers now can follow the documentation-as-code approach and make documentation changes a part of the pull requests. 
It also gives an opportunity to review the documentation changes and to add documentation contributor recognition, 
especially if the story is combined with link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/.github/blob/master/.github/release-drafter.adoc[changelog automation]. 

We have more than 300 plugins which already use GitHub as a documentation source,
but there are still hundreds of plugins to migrate.
We invite contributors to participate in the project and to help us with migrating the docs.
It is also a great opportunity to update and copy-edit the documentation.

[[user-guide]]
=== User Guide Rework

Jenkins user topics are included in the current link:/doc/book[Jenkins Handbook].
link:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nA8xVOkyKmZ8oTYSLdwjborT0w-BpBNNZT0nxR9deZ8/edit#gid=1087292709[Feedback requests] are frequently received to improve user documentation.
Common improvement themes include adding migration of the documentation from Wiki, pipeline examples with each of the pipeline steps, additional tutorials for new users, better search and navigation.

* link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/projects/1[GitHub Project]

[[administrator-guide]]
=== Administrator Guide

Jenkins administration topics are included in the current link:/doc/book[Jenkins Handbook].
Navigation can be improved for administrators by separating the administration topics into a separate volume.
This project will create a separate Jenkins Administrator Guide with content specific for administrators.
This project is tracked in the jira:WEBSITE-738[] EPIC.

[[solution-pages]]
=== Solution Pages

Jenkins link:/solutions/[solution pages] highlight specific use cases for Jenkins users.
Those solutions include SCM provider solutions (link:/solutions/github[GitHub], link:/solutions/bitbucketserver[Bitbucket]),
programming language solutions (link:/solutions/python[Python], link:/solutions/ruby[Ruby], link:/solutions/c[C/C++], link:/solutions/java[Java], and link:/solutions/php[PHP]),
and execution environment solutions (link:/solutions/python[Pipeline], link:/solutions/docker[Docker], link:/solutions/embedded[Embedded], and link:/solutions/android[Android]).
An excellent link:/solutions/[opening page] has been provided by link:https://github.com/zbynek[Zbynek Konecny].
Additional use cases and user stories are being collected by link:https://github.com/alyssat[Alyssa Tong].

The appearance and navigation of those solution pages needs improvement.
The existing pages should be revisited and improved so that users of specific solutions can find what they need on jenkins.io.
This project is tracked in the jira:WEBSITE-742[] EPIC.
