        Artwork

      %p
        The original Jenkins logo was created by our friends at
        %a{:href => 'https://frontside.io/'}
          Frontside.
        Special thanks to
        %a{:href => 'https://github.com/cowboyd'}
          Charles Lowell
        for his efforts championing the logo's original design. Usage
        guidelines for the original logo can be found on our
        %a{:href => '/press'}
          Press
        page. This page simply catalogues the many clever variations of Jenkins
        created by members of the Jenkins community.
