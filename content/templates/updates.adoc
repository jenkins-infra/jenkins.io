== Default Update Site

This is the default Jenkins update site.
It is configured by default on every Jenkins instance.
Its content is periodically generated by https://github.com/jenkins-infra/update-center2/[jenkins-infra/update-center2].

=== Configuration

To configure this default update site in Jenkins, specify `+https://updates.jenkins.io/update-center.json+` in _Manage Jenkins » Manage Plugins » Advanced_.

This file serves JSONP despite the file name. See `+https://updates.jenkins.io/update-center.actual.json+` for the JSON variant, and https://github.com/jenkins-infra/update-center2/blob/master/site/LAYOUT.md[Site Layout] for an explanation of the different files and directories available on this site.

=== Version-Specific Update Sites

Jenkins adds a query parameter `?version` to the update site URL.
This lets the update site offer plugin releases compatible with your version of Jenkins.
At the moment, Jenkins weekly and LTS releases up to a year old are supported; anything older will receive update metadata for the oldest supported releases.

See https://github.com/jenkins-infra/update-center2/tree/master/site[OSS Update Center Architecture] for more information.

== Experimental Plugin Site

The experimental plugin site is located at https://updates.jenkins.io/experimental/[https://updates.jenkins.io/experimental/].
Configure `+https://updates.jenkins.io/experimental/update-center.json+` in Jenkins to receive experimental releases (those with `alpha` or `beta` in their version numbers).

See https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/publishing/releasing-experimental-updates/[Publishing Experimental Plugin Releases] for more information.

This update site always serves the latest releases, which may be incompatible with your version of Jenkins.
