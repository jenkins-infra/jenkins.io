Jenkins is an open source automation server with a vibrant community of users and contributors. 
As an open source project, Jenkins offers community-based support through various channels.

== Support Expectations

As an open source project, Jenkins operates on a community-based support model:

* **Community-driven support**: Help comes from fellow Jenkins users and contributors, not paid support staff
* **Best-effort basis**: Support is provided by volunteers on their own time
* **Self-service oriented**: The community provides extensive documentation and resources for self-help
* **No guaranteed response times**: Response times depend on volunteer availability and issue complexity
