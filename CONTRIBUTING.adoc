== Getting Started

To contribute to this repository you will
link:https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/[fork this repository],
push changes to a branch in your fork, and then
link:https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/[create as a pull request]
from that branch to the `master` branch of this repository.
Forking only needs to be done once, after which you can push changes to your fork
using the GitHub website file editor or from a local clone, as described below.

[[newcomers]]
=== Information for newcomers

The documentation below describes common cases for contributors.
If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask in link:https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/newcomer-contributors[newcomers] or link:https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/docs[Documentation SIG] Gitter chats.
If you have any feedback about your contributor experience, please also share it with us in these channels so that we can improve our guidelines.

[[forking]]
=== Creating a fork

Creating a fork, aka link:https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/[forking],
makes a personal copy of another repository.
Any changes you make in your fork of the repository will not show up on the website
until they are merged (via pull request) to the `master` branch of this repository.
If you are unfamiliar with how to create a fork or how forks work, see the
link:link:https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/[GitHub tutorial on forking].

=== Using GitHub to edit files

GitHub makes it easy to add, edit, or delete individual files via their website's
link:https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/[File Editor].
This has the advantage of using the file editor is that GitHub will automatically fork (if needed),
push the changes to a branch, and open a pull request for you.
It also means you don't need to have a local clone of your fork.
The disadvantage is that you can't verify you changes locally before creating the PR,
it only works on one file at a time, and your changes are lost if you close or navigate away from the page.

=== Using a local clone

We generally recommend making changes in a
link:https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository-from-github/[local clone] of your fork.
This requires some additional tools and storage on your local machine,
and you will need a bit more technical knowledge of how to use those tools.
However, this will allow you work on multiple files as part of a single set of changes.
You'll save your changes in a local branch and then <<building, build and review>> them locally.
When they are ready you will push your changes to your your fork and submit a pull request from there.

== Building

This project uses GNU/Make and Docker in order to generate the fully statically
generated link:https://jenkins.io[jenkins.io] web site. The key tool for
converting source code into the site is the
link:https://github.com/awestruct/awestruct[Awestruct] static site generator,
which is downloaded automatically as part of the build process.

Ensure you have GNU/Make and Docker available on your machine:

* `make --version`
* `docker version`

Docker must be version 17.04 or greater.

[[make-targets]]
=== `make` Targets

Run `make` to run a full build, or `make <target>` using one of the targets below
to achieve specific results.

* *all* (default target) will run a full build of the site, including
  `prepare`, `generate`, and `archive`. This will also download and regenerate external resources.
* *clean* will remove all build output and dependencies in preparation for a full rebuild.
* *prepare* will download external dependencies and resources necessary to
  build the site. As an optimization to make iterating on content locally more pleasant,
  dependencies and resources will not be downloaded again unless the `clean` target is called first.
  The exeception being `all` will download and regenerate external resources
  (but not download dependencies which are more bandwidth intensive).
* *generate* will run `site` and `pdfs`.
* *site* will explicitly generate static website files.
* *pdfs* will explicitly generate new PDFs
* *run* will run a live-reloading development server on
  link:http://localhost:4242/[localhost:4242].
* *user-site* will publish the `jenkins.io` website to your own "GitHub Pages".
  While useful for review purposes this has some known issues and limitations.
  See <<user-site>> for details.


== Editing content

The majority of what is considered "legacy" content is almost entirely under
`content/blog`. These files represent structured around the date the original
stories were written in Drupal.

Most content on this site is written up in the AsciiDoc markup language.


==== Why AsciiDoc?

Generally speaking, all documentation should be written in
link:https://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/[AsciiDoc]. While most open
source contributors are familiar with
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown[Markdown], it has limitations which
make writing in-depth documentation with it problematic. Markdown, as opposed to
link:https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/[GitHub flavored
Markdown], does not have support for denoting what language source code might be
written in. AsciiDoc supports this natively with the "source code" block:

[source, asciidoc]
----
[source, asciidoc]
\----
This is where I would _cite_ some highlighted AsciiDoc code
\----
----

AsciiDoc has a number of other features which can make authoring of
documentation easier, such as the
"link:https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/#admon-bl[admonition blocks]"
which help call out specific sections, such as:

[source, asciidoc]
----
NOTE: This is a notice that you should pay attention to!

CAUTION: This is a common mistake!
----

Becomes:

NOTE: This is a notice that you should pay attention to!

CAUTION: This is a common mistake!


There are too many other helpful macros and formatting options to list here, so
it is recommended that you refer to the
link:https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference[quick reference]
to become more familiar with what is available.


=== Adding a blog post

In order to add a new blog post, create a new file ending in **.adoc** (for
link:https://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor]) in the appropriate
`content/blog/<year>/<month>` directory with the full date and a *lower-case*
title for your post. In effect, if you're writing a post that you want to title
"Hello World" on January 1st, 1970, you would create the file:
`content/blog/1970/01/1970-01-01-hello-world.adoc`.

In that file you need to enter some meta-data in the following format:

.1970-01-01-hello-world.adoc
[source,yaml]
----
---
layout: post
title: "Hello World!"
tags:
- jenkins
- timetravel
author: yourgithubname
description: "Short summary for search engines and social media" # optional
opengraph:
  image: /images/folder/icon.png # optional
note: "Here you can mention that this is a guest post" # optional
---
----

This section is referred to as the
link:https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/[front matter]. The `layout`
attribute tells the rendering engine to use the "post" layout.
`title` will be the displayed title of the post.

`tags` are descriptive terms for this post.
They can be used to search for all posts for a specific or area,
such as "tutorials" or "plugins".
Tags must contain only numbers and lower-case letters.
Tags must not contain spaces.
Tags should be short, generally one or two words.
Tags containing multiple words should squash all the words together,
as in "continuousdelivery" or "jenkinsworld2017".
Dashes are allowed but should be avoided unless describing a topic that contains
dashes, such as a plugin name that contains dashes.
To see tags people have used before:

[source,sh]
----
egrep -h '^- [^ ]+$' content/blog/*/*/*.adoc | sort | uniq -c
----

The `author` attribute will map your
GitHub name to author information, if this is your first time adding a blog
post, please also create an "author" file in `content/_data/authors/` with the
file named `yourgithubname.adoc`. The format of this file should be:

.yourgithubname.adoc
[source, asciidoc]
----
---
name: "Your Display Name"
twitter: meontwitter
github: yourgithubname
---

This is an *AsciiDoc* formatted bio, but it is completely optional!
---
----

Only the `name:` and `github:` sections are mandatory.

You may also add an avatar image file for yourself in `content/images/avatars/`
with the file named `yourgithubname.jpg`.
You can use an image file with one of the following extensions:
`.bmp`, `.gif`, `.ico`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.svg`.

Once your author file is defined, you can return to your blog post file
(`1970-01-01-hello-world.adoc`), finish creating the "front matter" and then
write your blog post!

Images for blog posts should be placed in subdirectories of the 'content/images/post-images/' directory.
If a blog post is describing 'feature-x' then the images might be in 'content/images/post-images/feature-x/'.

The `opengraph` section is optional. It allows you to define a preview of
the article for social media. The `image` attribute should be a PNG or JPEG image
with more than 200px in each dimension and preferred aspect ratio about 2:1. For
more information see the documentation for link:https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/webmasters/images/[Facebook],
and link:https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/summary-card-with-large-image.html[Twitter].

The `note` will be shown as a note at the top of the post,
but will be omitted from the post summary on the blog front page. 
It is intended for identifying posts by guest authors and posts that were also published somewhere else.

Once you have everything ready, you may
link:https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/[create a pull
request] containing your additions.

TIP: If you're unfamiliar with the AsciiDoc syntax, please consult this
link:https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[handy quick
reference guide].


=== Adding documentation

This repository holds the central documentation for the Jenkins project, which
can be broken down into three categories:

. *Jenkins User Documentation* - for people who want to _use_ Jenkins's existing
  functionality and plugin features. The documentation model that the content is
  based on is described in Daniele Procida's blog post
  "link:https://www.divio.com/en/blog/documentation/[What nobody tells you about
  documentation]". Refer to the
  <<jenkins-user-documentation,Jenkins User Documentation>> section below for
  details on how this content is structured.
. *Extend Jenkins Documentation* - this documentation is for people who want to
  _extend_ the functionality of Jenkins by developing their own Jenkins plugins.
  Like the Jenkins User Documentation (above), the content is based on the same
  link:https://www.divio.com/en/blog/documentation/[documentation model]. The
  content for this set of documentation is written up as a combination of
  `.haml` and `.adoc` files located in the
  link:content/doc/developer[`content/doc/developer/`]
  directory. Read more about adding pages to this documentation in
  <<adding-a-stand-alone-page,Adding a stand-alone-page>>.
. *Solution pages* - topic-specific destination pages providing a high-level
  overview of a topic with links into getting started guides, handbook chapters,
  relevant plugins and multimedia related to the topic. Be aware that some of
  this content might already be present in the Jenkins User / Extend Jenkins
  Documentation.

The documentation pages can use the same metadata (`title`, `description`, `opengraph:image`)
as blog posts.

==== Jenkins User Documentation

The Jenkins User Documentation consists of the following parts:

* *Tutorials* - these are step-by-step guides that teach users relatively new to
  Continuous Integration (CI) / Continuous Delivery (CD) concepts about how to
  implement their project (of a particular tech stack) in Jenkins. A tutorial's
  content is based on the "tutorial" description in Daniele Procida's blog post
  "link:https://www.divio.com/en/blog/documentation/[What nobody tells you about
  documentation]". Read more about
  <<adding-a-tutorial-page,Adding a Tutorial page>>.
* *How-to guides* - these are short guides consisting of procedures to get the
  reader started with specific/common use-case scenarios. They could also be
  guides that assist with overcoming commonly encountered issues - thereby
  behaving as a form of knowledgebase article. A how-to guide's content goes
  beyond the more general scope of a topic in the User Handbook, but these
  guides do not hand-hold or teach the reader using very specific scenarios
  (e.g. forking a given repo), as the *Tutorials* do. A how-to guide's content
  is based on the "how-to guide" description in Daniele Procida's blog post
  "link:https://www.divio.com/en/blog/documentation/[What nobody tells you about
  documentation]". While there are currently no "how-to guides" yet, this
  section will be added when good candidate guides arise.
* *User Handbook* - rich and in-depth documentation, separated into chapters,
  each of which covers a given topic/feature of Jenkins. This is conceptually
  and structurally similar to the
  link:https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/[FreeBSD
  Handbook]. The User Handbook covers the fundamentals on how to use Jenkins as
  well as content which is not explained in the *Tutorials* or *How-to Guides*
  (above). This content is based predominantly on the "reference" description in
  Daniele Procida's blog post
  "link:https://www.divio.com/en/blog/documentation/[What nobody tells you about
  documentation]" blog post, with appropriate "discussion"- (i.e.
  background/overview material) and general "how-to guide"- (i.e. specific to
  the chapter/topic in question) like material. Read more about
  <<adding-user-handbook-content,Adding User Handbook content>>.
* *Resources*:
** The Pipeline Syntax Reference is a link to the published
   link:content/doc/book/pipeline/syntax.adoc[syntax.adoc]
   reference page in the *User Handbook*.
** The Pipeline Steps Reference consists of Asciidoc files which are
   auto-generated from content within the relevant Pipeline plugin source code.
   Therefore, to contribute to this content, you need to edit the relevant
   plugin's source code.
* *Recent Tutorial Blog Posts* - these are a list of the most recently
  published blog posts presented as tutorials (and tagged with the *tutorial*
  tag).
* *Guided Tour* (Deprecated) - This part of the documentation is
  being decommissioned in favor of the *Tutorials* and *How-to guides*
  parts, both of which focus more on teaching people how to use Jenkins
  or helping people with specific use-cases. Once all the
  content from the *Guided Tour* is sufficiently captured in
  those other parts, this part will be removed. +
  Unless existing content in the *Guided Tour* needs to be updated
  because it is incorrect or misleading (perhaps as a result of a Jenkins
  update), avoid making additional contributions to this part.


==== Adding a Tutorial page

A tutorial is presented on its own page, each of which is written up as an
`.adoc` file located in the link:content/doc/tutorials[`content/doc/tutorials/`]
directory. If an `.adoc` file name begins with a underscore (e.g.
link:content/doc/tutorials/_prerequisites.adoc[`content/doc/tutorials/_prerequisites.adoc`]),
this means that the content is used as an
link:https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/#include-files[Asciidoc
inclusion] on another page.


==== Adding a How-to guide page

This section will be completed when the first (or first set of) "how-to guides"
are written up.


==== Adding User Handbook content

The different chapters for the Handbook are located in the
link:content/doc/book[`content/doc/book/`] directory.

To add a chapter:

. Add a new subdirectory (within this directory) whose name reflects your
  chapter title.
. Specify this subdirectory's name as a new entry in the
  link:content/doc/book/_book.yml[`content/doc/book/_book.yml`] file. The
  position of the entry in this file determines the order in which the chapter
  appears in the User Handbook.
. Create an `index.adoc` file within the subdirectory you created above. Feel
  free to copy another chapter's `index.adoc` content as a template/starting
  point. The content on this page should be an overview (i.e. "discussion"
  material) about the subject of this chapter (e.g. some big new Jenkins
  feature). +
  Once you do this, the chapters will automatically surface on the User Handbook
  home page
  (provided by
  link:content/doc/book/index.html.haml[`content/doc/book/index.html.haml`]),
  which will automatically appear https://jenkins.io/doc/book/[here] (and in the
  TOC on the left of this page) when accepted. +
  Once you do add some topics to this chapter page as well as additional pages
  of topics within a chapter (see below), it's recommended that you link to
  these topics from within the overview (to help readers find this information).

To add a page (i.e. "section") within a chapter:

. Within the relevant chapter subdirectory, create a new `.adoc` file whose name
  reflects your page title. Feel free to copy another section's `.adoc` content
  as a template/starting point.
. Specify this `.adoc` file's name as a new entry in a `_chapter.yml` file
  within this directory. Feel free to copy an empty `_chapter.yml` file from
  another subdirectory/chapter (e.g. from the `glossary` directory). The
  position of the entry in this file determines the order in which the page
  appears within the chapter. +
  Once you do this, the pages will automatically surface on the User Handbook
  home page
  (provided by
  link:content/doc/book/index.html.haml[`content/doc/book/index.html.haml`]),
  which will automatically appear https://jenkins.io/doc/book/[here] (and the
  TOC on the left of this page) when accepted. +
  The content on this page should be predominantly "reference" material about
  the subject of page (e.g. more detailed information about a specific aspect
  of the big new feature). These pages may contain appropriate "discussion"- and
  "how-to guide"-like material (i.e. overviews and procedures) relevant to the
  subject to make the content more useful.


==== Adding a Solution page

Solution pages are somewhat *special* insofar that they are not generally
AsciiDoc files, but rather link:http://haml.info[Haml] templates. All the
solution pages are located in the link:content/solutions[`content/solutions/`]
directory hierarchy, with some data provided for the solution pages in
link:content/_data/solutions[`content/_data/solutions/`].

IMPORTANT: The naming of Solution page template (`pipeline.html.haml`) must
match the data file in `content/_data/solutions`, e.g. `pipeline.yml`

New solution pages should help guide a reader to documentation and resources
about a very specific topic, or use-case, on Jenkins. How specific/niche the
solution pages should be requires a bit of judgement, for example "Jenkins for
Visual C++" is probably too niche to fill out a page with a rich set of plugins,
presentations and links to documentation.  A page "Jenkins for C/C++" would
still be relatively specific, and could easily include a section for Visual
C++/Windows specific content.

==== Moving documentation from Jenkins Wiki

Jenkins project still hosts a lot of documentation pages on link:https://wiki.jenkins.io[Jenkins Wiki].
Some documentation sections in this repository are marked as "work-in-progress", and they just refer Wiki.
It is recommended to move such pages to jenkins.io,
and it can be done in a semi-automated way using the link:https://jenkins-wiki-exporter.jenkins.io/[Jenkins Wiki Exporter] tool which is based on link:https://pandoc.org/[Pandoc].

. Open the Wiki page page you want to migrate, copy its URL
. Go to the link:https://jenkins-wiki-exporter.jenkins.io/[Jenkins Wiki Exporter] web page
. Paste the URL of the Wiki page you want to export
. Select the export option. Use __Asciidoc_ for pages without images or _Asciidoc Zip_ if you want to export images as well
. Click the _Convert_ button and wait till the files are generated
. Put the content and images to the right destinations in the repository
. Review/edit the exported file formatting
** Remove the macro references in the top of the document
** If the document includes "Table of contents", remove this section (or replace it by macros if needed)
** If the Wiki includes code blocks, they will need to be manually converted. Pandoc exports them as tables
. Review the content. 
** If there are any images in the exported pages, replace `todo-replace-by-actual-path` by the actual directory path (`/images/...`)
** Wiki pages are often outdated, and it is nice to review them before submitting (e.g. rename "slave" to "agent", "workflow" to "pipeline", "Hudson" to "Jenkins", etc.)
. Commit changes, push them to your fork and create a pull request against link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io[the repository]
. Once the pull request is merged, create an `INFRA` Jenkins JIRA ticket to replace the content on Wiki by a link to the new jenkins.io locations 

=== Adding an event

To add an event to the Jenkins event calendar, create a file in the
`https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/tree/master/content/_data/events[content/_data/events/]`
folder of this repo.

To create a file in this folder using the GitHub web editor,
link:https://github.com/jenkins-infra/jenkins.io/new/master/content/_data/events[open this page in a new tab].

Name the file using the pattern `<DATE>-<CITY><OPTIONAL_ID>.adoc`:

* DATE -
  The is the date of the event written as `YYYY-MM-DD`.
  For a multi-day event, use the starting day.
* CITY -
  The name of the city in lowercase letters without modifiers/accents
  (only the characters "a - z") and using dashes instead of spaces.
  For an online JAM, the city name should be "online".
* OPTIONAL_ID -
  If there is more than one event in the same city on a specific day,
  add an OPTIONAL_ID as a dash and a number (1-9).

Examples: `content/_data/events/2017-08-28-munchen.adoc`, `content/_data/events/2016-12-01-san-francisco-1.adoc`, `content/_data/events/2019-12-01-online-meetup.adoc`

Then, in that file put the following:

[source, asciidoc]
----
---
name: "<EVENT_NAME>"
location: "<LOCATION>"
date: "<DATE_TIME>"
link: "<LINK>"
---

<DESCRIPTION>
----

* EVENT_NAME - The name of the event.  
  Note, this is not _subject_ of the event, but the _name_. Example: "Seattle JAM", "Jenkins World 2017".
  Basically, take a look at the events list on 
  link:https://jenkins.io/events/[] as though you were trying to choose events you would go to. 
  "August JAM" is not specific enough, but "Jenkins World 2017" is.
* LOCATION - Location of the meetup. The recommended format is `CITY, COUNTRY`, e.g. "Seattle, USA" or "Paris, France".
  States may be specified if needed.
  Use "Online" for online events like link:https://www.meetup.com/Jenkins-online-meetup/[Jenkins Online Meetup]
* DATE_TIME - The date and time of the event in the format: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:00`.
  The time should be when the event occurs in the local time zone and always using 24-hour format.
  For online JAMs, use Pacific Time.
* LINK - a link to a page with more event information.  For meetup
* DESCRIPTION - A description of the event in asciidoc format.
  This may include the name and bio of the speakers, the subjects to be presented,
  links to related content, or any other information that seems relevant.
+
The description may be written in a local language for the event,
  and using any unicode characters desired.
  If not written in a language understood by the submitter of the event,
  the submitter must do due diligence to make sure what is being posted is appropriate content -
  either by asking someone for help or using translation software.

Examples:

.content/_data/events/2017-08-28-san-francisco.adoc
[source, asciidoc]
----
---
name: "Jenkins World 2017"
date: "2017-08-28T09:00:00"
link: "https://www.cvent.com/events/jenkins-world-2017/event-summary-1d623ea19a4a4af58e9a207ff0f020db.aspx"
---

Jenkins World is THE event for everything Jenkins - community, CloudBees, ecosystem, and DevOps.
----

.content/_data/events/2017-06-13-seattle.adoc
[source, asciidoc]
----
---
title: "Seattle JAM"
date: "2017-06-13T18:00:00"
link: "https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-Jenkins-Area-Meetup/events/240428203/"

Zero to Continuous Delivery with Jenkins Blue Ocean

Presenter: Kohsuke Kawaguchi
----

If using the GitHub UI to create this file,
commit the file using the "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request" option.
If working via a local clone, commit the change, push to a branch, and start a PR as usual.

=== Adding a stand-alone page

Encouraged formats:

* link:https://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor] (basic content creation)
  (link:https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc
  syntax quick reference])
* link:http://haml.info[Haml] (more advanced/custom page)
  (link:http://haml.info/docs/yardoc/file.REFERENCE.html[Haml syntax reference])

Adding a new page is as easy as adding a a new file to the
link:content/[`content/`] directory. It is important to keep in mind that the
filename you choose *will be the URL of your page*, so ensure you have a
*lower-case* and useful filename.


The link:content/index.html.haml[`content/index.html.haml`] page is one such
example of a special-case, standalone page.


==== Clean URLs

In order to have a clean URL, e.g. "https://jenkins.io/my-clean-url", you would
need to create a directory with your content in it. Using the above example, I
would create the directory `content/my-clean-url` and if I were creating an
Asciidoc file, I would then create the file `content/my-clean-url/index.adoc`.
(Advanced Haml users would create `content/my-clean-url/index.html.haml`).

=== Adding a Logo

In order to add a new logo, please submit a pull request, 
adding a new metadata `.yml` file in `content/_data/logo` and a 
new directory containing the logo assets into `content/images/logos/`.

Requirements to the images:

* All submitted images are licensed under the link:https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/[Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License]
* At least 2 images are needed: full-size PNG and another PNG which has a 256px height
** Images should not contain the "Jenkins" or other text in the bottom like you may see on stickers.
   We publish only logos on the site, text can be added in credits
** It is recommended to add PNGs without background
** PNGs should be losslessly optimized using special tools for that, e.g. link:https://pmt.sourceforge.io/pngcrush/[pngcrush]
* SVG or other vector formats can be added to the image 

Each logo is identified by a unique ID (e.g. `imageId`), all images should be stored in a `content/images/logos/${imageId}`.
Metadata file for the image would be `content/_data/logo/${imageId}`.
Sample of such metadata file:

```yaml
---
name: 'My Jenkins'
url: '/images/logos/${imageId}/${imageId}.png'
url_256: '/images/logos/${imageId}/256.png'
vector: '/images/logos/${imageId}/${imageId}.svg'
credit: 'Your Name'
credit_url: 'https://twitter.com/yourtwitteraccount'
```

[[reviewing]]
== Reviewing changes

There are many pull requests being submitted to jenkins.io every week.
Reviews are driven by the community, and any contributions are always welcome.
There is also a link:https://github.com/orgs/jenkins-infra/teams/copy-editors[Copy Editors] team which performs reviews and merges, 
but such reviews may take some time depending on availability of contributors.

Some tips:

* Pull requests are open to public, and any GitHub user can review changes and provide feedback.
  If you are interested to review changes, please just do so (and thanks in advance!). 
  No special permissions needed
* If you need help with reviews for documentation changes,
  you can in the link:https://gitter.im/jenkinsci/docs[Documentation SIG Gitter channel].
* If you are interested to join the Copy Editors team, 
  you can request membership in the link:https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-dev[Jenkins Developer mailing list].
  Such membership requires a track of contributions to Jenkins, and also a signed link:https://github.com/jenkinsci/infra-cla[Contributor License Agreement]

[[user-site]]
== Deploying jenkins.io on GitHub pages

There is rudimentary support for publishing the `jenkins.io` website to your own
link:https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/#enabling-github-pages-to-publish-your-site-from-master-or-gh-pages[GitHub Pages]
for demonstration purposes. This feature is useful if you want to show reviewers
what your changes will actually look like on the production website,
without reviewers needing to fetch and build those changes locally.

To generate your site from local changes:

. Make changes in a local branch (for example, `my_branch_name`).
. Run the command `make user-site GITHUB_USER=<your_username>`,
  replacing `<your_username>` with your GitHub user name. This will regenerate
  the site based on your changes and push it to `origin/gh-pages` (of your
  `jenkins.io` fork on GitHub). +
  **NOTE**: If your local `gh-pages` or `origin/gh-pages` branches don't exist,
  these will be created automatically.
. Assuming this process completes successfully (it might initially take a
  while), your changes will be visible to anyone under
  `https://<your_username>.github.io/jenkins.io/my_branch_name`.

For example, if my user name were `jenkinscontributor` and I were working
locally in a branch called `siteredesign`, I would run the command
`make user-site GITHUB_USER=jenkinscontributor`. When done, people would be able
to see the site with my `siteredesign` branch changes at the URL
`https://jenkinscontributor.github.io/jenkins.io/siteredesign`.

"Rudimentary support" (above) means there are a number of known issues and if
anything doesn't work, you're on your own.

Known issues/limitations:

* Images and other internal site links that use _absolute_ path references
  (as opposed to _relative_ paths) will appear broken or "not found".
