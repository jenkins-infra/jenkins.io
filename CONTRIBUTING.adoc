== Building

Ensure you have GNU/Make and Docker available on your machine:

* `make --version`
* `docker version`

Docker must be version 17.04 or greater.

=== Instructions

This project uses GNU/Make and Docker in order to generate the fully statically
generated link:https://jenkins.io[jenkins.io] web site. The key tool for
converting source code into the site is the
link:http://awestruct.org[Awestruct] static site generator.

==== Make Targets

* *make prepare* will download external dependencies and files necessary to
  build the site. It is recommended that this be executed at least once before
  authoring new content. This target is not a dependency of `run` or `generate`
  as an optimization to make iterating on content locally more pleasant.
* *make run* will run a live-reloading development server on
  link:http://localhost:4242/[localhost:4242]
* *make pdfs* will explicitly generate new PDFs

== Editing content

The majority of what is considered "legacy" content is almost entirely under
`content/blog`. These files represent structured around the date the original
stories were written in Drupal.

=== Adding a blog post

In order to add a new blog post, create a new file ending in **.adoc** (for
link:http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor]) in the appropriate
`content/blog/<year>/<month>` directory with the full date and a *lower-case* title for
your post. In effect, if you're writing a post that you want to title "Hello
World" on January 1st, 1970, you would create the file:
`content/blog/1970/01/1970-01-01-hello-world.adoc`.

In that file you need to enter some meta-data in the following format:

.1970-01-01-hello-world.adoc
[source,yaml]
----
---
layout: post
title: "Hello World!"
tags:
- jenkins
- timetravel
author: yourgithubname
---
----

This section is referred to as the
link:http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/[front matter]. The `layout`
attribute tells the rendering engine to use the "post" layout.
`title` will be the displayed title of the post.

`tags` are descriptive terms for this post.
They can be used to search for all posts for a specific or area,
such as "tutorials" or "plugins".
Tags must contain only numbers and lower-case letters.
Tags must not contain spaces.
Tags should be short, generally one or two words.
Tags containing multiple words should squash all the words together,
as in "continuousdelivery" or "jenkinsworld2017".
Dashes are allowed but should be avoided unless describing a topic that contains dashes,
such as a plugin name that contains dashes.

The `author` attribute will map your
GitHub name to author information, if this is your first time adding a blog
post, please also create an "author" file in `content/_data/authors/` with the
file named `yourgithubname.adoc`. The format of this file should be:

.yourgithubname.adoc
[source, asciidoc]
----
---
name: "Your Display Name"
twitter: meontwitter
github: yourgithubname
---

This is an *AsciiDoc* formatted bio, but it is completely optional!
---
----

Only the `name:` and `github:` sections are mandatory.

Once your author file is defined, you can return to your blog post file
(`1970-01-01-hello-world.adoc`), finish creating the "front matter" and then
write your blog post!

Once you have everything ready, you may
link:https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/[create a pull request]
containing your additions.

TIP: If you're unfamiliar with the AsciiDoc syntax, please consult this link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[handy quick reference guide].

=== Adding documentation

This repository holds the central documentation for the Jenkins project. The
documentation can be broken down into three categories:

. *Knowledge-base/Handbook* - rich and in-depth documentation, separated into
  chapters covering a topic area, conceptually similar to the
  link:https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/[FreeBSD Handbook]
. *Getting Started guides* - topic-specific, progressive documentation walking
  the reader through the topic
. *Solution pages* - topic-specific destination pages providing a high-level
  overview of a topic with links into getting started guides, handbook chapters,
  relevant plugins and multimedia related to the topic

==== Why AsciiDoc?

Generally speaking, all documentation should be written in
link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/[AsciiDoc]. While most open
source contributors are familiar with
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown[Markdown] it has limitations which
make writing in-depth documentation with it problematic.Markdown, as opposed to
link:https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/[GitHub flavored Markdown],
does not have support for denoting what language source code might be
written in. AsciiDoc supports this natively with the "source code" block:

[source, asciidoc]
----
[source, asciidoc]
\----
This is where I would _cite_ some highlighted AsciiDoc code
\----
----

AsciiDoc has a number of other features which can make authoring of
documentation easier, such as the
"link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/#admon-bl[admonition blocks]"
which help call out specific sections, such as:

[source, asciidoc]
----
NOTE: This is a notice that you should pay attention to!

CAUTION: This is a common mistake!
----

Becomes:

NOTE: This is a notice that you should pay attention to!

CAUTION: This is a common mistake!


There are too many other helpful macros and formatting options to list here, so it
is recommended that you refer to the link:asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference[quick reference]
to become more familiar with what is available.


==== Adding a Handbook chapter

The different chapters for the Handbook are located in the `content/doc/book/` directory
and generally speaking each `.adoc` file represents a single chapter of the book.
Chapters are automatically surfaced on the Handbook home page (provided by
`content/doc/book.html.haml`).

==== Adding a Getting Started Guide

Unlike Handbook chapters, Getting Started Guides should be directed, that is to
say: the sentence "Getting Started with X" should make sense. "Getting Started
with Jenkins on Windows", "Getting Started with Pipeline", "Getting Started with
Access Control".

These getting started guides can be placed in `content/doc/` in a directory that
is most appropriate for the topic, and the directory should contain the `.adoc`
file for the Getting Started Guide, as well as any supplementary images or other
assets to accompany
the guide.

TIP: Writing a Getting Started Guide while authoring a Handbook chapter on the
subject can help ensure your Getting Started Guide can cite more detailed
documentation for how/why certain features exist, or provide a useful reference
point for "advanced" features.


==== Adding a Solution page

Solution pages are somewhat *special* insofar that they are not generally AsciiDoc files,
but rather link:http://haml.info[Haml] templates. All the solution pages are located
in the `content/solutions/` directory hierarchy, with some data provided for the solution
pages in `content/_data/solutions/`.

IMPORTANT: The naming of Solution page template (`pipeline.html.haml`) must
match the data file in `content/_data/solutions`, e.g. `pipeline.yml`

New solution pages should help guide a reader to documentation and resources
about a very specific topic, or use-case, on Jenkins. How specific/niche the
solution pages should be requires a bit of judgement, for example "Jenkins for
Visual C++" is probably too niche to fill out a page with a rich set of plugins,
presentations and links to documentation.  A page "Jenkins for C/C++" would
still be relatively specific, and could easily include a section for Visual
C++/Windows specific content.

=== Adding a stand-alone page

Encouraged formats:

* link:http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor] (basic content creation) (link:http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc syntax quick reference])
* link:http://haml.info[Haml] (more advanced/custom page) (link:http://haml.info/docs/yardoc/file.REFERENCE.html[Haml syntax reference]

Adding a new page is as easy as adding a a new file to the `content/`
directory. It is important to keep in mind that the filename you choose *will
be the URL of your page*, so ensure you have a *lower-case* and useful
filename.


The `content/index.html.haml` page is one such example of a special-case,
standalone page.


==== Clean URLs

In order to have a clean URL, e.g. "https://jenkins.io/my-clean-url", you would
need to create a directory with your content in it. Using the above example, I
would create the directory `content/my-clean-url` and if I were creating an
Asciidoc file, I would then create the file `content/my-clean-url/index.adoc`.
(Advanced Haml users would create `content/my-clean-url/index.html.haml`).


== Deploying on GitHub pages

There is rudimentary (as in if it doesn't work, you're on your own) support for
publishing the static site to GitHub Pages for demonstration purposes using the
link:http://awestruct.org/auto-deploy-to-github-pages/#awestruct-deployer[Awestruct Deployer].

This requires adding a
link:http://awestruct.org/profiles/[profile]
 to `content/_config/site.yml` for your fork, and manually operating
 `awestruct`
